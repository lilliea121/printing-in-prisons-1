Section were justly pleased with the Entertainment provided for them thru the joint efforts of Miss Russell, and Mr. Kraupa, who have so accurately judged the tastes of the great majority of our members, and act accordingly. It was a Superlative Show, from Pictures to Speeches, of which we had several, including Miss Russell’s remarks on Pills, and Mistaken Identity, Mr. Kraupa’s on the Kiddie’s Kmas Fund; and His Excellency, the President’s on the need for remaining seated at the performance’s close. The Cavaliere Toni, and his Orchestra Elite, furnished the sweetest of music to gladden the short period of waiting; while a particularly pleasant surprise was the appearance of Miss Angellotti, as Pianist, after a long absence. The Picture of the afternoon, was “The Boss of the Lazy Y.” a tale of the great West, and for an hour or more the satisfied audience, free of all restraint of bars, free of ‘the open spaces, and rode, and fought, and made heroic love, with the dashing hero. During a pause in the entertainment, Mr. Kraupa, made the announcement, that Mr. Garrick, of the Universal Company, was present, and had been moved to offer the famous feature film, “The Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin” for presentation on the coming Saturday. We are very much in debt to Mr. Garrick for this most generous action. The Vaudeville Bill was opened by Mie Bert Stanley attacking the audience with a rapid-fire of jokes which “got over” very successfully, indeed. Mr. George Wagner, who had journeyed all the way from . Washington, that he might be present to assist in our entertainment, followed, in a comedy act, which easily captured the favor of the audience. Bessie &amp; Al Kaufman, presented a little sketch, he as a stage-door keeper, the lady as a supposedly innocent country maiden, which had a totally unexpected ending, and was much liked by the audience. Lesble &amp; Reese, succeeded, in more than sense, in a dancing act which was very greatly appreciated. Emily &amp; Ray, juvenile singers and dancers, made the hit of the afternoon, and merited the abundant applause they received. Master Ray’s singing of “Dear Old Mother of Mine’? won him an ovation from his hearers. Miss Selma Corbett, to whom we tender the most abject apologies for having wished upon her the name of Carvel, in our last week’s issue, was again with us, and made as great a success as before, with her role of the old black “Mammy”. A juvenile act presented by the Misses, Schewer, Baker, and Crane. closed the Bill, and was an artistic triumph; little Miss Schewer’s exhibition of toe dancing promises a brilliant future for that young lady, and we have hopes of seeing her at the Opera at-no distant day, while her colleagues were equally good in their respective lines. Mr, Kraupa closed the day’s Entertainment with the presentation of a farce, “His Sudden Rival’? which was a very happy ending to a “perfect day” B 8266 Secretary.</p>
