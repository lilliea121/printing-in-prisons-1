<h1>A Revised Version with All Due Apologies to the Shade of Tom Hood</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>A REVISED VERSION WITH ALL DUE APOLOGIES TO THE SHADE OF TOM HOOD. I remember, I remember, the house where I was born; The pleasant smell of griddle-cakes that waked me every morn: The heaping plate of griddle-cakes, with gravy on the side, And all the little “sassidges” fair bursting in their pride. I remember I remember, how I galloped down the stair, And the grunt of satisfaction with which I pusht back my chair; Now my days are spent in loning, and my nights in wild regret, And in envy of my brothers who are doing these things yet. I remember, I remember, when the dinner bell would ring. I would not have traded places, emperor, or king; There was never queen, or empress who could bake like mother could; I bet she’d baked a million pies, and all of them were good. I remember, I remember, —and I wish I could forget— In the two years of my stay here, nota griddle-cake I’ve met; And I’ve just been to the cupboard, and no single pie was there: I remember, I remember, where I’m at —and want to swear. B 8266</p>
