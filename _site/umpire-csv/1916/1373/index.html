<h1>Forget And Pass On</h1>

<p>FORGET AND PASS ONTruly this is a wonderful world we are living in, and one of the most desirable gifts we may enjoy is the opportunity to help make this life a little brighter by some good, well directed effort to improve our conditions.Undoubtedly you will meet some people in this world whom you will not like, and others who may not like you. But this is of little consequence unless you give it attention. The better plan is just to forget all about it and pass it on.Success in any walk of life requires that a man must forget the little things that anger him. Your best interest demand that you should be a good forgetter. For the time that you waste in thinking of some wrong done to you by another, is not only time lost, and energy wasted, but it is a positive hinderance to your own advancement. Harboring a spirit of revenge only unfits you for any responsibility or accomplishment. Not only that, it is the sure indication of a very small man of dwarfed abilities. The broad minded forget or brush aside the little fellow who may try to annoy them, and they become stronger for it. Harboring a spirit of malice, trying to work injuring to another, or wasting energy on an enemy, will surely result in impending your own progress, and will leave your mind in a state that has never been known to work the slightest good.</p>
