<p>JUDGE RULES THAT “FINDINGS IS KEEPINGS” In a recent opinion handed down in the Circuit Court, Judge Dawkins declared “findings were keepings,” and held Walter H Mettle, a grocer’s clerk, entitled to $1800 found in the cellar of a house over the possession of which four litigants and seven lawyers disputed more than a week. Mettle found the money January 12, 1914, beneath some rubbish. He took it to the Assistant State Attorney who placed it in a bank. The present owner of the store, as well as the former owner and another party, who once lived in the same building, put in claims. The court said: ‘I believe that the title is in the finder against the while world, save the real owner, and while the matter is enshrouded in mystery, I must accept the old dictum that “findings is keepings” when the owner cannot be discovered after diligent effort.”</p>
