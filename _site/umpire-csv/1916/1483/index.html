<p>DO SOMETHING TO ATTAIN RESULTS Most of us have an object or ideal to attain in life, but for some reason it may seem doubtful of accomplishment. In many cases this doubt is engendered by a lack of determination to fit ourselves for the realization of that which is desired. Ideals will take form if you put your will, faith, and powers of self-expression behind it, and as a promientn educator says, that “indefinite absorption without production is fatal both to character and to the highest intellectual developement. Do something and be able to do it well; express what you know in some healthful and substancial form; produce and do not everlastingly feel, only, and revel in feeling.” In case that is your difficulty, you think and feel, but do not produce enough. Self-expression, initiative, will help in the realization of most of your ideals. No matter how small or contracted your present opportunities may seem, make the most of them, and do not allow an opportunity to pass, no matter how small it may be, for advancing a little toward the realization of your desires. Remembering the while that it is not so much “what we may do, as the way we do it,” that paves the way to final success.</p>
