<h1>The Bible As Literature</h1>

<p>THE BIBLE AS LITERATURE “We have been learning during the last half century that a knowledge of English literature in an indispensable element in public education;” writes a prominent author, “that in getting to know,” as Matthew Arnold contended, ‘the best that has been said and thought in the wosld,” we broaden our horizons and purify our ideals, and thus prepare ourselves for the duties of citizenship. Our colleges and universities have been enforcing this truth upon us by requirements of admission. “But if a knowledge of literature in indispensable to the education of a citizen, acquaintance with the English Bible is surely fundamental for that knowledge. All out best English literature is shot through and through with Biblical quotations, maxims, metaphors, characters, allusions; the one book with which a reader needs to have familiar acquaintance is the English Bible. It is ridiculous for any one to undertake to teach English literature who does not know his Bible at least as well as he knows his Shakespeare. On the pages he is undertaking to elucidate he will meet the Bible five times where he will meet Shakespeare once. For purpose of critical exposition, it is certainly quite as necessary for him to understand Jacob as to understand Shylock; familiarity with job is of greater practical value than familiarity with “Paradise Lost.”</p>
