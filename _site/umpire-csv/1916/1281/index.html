<h1>Prisoners Play Ball Outside Of Walls</h1>

<img width="200" src="/assets/img/" />
<p>PRISONERS PLAY BALL OUTSIDE OF WALLSA report from Columbus, O., states that forty five prisoners unguarded, left the Ohio State Penitentiary walls one day last week and went to the Columbus American Association Ball Park, where they participated in a ball game, either as players or rooters, and returned again at night to their cells.The prison team wore plain gray base-ball uniforms marked with letter “O. P.” In the press box sat an inmate reporter for the Ohio Penitentiary News, a paper printed at the penitentiary.Pitching for the team was Charlie Scott, a Springfield “pitcher”. A dozen buckshot imbedded in the flesh of his pitching arm apparently had not effected his “whip.” Eight men were fooled by his curves.Alfred Alexander of Xenia proved efficient and was the heavy hitter for his team throughout the game, but his batting eye failed him in the ninth. As he came to bat with an opportunity to win the game, the prison band and rooters started a parody entitled “Alexander’s Ragtime Slam.”  Alexander shuffled his feet, waved his bat and fanned. The proceeds of the game will go to charity.</p>
