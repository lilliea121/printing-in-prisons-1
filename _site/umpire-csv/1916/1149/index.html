<p>YOU WILL BE GLAD When the years have skipped by and memory runs back over the path you have trod, you will be glad you stopped to speak to every inmate friend you met, and left them with a warmer feeling in their hearts because you did so you will be glad that you were happy when doing small, every day things through prison life, and that you served the you could prison life’s lowly round. You will be glad that the Warden had said all through your bit “I know I can trust him; He is going to make good.” You will be glad there have rainy days in your prison life. If there were no storms the fountain would dry up, the sky would be filled with poisonous vapors, and prison life would cease. You will be glad that you shut your ears tight against evil things inmates said about one another, and tried the best you could to stay the words winged the poison. You will be glad you brought smiles to the Overseers and no sorrow. You will be glad you have met all the hard things which have come to you while here, with a hearty handshake, never dodging out of them, that you made good your parole and now live out in the World a “Man among Men.—B 6861</p>
