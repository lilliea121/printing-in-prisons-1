This applies to waiters, porters and others, the special committee decided today at a conference to determine what constitutes a daily and a weekly wage. Wages paid for overtime work in seasonal employments will be included in the wage determination, it was decided. Tools or other materials furnished by the employer to be used by the employee may be deducted from the wages unless it is provided in the contract of employment that the employer shall furnish such materials and has the right to deduct the price from the wages. A seasonal employment is defined periodically suspended for periods of more than four weeks, because of conditions in a trade or industry.
