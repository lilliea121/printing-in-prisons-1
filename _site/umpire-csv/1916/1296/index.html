<p>“THE TURNING POINT”At some period in life each person had to decide what kind a life they will lead. If a man decides for the wrong his life will be dark and unhappy; should he decide for the right his life will be bright and cheerful. His deciding what path he will follow is called his turning point.Nearly every man confined within the walls of this institution today, decided before the committing of their crimes which way he would travel through life. Hence our confinement here. We chose the wrong way and fell like every one else was decided like usBut any of us here today or elsewhere can have another turning point, (unless you have already turning point, (unless you have already decided for the good I advise you not to turn again) if we desire the good things of life and the reward that comes after is earned honestly.How can we have this turning point? By deciding right here and right now, to be honest, faithful, and true and by obeying the word of our master and the laws of society, you have reached the turning point for the right. And as soon as you have done this you shall reap your reward. Shall we make a turning point today?B 8140—</p>
