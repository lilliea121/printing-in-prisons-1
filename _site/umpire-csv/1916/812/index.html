<p>FORD ENABLES PARDONED MAN TO ERECT $10,000 HOME A late report from Detroit, Mich., states that the Ford system has enabled Samuel D. Haynes, a pardoned life prisoner, to erect a three story brick flat on Pilgrim avenue in that city. Behind the simple announcement lies one of the strangest stories of criminology ever written. This particular house is the realization of a dream that came to Haynes in a small ill ventilated cell in the State Prison at Thomaston, Me., where he spent 39 years of his life. Then his eighth petition for a pardon from a life sentence was granted. Henry Ford has demonstrated that modern and humane treatment accorded men who show a sincere desire to reform and lead an upright life, is an undisputed success. The attention of Mr. Ford was drawn to Haynes in July 1914, when he was released from Rockland, Me., prison. The case of Haynes, who is now one of “Ford's boys,” is but one of many whom the “Motor King” has placed in a position of trust. Given the chance to redeem himself, for which he had prayed, Haynes has proved that the trust was not misplaced.</p>
