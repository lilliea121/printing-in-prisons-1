He was then replaced by Mac who walked the first three men facing him and Jordan cleaned the bases by making one of his costomery home runs, giving his team the lead 5 to 3. Hagy came back with a home run in the same inning tieing the score; which remained a tie until the 8th inning, when the Black Demons, by heavy hitting scored 2 more runs which won the game. Slim pitching for the Black Demons had 4 strike outs and allowed 4 hits. Mac for the All Stars struck out 5 and allowed 7 hits R.
