<h1>Be A Man</h1>

<p>BE A MANBy W. Dayton WegeforthIt’s a mighty good thing, while you’re running life’s race,Just to pause, as you go, and to come face to faceWith your conscience, and ask it a question, or two;For it’s right you should know what your life means to you.Have you done things worth while, have you drifted along, Have you filled it with sighs, have you filled it with song,Have you helped when you should, have you tried to do right,Have you struggled for good, or just fought for might?Have you given your hand to some fellow in need,Have you sneered at the man who was not of your creed,Have you been open-hearted and ready to do,Have you tried to be just, have you tried to be true?In your judgement of men, have you been always fair,Have you learned to forgive in the face of despair,Have you fought against greed, or succumbed to its lust,Have you learned what it means to protect and to trust?Oh. it’s easy to preach and it’s easy to tellOf the other chap’s faults—but our own faults, ah, well!We are cowards at times, and the truth, you will find, Is a thing we dislike, for it’s rather unkind.But the Past, let it rest. Give a thought TodayAnd Tomorrow, as well, for the Time’s growing gray;Do the things that you should do the best that you can,Crown your life with your deeds—be a red-blooded man!</p>
