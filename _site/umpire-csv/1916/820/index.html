<h1>Separate Prisons From Politics</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>SEPARATE PRISONS FROM POLITICS One of our local papers that has championed the cause of Ex-Warden Osborne from time to time, makes the following editorial comment in its columns. “Whatever may be the merits or defects of the kind of prison management instituted at Sing Sing by Mr. Osborne, it is plain that it could never have a fair show while the Superintendent of State Prisons was so obviously determined it should be a failure Mr. Riley’s interference with Mr. Osborne in matters of discipline was dangerous from the first Now that he has shown his purpose to continue it with the new warden it was very clearly the duty of Governor Whitman to intervene, Having refused to resign, the Superintendent now has to face the prospect of removal on specific charges. Probably his fight for retention will be of no benefit to him. But if the hearings bring out the essential facts in the situation, reveal the baseness of the political intrigues which have disgraced the whole system of prison management in New York, and awaken public opinion to the necessity of earnest support for the work of reform, they will be worthwhile.”</p>
