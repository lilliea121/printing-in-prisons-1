<h1>Let This Statute Be Applied</h1>

<p>LET THIS STATUTE BE APPLIED It is pleasing to note the interest that is being manifested in the welfare and uplift of the convicted man by the influential press of the country, which is indicative of a decided change in Societies attitude toward the law breaker. That this will eventually result in much good for all concerned, may be taken for granted. In a recent issue of the Saturday Evening Post, we read: “A Pennsylvania statute provides that when a person is convicted of any crime, except a few which necessarily involve gross moral turpitude, and it appears that he has not before been convicted of crime, then the court may take into consideration the defendant’s character and all the collateral circumstances of the case—for example, whether he has been generally industrious or a_ loafer; whether he bears a reputation for common honesty or the reverse; how well he has discharged his obligations to his family or other dependents; what his motive was in committing the crime. And if it appears “that he or she is not likely again to engage in offensive conduct, and that the public good does not require that the defendant should suffer the penalty imposed by law,” the court may suspend the sentence and place the defendant on probation, on such terms as it deems proper. This is an intelligent law, and we are glad to note it in the Keystone State, which, by and large, probably has as many civic virtues as any other member of the Union.”etc.— We heartily agree with the writer about the “civic virtues”—ahem!—and all the other nice things that can be said of Pennsylvania, but we do wish the writer of the quoted article had mentioned the name or names of some of the judges who have taken advantage of the statute mentioned in the dispensation of justice. In the large number of cases which come before the court, surely there must be some that are worthy of the special consideration of the trial judge. If the Saturday Evening Post will please publish the names of the judges who apply the aforementioned statute in their decrees, we will be only too glad to reprint the same in bold type at the head of our columns.</p>
