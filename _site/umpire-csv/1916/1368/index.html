<h1>Tremendous Activity At Steel Plants</h1>

<p>TREMENDOUS ACTIVITY AT STEEL PLANTSUsual Summer Shutdown Will be Abandoned on Account of the Heavy DemandsReports from Pittsburgh show the tremendous activity of the iron and steel plants throughout the state. At no previous time has the demand for iron and steel been so continuous as at present. For the first time in the history of the steel trade the mills and foundryâ€™s have such heavy orders on hand that it will be necessary to continue work without the usual summer stop.In the tin-plate trade, as an instance, it is the custom to close about the first of July for repairs and changes, but this year the mills have greater tonnage in orders on hand than ever before, and there will be absolutely no suspensions that are not forced by necessity. The Carnegie Steel Company has on its books orders that will keep all its rail mills fully employed through the third quarter of 1917, and has on hand specifications for the major portion of this tonnage. As general thing the structural steel trade is rather quiet at this time of the year, mainly because of the high prices, but so far as the mills are concerned, the demand for ship building and car building on the shape mills is providing them with a very great amount of work.At present time mills are sold up on practically all kinds of finished material to the end of the year, and in some cases well into next.</p>
