<p>DO YOU KNOW THAT—? Philadelphia was our first capitol. In Philadelphia was melted the first pig iron. Our Federal Constitution was written in the State House. Our Nation actually began at Indepandence Hall, in this town. The Stars and Stirpes came into existence at the Betsy Ross’ house on Arch street. The first screw propeller attached to any warship, was made and fitted in this city. The Bank of North America was the first bank established on this continent. It is said that the first bridge in this country was built across the Schuykill at Philadelphia. One of the professors of the University of Pennsylvania, made the first moving picthures at that institution. Philadelphias beautiful new Art Gallery is now building upon America’s first city water works site. Thomas Fitch navigated a steam vessel in the waters about Philadelphia before Robert Fulton ran his steamer up the Hudson.</p>
