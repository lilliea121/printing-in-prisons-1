<h1>The Test of Character</h1>

<p>THE TEST OF CHARACTER It was a noted writer who said that “one of the greatest tests of character was to be deprived of the credit that is due.” When one performs a good deed there are often those who will rise up to claim the credit of the origin of the idea, or its enactment, or both, for themselves. They make no hesitation to thrust the modest originator into the background with the hope that he may be forgotten or ignored, depending upon their own nerve, or seeming standing to carry off the honors. But if we look about us we will see that the most admirable creatures that really help to brighten the lives of others less fortunate than themselves, are usually those who go quietly to work for the help and benefit of their fellowman, indifferent of the ascription of the praise. Unfortunately there are some who will not make an effort in any undertaking until they may feel assured that their own name in it will be well heralded about, that they may thus add to their own prestige. In fact, the selfish minded persons must see their own cards attached to the performance of an act, and they try to impress you with their importance and influence. In this day of advancement and hustle there is not always time to thank another for some trifling service, though at heart you may indeed feel very grateful for a little lift over “stony places.” But our praise loving man has felt slighted because he has not been duly thanked. What a great pity it is that we cannot be contented to take appreciation for granted, and let it go at that. It frequently happens—or it should, if the case warrants—that you may go out of your way to do someone a good turn, and when you have done it there comes no immediate return for your friendly act. Yet there is always the thought that you have done for another as you would like to have them do unto you, which is really the right spirit. Those who seek the noisy heraldry are those to whom the thoughtful most reluctantly concede it. The ones whose golden opinions are worth winning are disgusted with a man’s proclamation of his own merit. Never was an ego so small as in these days when myriads of the noblest pass through the fire to Moloch. What room is there for the pride of life and the vanity of human wishes? The self-assessed great ones never seemed so mean and trivial as in the vivid light from the battlefires. How little noise the soldier spirits made as they marched to their immolation! They were drowned out by the self-sekers—but the ages to come will take account of them, because they did not seek their own. Sincere men are stirred most by the unconscious heroisms. The hero is as great _ in solitude as when he is laureled and acclaimed. They do not court popularity and invite esteem. They put the work far ahead of the workman, and magnify the deed, not the doer. Those who demand that we pause every little while to notice them are tiresome and obstructive. They have not outgrown the childishness that calls insistently for admiring attention to every little achievement. When Solomon found that all was vanity, perhaps he was exasperated by a mighty host about him clamorous for the credit of everything that glorified his reign, but if so, he never showed it.</p>
