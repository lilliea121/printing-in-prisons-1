<p>HONOR CLUB NOTES The Second Section of the H. F. C., numbering approximately about seven hundred men, enjoyed their afternoon outing on Saturday last, with a parade and ball game. With V. President, A 8432. as Chief Marshal the line of formation was the same as on former occasions. Innovations worthy of mention were the large American flag carried by the Fifth Gallery and a unique and comic representation of an Ambulance Corps by B 6936 who, with a wheelbarrow draped with flags, and bearing a red cross, brought up the rear of the procession. A word of praise and thanks must be given Prof. Wiegandt and the E.S. P. band for the excellent music rendered on these occasions. The game was a good one and the former 14 inning tie was played off resulting in another victory for the H. F.C. team by a score of 5 to1. Mackon the mound for the H. F. C. had them all going from start to finish. The game was played by three o’clock and President Rube C. McKenty, desiring to give the boys all the time out in the air and sunshine possible, picked out a nine from among the members for a “scrub” game; this proved a comedy, but was nevertheless enjoyed, some new stunts in baseball being pulled off. The sound of the bugle ended the game after a few innings had been played, and the boys returned to their cells pleased and happy. Good order prevailed during the entire afternoon, and the members are to be congratulated on, and for, their good conduct. Keep it up boys and you will not regret it. The V. President, A 8432, requests the members, in future, to refrain from smoking while on parade, as it does not look good to see the boys in line smoking their pipes and cigarettes, and surely anyone can forego this habit for this short time, and he also suggests that as the line passes the front entrance that the boys lift their hats out of politeness and respect for Officials and visitors that may be present. The attention of the club members, and to new arrivals especially, is called to the advantages of the Club Library, the best and latest magazines and periodicals may be enjoyed for a trifling sum, the Librarian makes a round of the entire institution daily, and any one desiring to enroll or to secure any information relative to this matter may consult him or if you cannot see him, notify your delegate who will report your number to him and he will arrange to see you. The following blocks and galleries will exercise this Saturday afternoon, June 10, as follows: 1 B, 8 B, 6 B, 6 G, 12 B, 12 B-1 G, 12 B-2 G, 11 B and 10 B. Remember all rules governing games etc., and do not violate any of them. The H F Club kindly loaned their piano to the St. John’s Asylum Boys for their entertainment on the Center last Sunday. Rep. Del. B 7819, 5602.</p>
