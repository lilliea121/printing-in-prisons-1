<p>WAGES FOR STEEL WORKERS HIGHEST EVER PAID The Steel Corporationâ€™s announcement of a general wage advance, to take effect February 1, amounting to more than 10 per cent. for common labor, was followed by similar advances by independent companies, these for the most part being made effective January 1. Merchant blast furnaces took like action, so that within a few days virtually the entire industry stepped up to the highest level of wages it has ever paid. The next great adjustment will be that in coal mining, which has never been of more importance to the iron trade than in this year of unexpected strain on every link in the chain of production and transportation. Usually quiet in the first half of January, the domestic steel trade has shown this month that price advances have not reached their limit and that export demand will be a factor in establishing higher levels. At Pittsburgh contracts amounting to 140,000 tons of barb wire for war use are offered, but mills there cannot make the deliveries asked. In bars for shells, also, limitations on the buying by France and England will be those imposed by. mill conditions here.</p>
