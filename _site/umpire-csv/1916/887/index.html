<p>PLANS FOR GREATEST RESEARCH SHOPS IN WORLD Improved Machinery Will Do Work in Few Hours That Formerly Took Weeks In claimed that the U. S. Navy possesses the most effective torpedo in the world, and an aeroplane engine that is said to represent the very last word in engine construction of that kind is a promise of the near future, and plans and specifications have been made for the greatest research laboratory in the world, where work that now takes months to accomplish can be finished in as many days. This interesting announcement was made at a meeting of the Naval Consulting Board, held in the New York Navy Yard recently. It was the most important meeting that the board has yet held, and among the official documents submitted to its members for their study and instruction were the correct designs of some ‘of the: latest and powerful warcraft in the navies of the warring Powers of Europe. How these plans came into the possession of the board was one of the many secrets that the members refused to divulge. It was admitted that the foreign plans showed many improvements in. warship construction and armament that up to a short time ago were mysterious so far as the American navy was concerned. Plans recently approved by the President and worked out by a committee of the board for the mobilization of the industries of the country, were explained by Howard E: Coffin, the inventor, while Mr. Edison submitted the final and complete plans and specifications for the great laboratory and experiment station, which it was unanimously voted to commend to the favorable attention of Congress. The plans for the proposed laboratory and experiment station were submitted: by Mr. Edison, and were declared perfect in every detail, as it was possible to make them. They call for a series of 23 splendid buildings, and in each and every: one of them every inch of space is accounted for. Even the machines, the tools and other equipment are provided for in the plans. The blue prints numbered more than 100 and were each a yard square. The principal buildings provided for in the scheme are the administration, the chemical and physical laboratory, the machine shop, the erecting shop, the forge building, the foundry, the pattern and carpenter building, the sheet metal shop and the powerhouse. The buildings range in height from two to four stories. The preliminary cost fur the proposed experimental station Mr. Edison placed at $1,500,000. When completed ‘in-all details the final cost will be between $4,000,000 and $5, 000, 000. Mr. Edison is quoted as saying that “in the course of a conversation with an admiral of our navy, the officer told me about a certain style of gun carriage he wanted built. It required a vear to build that carriage, he said. From the description he made to me I believe we could build such a carriage in the laboratory we have proposed in about 72 hours.”</p>
