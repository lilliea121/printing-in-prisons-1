<p>36,000 EMPLOYES TO GET WAGES INCREASED In a report from South Bethlehem, it is learned that twenty-four thousand employes on the payroll of the Bethlehem Steel Company, were made glad lately by the announcement of a voluntary increase in wages of 10 per cent., which will become effective on May 1. The increase will mean the adding of $170,000 per month to the payroll, which last month was $1,700,000. This is a third voluntary increase, each approximating 10 percent. raise in less than a year. The increase also affects the 7000 employes of the Pennsylvania Steel Company, at Steelton, Pa., and 5000 at the Maryland Steel Companyâ€™s plant at Sparrows Point, near Baltimore, where there is also a shipyard. These two companies were recently purchased by Mr. Schwab.</p>
