<h1>The Big Leaguers</h1>

<p>THE BIG LEAGUERS It is not safe to predict the winner of any game of baseball, but judging by the results of the past week, it seems almost certain that the pennants of the American, and National Leagues will fly from the staffs of the Athletics and New York Giants this year. The latter have a lead over the Phillies that cannot be overcome unless the Giants should stop playing entirely, and the Athletics are by no means out of the woods. They have the advantage, however, of a long season on their own grounds before the wind-up, so that everything points their way. If they do win out, then for the third time they will meet the Giants in a series of games for the Worldâ€™s championship, and they will unquestionably prove to be of a class worthy of a place in the history of the country. Manager Dooin, of the Phillies, has not yet given up hopes of overtaking the Giants, and last week consummated deals which have materially strengthened his team. Some changes were necessary for the Phillies have suffered a slump recently which it will be almost impossible for them to overcome. Their recent showing against Chicago and Pittsburg was particularly poor. All managers in both Leagues are already recruiting their forces for next year and the trading promises to be brisk throughout the season.</p>
