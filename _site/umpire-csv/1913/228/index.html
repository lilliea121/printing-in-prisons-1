<p>CUBS vs STOCKING SHED June 9. Very uneventful was the game played today between the above teams, and it ended in a win for the Cubs, 7-1. Everybody seemed to be in a state of lethargy, and indifferent to which way the ball went. Ducky who has been pitching so consistently of late is being overworked, and to that we attribute his poor pitching today. He was off the bull’s eye and let many men occupy bases on balls. We have seen Tommy pitch better, and we must attach the same reason to his handling of the sphere The Cubs in the 2nd inning opened the scoring with Tommy hitting a two bagger, stole 3rd, and scoring on an error. Butt was walked, stole 2nd and 3rd and scored on Stew’s sacrifice. Marty got to 3rd and faded. In 3rd inning they bunched a quantity of runs and thus settled the Shed’s hash. Charley passed, stole 2nd and 3rd and scored on Tommie’s two-bagger obtained by a wild throw; Tommie stole 3rd and scored on Butts double, as did Jor who had secured his base on halls. Butt scored on Woody’s 2 bagger who faded at 3rd. After this nothing noteworthy happened. — Henry.</p>
