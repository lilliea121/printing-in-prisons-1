<p>AFTER DINNER CHAT In the absence of real brown turkey, the UMPIRE is presented today in “turkey-brown.” 14 dead, 175 injured is the total football casualties to date this season. 12,000 dozen of eggs “made in Germany,” arrived in Philadelphia last week, and knocked the price of this is delightful product of the native hen down to forty cents per dozen. Eggs can be shipped from Germany to this city in about the same time as required by freight from Kansas, ten days. Our foreign friends appear to be losing their grip at Harrisburg. Of the 17 pardons granted by the Board last week, there was only one to a foreigner. The ratio has usually been the other way around. The Salvation Army has another windfall. Mary Jane Fowler, of Liverpool has bequeathed $450,000 to the English cause. This occurred in Delaware, the State which advocates and practices the flogging of convicts: James King, employed by the ‘‘People’s Railway Company of Wilmington, as a conductor, found a wallet containing $700, and as a reward received a twenty-five cent piece, which he is going to frame as a reminder that “honesty is the best policy.”A genuine “turkey trot’ parade took place in Cuero, Texas, last week, when 6,000 live turkeys, preceded by the Governor of the state stalked through the streets in droves of a hundred each, behind trained leaders. One giant bronze gobbler drew a baby carriage with a small child passenger, and both appeared to rather enjoy it. There are lots of people having dead loads of fun with criminals these days. I thought the limit had been reached, when they began to send them to the operating tables, but not so. It appears that the New Jersey Legislature passed a law in 1911 providing that convicts, among some others, should be STERILIZED. “Watcher know bout that?” Yes it is true, but the Supreme Court has just set the act aside as unconstitutional. The World-touring baseball players of the two big leagues have at last started on their long trip. The first stop will be in Yokahama, where they will be pitted against some of “Japan’s best.” Including the managers, players, press representatives and others, there are 67 persons in the party. Prison industrial farms are being everywhere urged as the crying need of the convict. After it becomes general, and we have all become fat and sleek through the wholesome effects of the simple life, along will come the Farmer, and demand its abolishment, as interfering with the profits of the honest tiller of the soil. And why shouldn’t he? If two and one-third millions of mechanics, can secure legislation against convict labor, why shouldn’t the farmers, who outnumber the mechanics four to one, secure equal protection? Governor Tener will be the next president of the National Baseball, to succeed Thomas Lynch the present incumbent. The tender of the office was unanimous, and will be confirmed by election next month. The term of office will be four years, at a salary said to be in excess of $10,000 per year. The decision meets with widespread approval of business and baseball men. During an address the other night, Connie Mack said that he would welcome the time when a major league captured a world’s series in four games. He said, he supposed that people would continue to believe that the outcome of a series was fixed, or an agreement as to the number of games to be played reached in advance, but as a matter of fact, there was no sport so honest as baseball. “Gunboat” Smith now claims the world’s heavyweight championship as a result of his victory over Sam Langford, the demon of the prize ring. whom he bested after twelve rounds of grueling battle, one night last week, in Boston. Jack Johnson was matched last week to fight Frank Moran in the second week of January in Paris, for the heavyweight championship of the world. Johnson is willing to fight Moran in defense of his title on account of the recent action of the International Boxing Union in declaring the heavyweight title vacant. His manager denies that Johnson’s reentrance into the ring is owing to his being “broke.” The whipping post in Delaware does not seem to act as a deterrent from crime among the natives, at least. Only a few weeks ago a “crime wave” struck Wilmington with so much force that the citizens were compelled to organize possess to patrol the streets at nights. Someone suggests that the reason professional yeggmen give the statewide berth, is because there is nothing worth stealing in the beautiful state of mellow peaches. One man asks the Umpire to name those constituents of beef which render it so important as an article of food. Give it up, and pass the query along to the Medical department. Another one wants to know what will prevent falling out of hair? This is also passed up to the Medical department, as worthy of attention, It seems to be a condition affecting almost everyone here, both young and old; those confined entirely to their cells as well as those employed elsewhere. Some simple remedy will be eagerly received and printed in these columns for the benefit of those who need it. Everybody is taking a whack at us as the season approaches, when it was said, “Peace on Earth, good will to men,” or was it to all “good” men? I’ve forgotten, The newspapers, police and even some lawyers are adding their little knock, but the unkindest cut of all comes from Mr. C. Stuart Patterson, at one time Inspector of this institution. He is reported to have said, that he had seen prisoners at the expiration of a six years sentence, go out and commit the very same sort of crime and come back to Cherry Hill in three months, “Whipping is the only way to keep such men out of prison,” is the remark attributed to him. I don't agree with him. If the activities of the police were only curtailed toa greater extent than at present, we might all stay out of jail, without the necessity for a spanking. Strange how some people twist things around. —Mitch</p>
