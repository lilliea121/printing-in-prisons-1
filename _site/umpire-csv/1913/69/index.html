<p>Why don’t the base umpires follow up the plays? Don’t stand in one position like a statue; go with the ball, If a man is on second, get over alongside of second base, that’s where the play will he made. When he starts for third, follow him up, and he at the bag when the play is made. Some of the pitchers are complaining. of Denver Eddie’s bald head ; they want. him to keep it covered up, When he has his hat off ,they think his head is the home plate, consequently the ball is high and the batter walks. Big Jack, in the Boiler House, offers to wash Rabbi's top shirt for two months, if any pitcher in the League can strike him out—no one is interested enough, Jack, to cave whether Rabbi's shirt is washed or not; least of all, the Rabbi himself, last week, Teams visiting the new Ebbet’s Park in Brooklyn, complain that wheat is sprouting up all over left field, which interferes with their batting.The manager of the Library says Ban has not struck his gait as yet --well, we don’t know about that; he only pitched one game and won that. If there is anything else Ban can do, let us know, Poet.Chee Chaw is still a hold-out.Little Bobbie of the Ninth has come to a satisfactory agreement with Timmy and put his John Hancock to a contract last week.If we had strived as hard for a good record outside, as we do for one in baseball in here, what a change there would have been in our lives.No, Josh; the fact that you are playing good ball on one of the teams here will not aid you in Harrisburg in seeking executive clemency.Mr. Sullivan has written tot he UMPIRE in regard to a possibility of a franchise for his boys in the Wash House. They ought to play pretty clean ball.The Orchestra gave the regular concert on Sixth Block Saturday night. An interesting number was the Quartette, which rendered some popular songs, assisted by Henry, the piano artist. Another good number was that “Anvil Chorus” medley. Come again Joe. --EddieThe Poet of the Library has assigned Mike, the short stop to watch all the games the Ninth plays with the Cubs --must be getting nervous, eh, Poet?We are glad to hear that Big Whitey has secured a berth with the Library through the columns of the UMPIRE, notwithstanding the fact, that he has failed so far to acknowledge the courtesty that was extended to thim.Mr. EditorHow can a “Long” “foul” “Wade” through “Water” be grabbed outside of a sack by a “Slick” catch, and not “Burnblack” after being sizzled off the “stick???”Note- if you don’t know, ask some of the Ninth Block Baseball Team.The Band dropped quite a few notes in that game with the Plasterers last week. We guess it was because they had no score to play from --the Plasterers having 13 runs and the Band 0.</p>
