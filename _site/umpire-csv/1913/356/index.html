<h1>Cubs Toy With Ducklings</h1>

<p>CUBS TOY WITH DUCKLINGS Blink, one of Duckey’s new men, took a heave at the first ball pitched, this afternoon, banged it somewhere near the Second block or further, and then seemed surprised when someone told him to run. He started a little late, but easily made the circuit, scoring the first run for the Shed. In the fifth inning, the same man made another tally, and Spetz, who had been walked, was sent home by John’s hit. The Cubs simply toyed with the Ducklings, scoring in each of the five innings for a total] of ten runs. Rabbi was knocked out of the box in the first two innings, when six of the Cub’s runs were made, and Spetz was put in for the rest of the session. The Shed used twelve men, but, the game they put up was so poor, as to be pathetic. They batted Herb pretty freely, but, good fielding on the part of the Cubs prevented run making. Score 10—3. Umpire, Jack. —Mitch.</p>
