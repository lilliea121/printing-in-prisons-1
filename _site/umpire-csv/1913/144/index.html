<h1>A Few Suggestions</h1>

<p>A FEW SUGGESTIONS — To the managers of the Ninth, Library and Plasterers :— Would it not make the following games more interesting to the spectators, and you also, if, first, you allow only _ three subs to each team; second, you allow the others to sign elsewhere, thereby making the other teams more your equal in the contest ? In doing this, you are not only strengthening the other teams, but bringing your own to a higher state of efficiency, and this for the sake of sport. Some of you may have ten or more subs, which looks bad. Knowing as we do, the restricted conditions under which we labor in procuring recruits, it takes no weather prophet to see there is little in store for the small teams, unless you lighten up, in regard to subs. There are only three teams in the running at present for the pennant, namely: the Ninth, Library and Plasterers, with the advantage slightly with the Ninth. Tis true that the Turtle won in the race with the Rabbit, but that was an exception to the rule. WE are not Turtles. Some of that serum might be alright.— Ye Olde Junk Man.</p>
