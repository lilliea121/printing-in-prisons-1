<p>WELL MATCHED TEAMS STRIVING FOR LEAGUE HONORS THIS WEEK Plasterers Lose First of Series to Ninth— Shed Plays Spirited Game With Band—Cubs Crawling UpSHED vs BAND The Shed and Band ran neck and neck up to the sixth inning, in their game of Monday last, when the latter got a lead of one run, and in the next, obtained three hits and four runs, one of which was a homer, by Louie. The Rabbi pitched bang-up baseball for the Shed, striking out nine, and allowing six hits. Little Ike, who was in the box for the Band, proved a puzzle to the Ducklings, who only succeeded in securing three hits. Only twenty-four Shedites faced the little twirler in the seven innings, which was holding them down some. Blink and Spetz, two lightweights, tallied the brace of runs secured by Duckie’s men. The Band scored through Baldy, Poet (2) Louie (2) Dave and Rodge. In the second inning, Slim, of the Band, hit and fell asleep at first, where he was awakened by Rodge, the next baiter, just in time to be tagged. Score 7—2. Umpires, Jack and Schmitty. — Mitch.</p>
