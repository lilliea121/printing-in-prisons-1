<h2>My Lord and IBy Robert Davis &quot;I worked for men,&quot; my Lord will say When we meet at the end of the King's Highway,'I walked with the beggar along the road, I kissed the bondsman stung by the goad,I bore my half of the porter's load. And what did you?&quot; my Lord will say,'As you traveled along the King's Highway?&quot;&quot;I made life sweet,&quot; my Lord will say&quot;When we meet at the end of the King's Highway, &quot;I smoothed the path where the thorns annoy,I gave the mother back her boy, I mended the children's broken toy,And what did you?&quot; my Lord will say,&quot;As you traveled along the King's Highway.&quot;&quot;I showed men God,&quot; my Lord will say, &quot;As I traveled along the King's Highway,I eased the sister's troubled mind; I helped the blighted to be resigned ;I showed the sky to the souls grown blind, And what did you-?&quot; my Lord will say,when we meet at the end of the King's Highway.</h2>
