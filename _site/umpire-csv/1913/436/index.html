<p>PLASTERERS WIN EASILY. Handsome Jack, the ginger cake maker, and one of the Duckling’s castoffs, stepped up daintily to the plate, in the first inning of the game between the Plasterers and the Ninth this afternoon, when there were three men on the bases and whacked the ball straight up the road to where Bill should have been to the Stocking Shed, driving in three runs and completing the circuit himself. Prior to this little play, Stump and Barber had each scored, so that the husky Plasterers rested easy with six good big runs as a starter. In the fourth, this same Jack sent Andy home and got there himself on a passed ball, while in the fifth, Felix drove one over the sixth block for three bags, eventually reaching the plate, while Augie who had been sent to first also tallied in this inning. For the Ninth, Cap scored in the second, and Chef and Lefty each tallied one in the third inning, which was the l wind-up of the run getting for the leaders. Cap made a desperate attempt to reach home in the fourth, but was tagged at the plate. In the fifth, Bill fell into a clever trap set for him by Tony, and was caught at second. Only eighteen men in five innings faced Yaller, who was in the box for the Plasterers, and of these, he struck out seven. The mighty Rube never touched him, fanning both times up. Twenty-six Plasterers faced Big Jack, the Ninth’s twirler, and touched him up for eight hits and a total of ten runs. The game was remarkable for the fact, that not once was the decisions of the umpire questioned. Score 10—3. Umpire Mack. —Mitch.</p>
