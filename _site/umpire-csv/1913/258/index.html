<h1>A Man and Work</h1>

<img width="200" src="/assets/img/" />
<p>A MAN AND WORK Work is action guided by poise and purpose Action accomplishes, performs. Deity creates through man. Nobility manifests itself in action; and what the man is, is revealed in what he does. The Master Man always and forever is a workingman. It is work that has tempered and tamed him. And out of the fulness of his strength he guides, directs, counsels—creates. That man is the greatest who best serves his kind. Sympathy and knowledge are for use—you acquire, that you may give out ; you accumulate, that you may bestow. And as God has given unto you the sublime blessings of sympathy and wisdom, there will come to you the wish to reveal your gratitude by giving them out again; for the wise man is aware that we retain only as we give. Let your light shine. To him that bath, shall be given. The exercise of wisdom brings wisdom. —Elbert Hubbard.</p>
