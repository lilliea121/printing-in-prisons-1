<p>WHO’S WHO In MacKentieville Who fires the coal and coals the fire, with vigorous strokes, and sullen ire? Who handles the great big iron poker, with the adept skill of a natural stoker? Who revels in ashes and mud and dirt, and uses the old tar barrel to wash his shirt? Who pitches a ball that fools the batter’s eye? Why that Hebrew gent-- that, wily Rabbi.</p>
