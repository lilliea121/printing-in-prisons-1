<h1>“Easy Payment” Fines</h1>

<p>“EASY PAYMENT” FINES” A police judge in Kansas City has perceived that it is not exact justice for one man to be allowed to go free merely because he has the money to pay his fine, while another who has no money goes to jail. Said he: “The rich men pay their fine and go, but the poor man is imprisoned, to labor at fifty cents a day until the amount of his fine is worked out; and that is nothing more than sending a man to jail for debt, a practice supposedly abolished long ago. As a remedy, the judge has inaugurated a system of installment fines for men of family and previous good record. The fine is recorded and the man is permitted to go about his own business on condition each week to the court, and take proper care of his family. Thus, the judge points out, the offender is compelled to work to keep out of prison, the public will not have to pay for his support, his family at not become charges on the community, and yet he will feel the sting of the law every time he makes a payment. A ruined boy is the logical result of a not fond and indulgent parent. “Some fellers go to the devil, because “they ain’t got nowhere else to go to.” that he pay a fixed amount of his wages.</p>
