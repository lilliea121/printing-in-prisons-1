<p>SHED OUT-CLASSED The Rabbi did the hardest work of his life on Thursday afternoon, when he went into the box for the Shed, and bravely tried to pitch his team to victory in the play-off of their tie game with the Ninth. During the seven innings. he was faced by 34 men to whom he served 173 balls, and who touched him up for five singles, three doubles, and two home runs; a total of twelve runs. The Shed could do nothing with Big Jack, until the fourth, when Fingers hit him for three bases, coming home on Frankie’s sacrifice. Blink also scored in this inning. In the sixth, Fingers who had singled, got home on Frankie’s hit right into big Jack’s eye. Timmy then went in for the Ninth, and of course, the Shed could do nothing with his erratic curves and the game was over, Score, 12—3. —Mitch.</p>
