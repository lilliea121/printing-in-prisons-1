<p>SPORTING NOTES The Gentlemen of the Third block met the Gentlemen of the Sixth block, last Saturday afternoon in a game of cricket on the Stablemont grounds, in which the former were defeated by the score, 1876 runs to 1598. A large and inquisitive crowd witnessed the contest, which for a long time was thought to be a variation of that exciting game, known as “Pussy-wants-a-corner.” The promoter of the proposed sets of tennis doubles, states that the organization is going along splendidly, with the exception of securing silk shirts, white duck trousers and shoes, without which no real game of tennis could be properly conducted.Failure to obtain the requisite number of ponies has caused a delay in forming the polo teams, talked about. Little Dutch has some wooden ones, but, they won't answer. Following the example of Mr. Blankenburg, Mayor of a little burg near Camden, the Mayor of MacKentieville has refused permission to hold automobile races within his precincts next October, or any other time.</p>
