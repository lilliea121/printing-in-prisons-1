<p>STUART PITCHES NO HIT GAME May 8The Stocking Shedlets woke up today, and ripped, tore, and banged the Cubs’ lineup for eight ‘‘yards.’? Three Cub pitchers essayed to stem the onslaught, but it was useless. In the first two innings Miller, Cub pitcher, passed five. In same innings, Jack and Big Slim, and Ames each hit; Floyd hit, also, and Ducky got a double. In fifth, Ames doubled. Stuart had two hits. Stuart pitched good ball, and was well supported by backstop and his field. Again Jack played brilliantly at third; a catch running backwards, equaled anything ever seen inside the walls. Eight runs, nine passes. Stuart passed four Cubs. My books show that the Cubs did not get a hit off of Stuart, (I may be mistaken.) One run for Cubs. A Texas leaguer, that described a beautiful parabolic curve, dropped into Herb’s hands and—dropped out again. Umpiring faultless. During this game, the Warden found occasion to stop a senseless, heated argument between two players. Don’t kill a good thing for nothing. When this old earth grow whiskers, there will be more fish in the sea. —Rocky.</p>
