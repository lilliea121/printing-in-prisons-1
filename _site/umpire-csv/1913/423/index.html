<p>LIBRARY SHUT OUT Ban went into the box for the Library, in its game with the Cubs this afternoon, and while he held them down to five hits and struck out seven men, his support was so bad that the Cubs had no difficulty in shutting his team out, to the tune of 6—0. The Library management has again shuffled the deck and succeeded in drawing little Julius, Joe, Slick, and Jimmie, but notwithstanding this added strength, could do nothing in the scoring line. Herb who was on the mound for the Cubs, allowed one double, and three singles, but only one man succeeded in reaching third. An indication of the fielding of the Library is shown in the statement, that of five men walked by Ban, three succeeded in reaching home. Jore’s playing at third, was easily the distinguishing feature of the game, as he accepted every chance, making several sensational catches, and hitting out a three bagger. Umpires, Jack and Schmity. —Mitch. Marty should not take the game so seriously. He has a good team in splendid working order, and he can afford to loosen up the tension once in a while.</p>
