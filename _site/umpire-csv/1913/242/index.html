<h1>Band Shut Out</h1>

<p>BAND SHUT OUT June 11. The above game was played to-day and from its inception, when we observed the Bandits line up, we were satisfied that the result was a foregone conclusion. Longy was in the box and pitched a good strong no run game, although we observed him hit three men. His support was good, and from the style in which they played, we are convinced they could have scored many more if they had been on their real mettle. Louis pitched a fair game for the Band, but he is no match for the Ninth sheet anchor. The game resulted in the Band being ‘‘Chicagoed,”’ which for those who are not acquainted with this vernacular, represents a shutout. Lefty and Longy scored home runs. The Poet singled but utterly ignored first base. It manifested gross carelessness, and it appeared to us as though he was indifferent about the issue of the game. Rodgie got to third and glued there; because in our opinion he had ample time to score on the Poet’s hit. John Henry made no secret of the fact, that he was terrified at Longie’s pitching, and at times almost turned his face to the wall. As we stated above, Longy had ten strike outs so probably herein hangs the sequel, which was Ninth 11 Band 0.</p>
