<p>THAT THE ENACTMENT of so many different measures in an effort to obtain a satisfactory parole law, would result in doubt as to proper interpretation of them by prison officials, is confirmed, by the recent request of the Warden of the Western Penitentiary, for an opinion on the matter by the Attorney General, found in the Public Ledger, in which he says: “In my judgment the commutation act of 1901 is not repealed by the indeterminate sentence act of 1911 or its supplement of 1913, and hence prisoners sentenced under the commutation act of 1901 have a right to claim credit for good behavior and release thereunder and may waive the benefit or privilege of parole under the later indeterminate sentence act of 1911 and its supplement of 1913.” He further states that a prisoner having been granted parole under the acts of 1911 and 1913 may not, while on parole, ask for a reduction of sentence under the commutation act of 1901. He says, “that in my opinion the parole act of 1911 and its supplement and the commutation act of 1901 are to be applied independently, and it was not the legislative intention that both acts should apply in any one case.”</p>
