<p>LIBRARY WIN FROM CUBS The sassy Cubs met the Librarians today for the final game of the week’s series and suffered Jingles’ rejuvenated worms to tie their tails up into eight big knots. They swatted that little cub Tommy, and the big bear cub Herb all over the field, notwithstanding the growls and scratchings of the seven other little cubs, until in the end, it was a very sorry looking lot of cubsies. Worm Josh was particularly active in annoying his play fellows, and had the satisfaction of tying the first knot. Ban, Charlie, Beef Trust, Slip and Louie, were other worms who each added kinks in the Cubs’ tails, which became very sore under this unusual treatment. However, Cub Charlie and fat cub, Jore managed to save the whole litter from being entirely shut out of the play for they catch managed to work in a knot on the Worms, before they were all tied up. Score 8—2 Umpires, Lippy, and Schmithy —Millsy.</p>
