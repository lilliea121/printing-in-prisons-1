<p>SOME HUBBARDISMS Talk less and listen more. Be gentle and keep your voice low. Live right up to your highest and best. It is a wise guy who does not monkey with his own destiny. Speak well of every one, if you speak of them at all—none of us is so very good. Noah was six hundred years old before he knew how to build an ark—don’t lose your grip, Folks who never do any more than they are paid for, never get paid for any more than they do. Troubles are not really troubles, unless you quit work and incubate them—-otherwise they are only incidental diversions. It is a greater disgrace to be sick than to be in the penitentiary. If you are in the pen, it is a sign that you have broken some man-made statute, but, if you are sick it is a sign that you have broken some God-made law. Your quarrel with the world is only a quarrel with yourself.</p>
