<p>BAND BEAT LIBRARIANS July 9 In the fifth inning of the game between the Band and Library this afternoon, every man of the Musicians took a s vat at Mike, Jingles latest pitcher, and when they got through, only one man had failed to hit the ball, and five runs were recorded to their credit. Slim also scored for them in the first, making six runs in all. The Librarians obtained two runs in the second inning through errors of Josh and Louie, but in no other inning did one of their men reach third. Yeap and Joe both tried it, but were caught. Louie and Mike the opposing pitchers each struck out five men. Umpires Lippy and Happy; poor unhappy Happy. Score 6â€”2. Mitch.</p>
