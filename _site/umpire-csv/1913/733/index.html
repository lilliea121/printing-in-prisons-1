<p>Doctor RUBNER, a celebrated professor and privy counselor of Germany has just published an interesting pamphlet embodying his views on the relative values of meats and vegetables as articles of food. Among other startling statements, he says that persons engaged in arduous brain work, or sedentary occupations require much larger quantities of nitrogenous and albuminous foods than workingmen, just as they require warmer rooms to work in. We must admit that this matter is a little beyond us, and respectfully refer it to the medical department. In this connection however, we wish to state that the job of editing a large and successful periodical like the Umpire entails arduous “brain work” of an enervating character, while it may it may also be classed as distinctly “sedentary.” Therefore. should the Doctor wish to undertake any experiments with a view of determining the accuracy of the German professor’s claims the Editor is perfectly willing to be immolated in the cause of science, and cheerfully offers himself as a subject for the test. He only stipulates that it may be soon, while there is yet enough of the subject left for experimental purposes.</p>
