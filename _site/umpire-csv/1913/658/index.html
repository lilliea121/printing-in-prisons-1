<p>FOLLOWING RIGHT after the many complaints of the enforcement of the parole law in this State comes the report that Governor Blease of South Carolina, has pardoned one man, and paroled 99 others, that they might rejoin their families on Thanksgiving Day. This makes a total of 882 men pardoned and paroled since the Governor went into office, and he promises to make the number an even 1000 at Christmas. His actions in this respect were conspicuous enough, one would think, but he has made them more so, in that he invariably favors the poor and unknown criminal, in preference to those of means and large acquaintance. The negroes, whom he professes to dislike so much, have fared better through his dispensations, than have the whites. And yet South Carolina still occupies her accustomed position on the Map.</p>
