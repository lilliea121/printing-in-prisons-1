<p>Library Shut OutJune 23. The Librarians under the new management of Jingles went down to inglorious defeat today at the hands of the Ninth by the score of 6—0. Charlie, a new arrival was put in the box for the Jinglers, and for four innings held the Ninth Block boys down to one hit, and that a clean home run by Longie. In the fifth, he walked the first two men when Chef attempted a sacrifice, and in making first, collided with Charlie who had fielded the ball. Both went down, and the Library man falling on his pitching arm and shoulder had to retire, though not until he had pitched one more ball to see if he was really out of the game. Reds was then put on the mound, and while there were no hits made off of him, was very wild and gave three men their bases; five runs being made in this inning. Bill for the Ninth pitched a perfect game, striking out eleven, of the sixteen men who faced him, and allowing only one man to reach second.
