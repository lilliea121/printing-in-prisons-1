<p>MotherCould we but realize beforehand the meaning the following lines convey, how much happier we could make mother’s life. It may be you have noticed a careworn look upon her face lately. Of course it has not been brought there by any act of yours; still it is your duty to chase it away. Would it not be a happy surprise to her if you should occasionally bid her sit down and rest while you performed the arduous duties in hand? And how a tender kiss will cause her dear face to brighten. Anyway you owe her a kiss or two. Away back, when you were a little bit of a girl she kissed you when no one else was tempted by your fever tainted breath and swollen face. You were not so attractive then as you are now. And through those years of childish sunshine and shadows, she was always ready to cure by the magic of mother’s kiss, your little dirty, chubby hands whenever they were injured in the first skirmishes with the rough old world. And then the midnight kiss with which she routed so many bad dreams as she leaned above your restless pillow, have all been on interest these long, long years. Of course she is not so pretty and kissable as you are; but if you had done your share of the work during the last ten years, the contrast would not be so marked. Her face has more wrinkles than yours, and yet if you were sick that face would appear far more beautiful than an angel's as it hovered over you watching every opportunity to minister to your comfort, and every one of these wrinkles seem to be bright wavelets of sunshine chasing each other over the dear face. She will leave you one of these days. These burdens, if not lifted from her shoulders, will break her down. Those rough, hard hands that haved one so many necessary things for you, will be crossed upon her lifeless breast. Those neglected lips that gave you your first baby kiss will be forever closed, and those sad, tired eyes will have opened on eternity, and then you will appreciate your mother; but it will be too late.</p>
