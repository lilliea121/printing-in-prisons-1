<p>Said To Be FunnyLet us be thankful for occasional visits from the man who sees the funny side of things. Had some of the men in this place worked as hard for a payroll when they had the opportunity, as they do for a parole here, things would be decidedly different.The Government is beating up the Egg and Butter Trust. That ought to make angel food but, it won't.While the principle ingredient of a chicken pie, is chicken, it does not necessarily follow that dog should enter into the make up of a dog biscuit.John had just returned from a fishing trip with a string of very small fish.&quot;Say, John,” remarked his wife. &quot;Don't fish go in schools?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot; replied John.“Then all I've got to say that you must have been fishing in the infant class.”- B 6491Keep your temper; nobody wants it.Dentist to Jingles : I guarantee to extract teeth without pain.Jingles to Dentist: Yes but I want the pain extracted. I'd rather keep the tooth.A young Sunday school teacher desiring to impress upon the minds of her class, the meaning of returning thanks, before a meal, asked the deacon’s son the following: “George what is the first thing your father says when he sits down to the table?”He says, “Go slow, with the butter kids, it's forty cents a pound,” replied George. -Jingles.</p>
