<h1>Library vs S. Shed: Stocking Shed Plays Under Very Difficult Circumstances</h1>

<p>LIBRARY vs S. SHED Stocking Shed Plays Under Very Difficult Circumstances The above teams bumped into one another today, and as has occurred many times before, the superiority of batteries told the tale. It is remarkable that such a dearth of pitchers continues, but we are fain to regard this exhibition as not the true state of affairs; in other words, we believe that there are twirlers of the horse hide in this institution, and if they were sought out a different complexion would de put upon some of the issues. It was pitiful to see the frightful mauling that was administered to the Stocking Shed, and poor Ducky and Stewart were absolutely nonplussed. Pitcher after pitcher was introduced, and batted clean out of the box, but the climax of their troubles came in the third and fourth innings, when a phenomenal bunch of hits and runs was made, amid mighty humping. At this stage of the game a dispute arose, and for a few minutes foreboded trouble. It appears that Andy was on third base, and the base umpire proclaimed him out, but the battery umpire immediately protested against his decision, and claimed the man safe, and was sustained. Now in order that all friction in the future may be avoided, it should be made known, and established by the commission, without the least possible delay, which of these two umpires is invested with supreme command when these ruptures arise, or if both should act independently of each other. Our representative, out of respect for the vanquished, quit before the game terminated, because he feared that by staying he would be compelled to ‘‘pile on the agony.’’ —Henry</p>
