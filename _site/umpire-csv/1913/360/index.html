<p>GAMES OF JULY 18 Ninth vs Band—Cubs vs Shed— Plasterers vs LibraryCUBS WALKOVER SHED The Stocking Shed completed their series with the Cubs today, suffering a very severe defeat, which was due to costly errors on their part. The game started off very well, and Duckey held his opponents to two runs, for the first four innings. His players then blew up and fumbled everything that came their way. The Cubs rallied in the fifth and four more men crossed the plate for them, and in the seventh landed two more across the home: plate. Tommy was on the slab for the Cubs, and although he did not pitch his best game of ball, managed to hold the Shed to one run, made by 6579, in the first inning, on one of Tommy’s complimentary trips to first. Duckey pitched masterly ball, but was lacking in the right stuff behind him. Blink pulled down two very difficult fly balls, back by the fifth block yards, for the Shed. John also made a very clever catch of a hot one that flew through Spetz’s hands. Butt made a sensational catch of a hot ball, bare hand from Rabbi’s bat. Julius had the best hit of the game, a clean two-bagger. Umpires, John Henry, Smithy. Score,8—1. Bill</p>
