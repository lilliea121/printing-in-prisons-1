<p>TREATMENT OF THE HAIR Medical Man Says Plenty of Air and Persistent Massage Will Overcome Baldness AS the Medical Department did not appear to be falling over itself in haste to reach the Umpire office with full instructions for the prevention of baldness, as it was hoped for, it placed this enterprising sheet in the position of old Mr. Mahomet and the mountain. Since the mountain would not come to him, then he must go to the mountain. So the Umpire man went to the mountain, and it was a mountain all right. However it was an affable mountain, bubbling over with wisdom ; generous with its use of Latin phrases, and eager to tell the afflicted readers of this paper just what to do to preserve the hair, and keep it from falling out. It did not venture upon a remedy for growing of hair, and any inquiries relating to this, must be referred to Jingles, who appears to have a solution. The loss of hair is due to several causes, the most common being, lack of air and sunshine, impoverished blood, and dandruff. The most frequent cause, is that of the existence of dandruff, and the first step necessary, is to get rid of that. Contrary to the general impression, dandruff is not a disease of the scalp, but is formed by a discharge from the glands, which hardens and forms a scale around the hair, shutting off the air so necessary for its life, and eventually killing it entirely. The treatment simply consists of softening this substance with Vaseline, or sweet oil and gently loosening the scale from the scalp, when it may be combed out, or washed out with pure soap and _ tepid water. Don’t use borax, ammonia, or any soaps strong with alkali. Ivory soap, is as free from alkalis any that can be bought. You won't get rid of the dandruff with one treatment,. It may require several, a dozen, but it must be gotten rid of. Then you are ready for the next step, looking toward the growth of new hairs to take the place of those you have lost, and positively the only effective treatment is that of continued and persistent massage. All so-called hair tonics contain irritants, designed to excite the circulation of blood, and this circulation can be obtained best by massage. Crude oil, and many of the petroleum products, like Vaseline, petrolatum, or even a little kerosine with the addition of one-third its weight of sweet oil may be applied to the scalp, not the hair, and the head gently massaged. At the same time, pull the hair gently until you succeed in getting rid of all the weak hair, which you would lose anyway, and which is better out first than last. As you progress, in the course of a few weeks the hair will be much stronger, and resist your efforts to pull it out, but keep up your massage just the same, and watch out for the appearance of dandruff, from which the scalp must at all times be free. If you wish, you can wash your hair every day with clear tepid water to which a little salt has been added. Not oftener than once a week, but every second week would be better, wash the hair with Ivory, or a good tar soap. Fire your cap away, and go bareheaded at all times. Don’t plaster your hair down on your head; fluff it up, so the air can blow through it. Bathe every time you have a chance, and eat whatever you can get your teeth on. In massaging the scalp use the tips of the fingers only, and go over the head firmly with a circular motion, without too much force; taking the scalp in sections as it were, until you have covered it all. Do this as often as you can. Get the habit of rubbing the more afflicted places while you are reading. Ina little while you will be doing this unconsciously, but the work, of keeping up a good circulation will be going, on, and before the baseball season comes around again, you will have a crop of hair that will make Mr. Paderewski’s top look like a football.</p>
