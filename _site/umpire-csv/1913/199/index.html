<p>Who is the quoit champion ? Break up games with the bat and not guff. Those Cubs are certainly playing some ball. Two straight from the Library, with prospects of another. Walter Johnson of the Washington’s has broken all records by pitching 56 consecutive no-hit innings. Someone asked Dave the cornet player how the Band Team was getting along. “Sh” said Dave, “Take off your hat when you speak of the dead.”The games scheduled for last Wednesday afternoon, were called off by the Weather man and will be played next Thursday instead. The Athletics took four games from the Yankees last week, and in order to allow Philadelphia business men to transact their business peacefully in New York, the Phillies dropped four to the Giants. Both Ty Cobb and Johnny Evers can afford to take a chance in rowdy ball playing, but there is not a player in the entire E. S. P. League who can do the same, and get away with it. ‘‘Don’t butt a stone wall.’’</p>
