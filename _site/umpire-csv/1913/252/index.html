<p>LIBRARY 6 BAND 4 June 12 A tie game was played off today between the above teams resulting in favor of the Library. Rich started twirling for the Bandits and was knocked all over the grounds for five runs in the first two innings after which Walt went in to finish. Eggie tried his hand in the box for the Students, and held them down until the third when Roge made a homer, bringing in Julius, who had made a three-bagger, and the Poet. Julius is a dependable little player worthy of a place in In the fourth, Dave walked and came home on the Poet’s hit. The feature of the game was the inability of Ban, of home run fame, to make. a hit. — Mitch Don’t let this hot weather affect you.</p>
