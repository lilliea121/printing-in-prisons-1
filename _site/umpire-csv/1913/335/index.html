<h1>The Two Bootblacks</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>THE TWO BOOTBLACKS (To be read fast.) Two bootblacks, one white and one black, were standing on a corner doing nothing, when the white bootblack agreed to black the black bootblack's boots. The black bootblack was willing to have his boots blacked by his fellow bootblack, and the bootblack who agreed to black the black bootblack’s boots went to work. When the bootblack blacked one of the black bootblack’s boots, the bootblack who agreed to black the black bootblack’s boots refused to black the other boot of the black bootblack unless the black bootblack, who consented to have the white bootblack black his boots, should add five cents to the amount the white bootblack made blacking other men’s boots. This the bootblack whose boots had been blacked refused to do, saying he didn’t care whether the boot that the bootblack hadn’t blacked was blacked or not. This made the bootblack who blacked the black bootblack’s boot angry as a bootblack often gets, and he spit upon the blacked boot of the black bootblack. This roused the passions of the black bootblack, and he proceeded to boot the white bootblack with the boot which the white bootblack who had refused to black the unblacked boot of the black bootblack, blacked the black bootblack’s visionary organ, and in which the black bootblack wore all the blacking off his blacked boot in booting the white bootblack. —Selected.</p>
