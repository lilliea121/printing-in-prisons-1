<h1>Good Bye Little Mary!</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>GOOD BYE LITTLE MARY! Dear, winsome, toddling little Mary is to have a real Christmas along with other little children after all, for on Monday next she will leave the only home she has ever known, to take a place in the large outside world. She will be just in time to have her name enrolled on Santa Clausâ€™ big book, along with those of all other good little kiddies, and perhaps, may even be able to obtain a glimpse of him. It is the wish of us all, that the same love and care which has been so generous y given to her while here, will accompany her, and serve to protect and provide for her throughout a long and happy life. Goodbye, little Mary. If there are any men contemplating playing Santa Claus to this dear little child, they may send their remembrances to the Chaplain who will see they are delivered before next Monday. It is quite natural to long for fame, in spite of the fact that fame makes it just that much harder to dodge our creditors. The devil rejoices more in one hypocrite than in ninety and nine genuine, Simon Pure sinners.</p>
