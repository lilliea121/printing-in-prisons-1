<h1>Why Did Brownie Quit?</h1>

<p>WHY DID BROWNIE QUIT? Beginning shortly, the readers of the Umpire will learn why Brownie, one of the clever carpenters employed by Mr. Gillespie, quit playing in the YaniganMutt game on Tuesday. If present plans with the Editor of the Umpire materialize, three chapters will be printed each week. He says his story will run for fifteen weeks, twelve .of which will be devoted as to what he thinks of Kel as a pitcher. Brownie played errorless ball, not having his hands on it once. At one time he was playing first base surrounded only by his whiskers, but Kel threw to him to catch a runner, and Brownie got mad, and told Kel never to throw anything at him again. He walked once and stole second, and was a foot away from third, when he evidently forgot something and went back to second for it. An elderly man, about 70 years of age, played third base for the Yanigans in a remarkable manner. The game was umpired by Tommy, of the Cubs, who between bites off of a sandwich, announced his decisions. A rooter for the Mutts claimed that the sandwich was given to the umpire by Quig, but this, a rooter of the Yanigans stoutly denied; insisting if the Kid hada sandwich he would eat it himself.â€” Tim.</p>
