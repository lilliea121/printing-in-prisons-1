<p>There is no desire to inflict unnecessary pain upon anyone through the publication of adverse criticism in these columns. At the same time, it must be borne in mind that the Umpire does not represent anyone man or set of men, but in performing its functions aims to be fair and acceptable to its entire number of readers. Therefore, it feels entirely justified in calling attention to, and bestowing censure upon anyone who threatens to curtail the amusements and privileges of our own little community and for the same reason will always be glad to give full credit and even glory to those who have rightly deserved it. It is in this connection that attention is called to the conduct of ‘Jimmy ”’ manager of the Library, during its contest with the Ninth on Friday afternoon. It is assumed that ‘‘ Jimmy ’’ was honest in his belief that his own construction of the rule regarding ‘‘blocked balls’? was correct, and that he was within his rights when he protested, but when he withdrew his men from the field when the decision went against him he committed an act that was a direct affront to the players and more than a hundred men from the ‘‘Blocks’’ who were interested spectators. It was an act, the consummation of which meant, the curtailment of a great privilege one of similar, which if persisted in must inevitably lead to the abolishment of the League. It requires no great discernment to anticipate the action of the Warden. if this sort of “baby play” is continued, and certainly would be a grave mistake to allow the faults of a few to detract from the privileges of so many. One of the governing attributes of a manly man is his consideration of the comfort and pleasures of others. Let it be hoped that ‘‘Jimmy’’ knows this and in the future will act accordingly. Bill, Shed short-stop, bid goodbye to his batting slump by smashing Curly for a home run. Keep it up!</p>
