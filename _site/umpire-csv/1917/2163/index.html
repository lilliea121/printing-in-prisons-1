<p>HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROADBy Sam Walter FossThere are hermit souls that live withdrawn In the peace of their self-contentThere are souls, like stars, that dwell apart In a fellowless firmamentThere are pioneer souls that blaze their paths Where the highways never ran-But let me live by the side of the road,And be a friend to man.Let me live in a house by the side of the road, Where the race of men go by-The men who are good, and the men who are badAs good and as bad as I.I would not sit in the scorner's seat Or hurl the cynic's ban -Let me live in a house by the side of the road,And be a friend to man.I see from my house by the side of the road-By the side of the highway of life,The men who press with ardor of hope, The men who are faint with strife .But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears-Both parts of an Infinite plan-Let me live by the side of the road,And be a friend to man.I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead,And mountains of wearisome height;And the road passes on through the long afternoon,And stretches away to the night;But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,And weep with the strangers that moan, Let me live in my house by the side of theroad,And be a friend to man.Let me live in my house by the side of theroad,Where the race of men go by-They are good--they are bad--weak and strong,Wise foolish, so am I.Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat Or hurl the cynic's ban?Let me live in my house by the side of theroad,And be a friend to man.</p>
