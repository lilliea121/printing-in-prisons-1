<h1>Prison Investigation by New Jersey’s Governor</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>Prison Investigation by New Jersey’s GovernorIt is publicly announced that Governor Edge will institute an inquiry into state institution methods at an early date, although it is contended many of the charges respecting conditions and methods at the state prison in Trenton have been slightly exaggerated or shown to be unduly enlarged upon. Recent disclosures, both official and otherwise, are said to have demonstrated that the institution is far from being as it should.Without prejudging the charges and counter-charges involving the various branches of the prison management, Governor Edge made it plain that the whole subject will receive liis early and earnest attention. While it is not the immediate purpose of the Governor to force a one-sided investigation of the prison management, still, it is expected that whatever is undertaken will be followed out in a most searching and thorough manner. It is expected that this will disclose the actual seat of the trouble, and will eventually lead to the adoption of such measures as will result in the enforcing of modern reform methods.</p>
