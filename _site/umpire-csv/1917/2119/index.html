<p>Queensland Savages Fading AwayThe aborigines of Queensland are fast fading away, and in view of the fact that this race will be extinct an examination of their social customs is interesting.The death bone or bone apparatus, with its supposed property of producing death, is one of the most dreaded and universal superstitions among the natives of the Queensland interior. The apparatus consists of a pointer connected by a string with an elongated cylindrical receptacle. The pointer, three to five inches long, is made from a human forearm bone, the string is made from human hair, and the receptacle, which encloses the victim's lifeblood, is fashioned from a shinbone. The &quot;medicine man&quot; of the tribe uses the weapon by aiming the pointer at the pers onselected for punishment.One of the most curious of the aboriginalweapons is the &quot;whirler,&quot; or &quot;bull roarer.&quot;It is made of a flattened piece of gidyea timber cut into spindle shape, into one extremity of which a hole is drilled with a sharpened emu bone. By means of the aperture this whirler is attached to a piece of stick fixed at the end of a small stick. Revolving rapidly, the whirler gives out a roaring sound.</p>
