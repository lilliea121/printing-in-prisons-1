These are the rules: He should be honest, truthful, sincere and serious. He should believe in and preach and practice the Golden Rule. He should be strong and healthy, physically and morally. His habits and mode of living should be temperate and clean and his companions selected with regard to their character and reputation. He should possess good natural ability and a determination constantly to improve his mind and memory. He should possess a good education, including particularly the fundamentals, such as mathematics, grammar, spelling, writing, geography and history; and also a technical education concerning the lines he purposes to follow. He should be studious and thoughtful, keeping his mind upon a subject until it is mastered. He should be conscientious, modest but courageous, energetic, persistent, even-tempered, economical, faithful and loyal to his friends and the interests he represents.</p>
