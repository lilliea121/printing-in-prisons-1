<h1>Reforming Society</h1>

<p>REFORMING SOCIETY In an address which was delivered before the American Prison Association some time ago, Frank Moore, superintendent of the New Jersey Reformatory, called the attention of his hearers to some pertinent facts that are well worthy of repeating, and as the New Era comments, “he struck the keynote in real, practical ideas of reform.” In the course of his address Mr. Moore said: “Reform society and you not only reform the prison, but you remove it. Every prison is a monument to society’s failures, but we must plead that society, which may never have given to the prisoner a fair chance before he was sent to prison, shall at least take a second sober thought and give him at least one good, fair, square chance when he gets out of prison. “If our cities were cleaner, had more moral and wholesome places to live in, there would not be near as many who would be contaminated with the smear of crime and have to be taken to prison.” That is good logic. “Reform society first, and the task of reforming men in prison will be an easy one. No one has as yet advanced a plausible argument to disprove the fact that the cause of crime is chiefly due to social economics and to society’s indifference toward the thousands of individuals who only ask for a fair fighting chance.”</p>
