<h1>The Sting of the Honey-Bee</h1>

<p>THE STING OF THE HONEY-BEE In proportion to its size, the sting of the honeybee is probably the most effective -infernal machine in existence. The stinging apparatus is smaller than that of a rattlesnake, yet a single sting has been known to kill a man. When we realize that it is almost invisible and consider what it can do we cannot fail to be astounded. It seems the very quintessence of devilishness. The honeybee’s sting is complicated—so complicated that many words and much ink have been used in discussing its construction and use. It is generally conceded that the sting consists of a shaft of three parts, the principal one being a sheath within which move two barbed lancets. Like the barbs of a fishhook, the lancets are not easily extracted from the flesh into which they have been driven. The sheath and the lancets combined form a hollow tube through which the poison flows from the poison sac. The hairy, soft projections, evidently very sensitive, inform the bee when she is in contact with a stingable object.</p>
