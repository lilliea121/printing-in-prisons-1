<h1>Brazil’s Great Future</h1>

<p>BRAZIL’S GREAT FUTURE It is generally known that Argentina is the great. meat-exporting country of South America and that some of the European countries (notably Great Britain), have been depending largely on this source of supply. Now, however, according to the bulletin of the Pan-American Union, Brazil is also developing its cattle industry, and numerous’ packing houses have been established within the past few years. To show the growth of the industry, it is stated that while in 1915 Brazil exported something over 8500 tons of beef, valued at about $1,500,000, during the first six. months of 1916 its meat exports amounted to over 12,300 tons, valued at $2, 425, 000, and a conservative estimate places the total exports for this year at from 40,000 to 50,600 tons, worth from $8,000,000 to $10,000,000. It is also estimated that the value of Brazil’s hide exports for 1916 will reach $20,000,000. As an exporting country in the lines of cattle. products, Brazil is therefore second only to Argentina, notwithstanding the fact that the industry is but in its infancy in the country. What a country that will be for the young man seeking a future.</p>
