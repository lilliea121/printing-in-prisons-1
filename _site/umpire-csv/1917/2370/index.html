<h1>What a Great Book Does</h1>

<p>WHAT A GREAT BOOK DOES One of our leading educators once said, that it was difficult to reckon what a yearbook does. He was asked, “What did the ‘Pilgrim’s Progress’ do for England?” What has been its effect on the language? Could we say it has done for English prose what Burns did for poetry—”showed how it may build a princely throne on humble truth”? What has been its influence as the most widely read and translated work of the imagination in English—a book accessible to millions who never read Shakespeare, where they may meet a world of men, men outside ~ their ordinary range, and yet intelligible and individual, knowable as one’s next-door neighbors are not? What again has the book meant in the religious history of England? What has been done for English liberty by the book and its writer together? And supposing he had been talked round and had agreed no longer “devilishly and perniciously to abstain from coming to church to hear divine service,” and to be no longer “an upholder of several unlawful meetings and conventicles to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of the kingdom, contrary to the laws of our sovereign lord, the King, etc.”? Bedford might have kept a tinker the more—and possibly none of the best at that, for there is nothing to show that renegades make good tinkers—and what would England have lost?</p>
