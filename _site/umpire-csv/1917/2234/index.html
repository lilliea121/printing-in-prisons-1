<p>International Law(Printed by Request.)According to reliable authorities the affirmation that international law is at one and the same time both national and international has very far-reaching and practical significance for the work of building a new international order.All the courts of Great Britain, beginning with Lord Chancellor Talbot in 1733 and including Lord Chief Justice Mansfield in 1764, have held that the law of nations is part of the common law of England. No less a person than Sir William Blackstone supported this principle in his Commentaries. This principle also holds good equally well in the United States as in Great Britain, a fact to which both Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton bore decisive testimony, as may be easily noted by re f erring to United States history.One would not have to look further back than the present generation to find that the United States supreme court has held that international law is part of our law and that, in order to ascertain and administer it in cases where there is no treaty and no controlling executive or legislative act or judicial decision, resort must be had to the customs and usages of civilized nations.</p>
