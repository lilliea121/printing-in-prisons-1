<h1>We Need More Like Him</h1>

<img width="200" src="/assets/img/" />
<p>The Hon. Jacob H. Schiff, of New York, recently celebrated his seventieth birthday by giving and not receiving a present. He graciously but firmly declined the banquet that his friends offered him, and in place thereof made the munificent gift of $100,000 to the American Red Cross, the largest gift the organization has received since the beginning of the war. It is his wish that two-thirds of the sum be spent in relieving distress in the Entente countries and one-third be used similarly in the Central Empires.It is said that Mr. Seniff did this in response to President Wilson's recent appeal fpr the Red Cross, and it sets a splendid example which other rich men and women might very well follow.If there were m,we Americans of this high type of thought and breadth of action, this world would be that much better for their being in it, and for the elevating influence it would exert for the good of others.</p>
