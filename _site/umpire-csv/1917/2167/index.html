<h1>Our Un-Americans</h1>

<p>Our Un-AmericansA majority of the American people, in the East, at least, have ceased to think about the war in terms of the United States. They are pro-British or pro-French or pro-German, and non-American, is the opinion of an editorial writer in the New York World.They have forgotten that their country has any direct relationship to this conflict or has any rights that it is bound to protect unless those rights happen to coincide with the aims of one set of belligerents or another. The time has come, in his opinion, for the United States to insist up,m a dear and precise definition of the aims and objects of the war from both sides. When we have that, it will be the less difficult to determine the future policy of the United States in respect to the war itself . If we are in danger of being drawn into it, we certainly have a right to know what we are being drawn into.</p>
