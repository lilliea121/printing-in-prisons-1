<p>E.S.P. Gives Song Service on the CenterThe last day of the old year was marked by a well rendered song service on the Center, at this institution, by the inmate choir, accompanied by the E. S. P. orchestra, under the skillful direction of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt.The program was selected from the popular sacred songs of the day, and elicited considerable praise from those present, especially the baritone solo by B 7962, who possesses a rich baritone voice well above the average singer. B 6252 presided at the piano with consummate skill.The concluding number of the program was the signal for Chaplain Joseph Welch to address the assembly in a spirited and able manner on the subject of ''Moral Uplift,'' which was punctuated by many striking remarks that found a ready response from his hearers in repeated applause. The Chaplain was followed by Warden R. J. McKenty, who briefly outlined a few of the new bills for the relief of the families of men serving time at penal institutions, which are to be introduced at this session of the legislature.** *** PROGRAM1.
