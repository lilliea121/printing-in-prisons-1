<p>Honor Club NotesThe members formed in line promptly at 12:30, noon. First came the hospital (3rd) block, who from courtesy and consideration is to have the choice of seats. Remember, boys (others), that applies only to our sick friends, so keep off. Then in double file came the members of the 1st Section. You could hear the query from one to the other, &quot;Who's this girl, Mlle. Elba? What kind of an act does she do?&quot; &quot;Just wait!&quot; was the reply. And so, with their interest whetted up, they came in the amusement hall, a body of men willing to be pleased, with a hope for the very best to be had. And they got it-the very best there was. First, Director of Music Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, turned loose a burst of harmony in Mendelssohn's processional, a march rarely attempted; but the H. F. C. orchestra was equal to it, and none had a criticism. The Vice-President (A 8432) gave the address of welcome, bidding every one to enjoy himself. The orchestra gave an overture, and the show was on.The film, &quot;Jordan is a Hard Road to Travel,&quot; appealed to the audience in many ways, and stirred the blood at times. Then gradually the sentiment insinuated itself when the Adam's apple was hard to swallow, and then the satisfaction that the matter ended the way you'd have it end.How does Mr. Kraupa know the wants of the H. F. C. audience? Each picture he has given us had the situations in them to make the blood quicken and just the amount of moral to cause the thought, right is right because it's right.· Leave it to Mr. Kraupa. He is ALL RIGHT.While the picture was being shown the audience was given a surprise and a treat. Suddenly the sweet, plaintive notes of a clarionet, appealingly and clear, then its fellow, joined in, and B 6244 and B 8099, accompanied by B 6252 on the piano, gave a clarionet duet rendition of &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; that was good, and pleased all who heard it.The vaudeville opened with Ollie White, and the splendid music she produced on her violin pronounced her a past mistress of the instrument. After two difficult and pleasing scores she was joined by her husband, and they gave the audience a chance to note professional violin played by professional violinists. Splendid does not express this act; it was a point better. The applause was great, and on the encore they did a classic feature. Two encores and three curtains they answered.Many U. F. C. members recognized Hughey Connelly when he came on in his singing and dancing act. His monologue was rich in good jokes, but the audience was quick to catch the point and gave him hearty applause. As a dancer he certainly shines in the star class; it was almost impossible to keep run on his feet. He sang· a song that combined a line of the words and music of each of the popular songs, and when, with  no warning, he would change from one song to another, he came near finding the Club pianist's (B 6252) goat, but Charlie held on to the horns, and got on, and rode them with bells. The applause was deafening.Marie Dolan, a juvenile artist, and a dear, sweet little miss, gave us the next act; a sweet singer with a very good act. Her dancing was very good. She submitted to two encores and three curtains, and the audience was not half satisfied.Cooley and Snyder made a hit. His makeup just forced a laugh, and as a buffer to his eccentricities Miss Cooley was sweet and dainty, and with her sweet voice and dainty manner made the act good and enjoyable . A fine act by fine artists. Two encores and three curtain-calls were theirs, and richly deserved, too.Our Indian friends, ''The Musical Seminoles,'' made good their promise to come again. &quot;Melec Alee Bushwa&quot; said the &quot;Big Chief,&quot; aid the &quot;papoose&quot; said &quot;Bushwa.&quot; That means anything you will have it, but they were happy and so was the audience. Difficult as their performance was they kindly repeated an encore and answered as long as they possibly could.The H. F. C. extends the pipe of peace, ''Big Chief,&quot; and a cigarette to &quot;papoose.&quot;Miss Mae Russell came on the stage to introduce Mlle. Petite Elba, the world's greatest juvenile artist. Some name for such a dear little person to carry, but she holds it up, and makes good. Again was the youngest member of the H. F. C. (younger even than Pete) on the stage with her inimitable act. From her dainty song ''What's the use of being good, nobody seems to care,'' to her imitation of Charlie Chaplin, she went through her repertoire and the clever little artist had such a cold that she could not give her performance on Saturday night, but the -brave soul said, &quot;I just must go out to the H. F. C.&quot; The Vice-President (A 8432) presented her with a medal, the work and gift of B 6764, one of the skilled silver workers of the H. F. C., who made and engraved the medal. She was very proud as she left the stage, to quickly return and thank the Club for the box given by them last week. Afterward she presented the sergeant-at-arms (B 7495) with her autograph photograph. Long life to you, Mlle. Petite Elba; may the love for your clever performance, and the reverence for your dainty sweetness, be the means of making the members of the H. F. C. better men for your coming.The &quot;Bath House Blunders&quot; was the closing film on the screen. &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle was there. He was asleep, but the antics of the rest of the bunch were comic and mirth-provoking, and sent the audience home (?)amused and of one mind. “This is the best show we've had yet.&quot; But how can that be? Miss Mae Rusaell and Mr. Kraupa are not dead yet and are our friends.“The Man in the Box” and “Doc Bird” did well today. Baked potatoes is the reason. Where was Herbert? It is encouraging to the members to note the array of visitors- tho indications of their confidence in the members and preference their presence to the entertainment of spending their afternoon amid different environs. The members thank them, and urge that they continue to grace the hall with their presence.Mrs. R . C. (President) McKenty, with Miss Edith Ferris and Miss Kennedy, were there, as was Miss Elsie McKenty and Miss Jennie Davy, with a lady friend.The members were quick to note Inspector Horstmann and appreciated his interest.The absence of the Warden was noted with regret. He sent word that if he-could possibly get out he would be there. The members of the H. F. C. never lose sight of the fact that to the Warden they owe all the privileges that are enjoyed and hope that he realizes that the privileges are appreciated.The President (Mr. R. C. McKenty) had full charge, and said that the conduct while in the hall was all to be desired.Mr. R. H. Cross and son, of the Vaudeville Exchange, and Miss Catherine Graham were guests of Miss Mae Russell and the H. F. C.Miss Russell left some copies of her infant, The Vaudeville Times, which will be distributed as far as they go. It's good reading.The Club welcomed Mr. Robert Myers and Mr. Thomas Collins, two gentlemen who by their presence indicate a friendliness for the H.F.C.Notice-It must be distinctly understood that each member upon leaving the amusement hall must go directly to his cell. No loitering in the yard will be tolerated. A breach of this rule will call suspension without further warning.BY ORDER OF THE PRESIDENT. 2nd Sec., Jan. 27,1917,10B,6 B, 6 G,8B, 9B, 11B, 12-2G,12-1G, 12B, 1B.-B 7542.</p>
