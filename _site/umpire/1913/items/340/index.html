<p>And then I think it is not strange
That men who live in jails are bad
The Walls are made so high and gray</p>
<p>It is enough to make them sad
And I dont think in all the world
Wouléd be a naughty child notone
Or grow up into wicked men
If they could have the morning sun.</p>
<p>— T. A. Daly.</p>
