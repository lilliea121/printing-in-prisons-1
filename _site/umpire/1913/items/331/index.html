<p>THERE are many thousands of unem-
ployed men walking the streets of every
large city to-day, bitterly deploring the
lack of ever an ordinary education, which
they know is the real cause of their piti-
able condition.</p>
<p>A large percentage of these men are
physically incapable of competing a-
gainst their more robust fellows, when
the foreman is selecting his men, to take
up even the hard rough work of unskill-
ed labor. Hence they are thrust aside,
and will ever be.</p>
<p>The man of brawn without an educa-
tion of some sort, seldom arises above
that station claimed by the common la-
borer.</p>
<p>For the man who is wanting in both
education and brawn, there is no room
in this busy world; he is ruthlessly
crowded to the wall, and in all too many
instances, he is even forced through the
wall into such a community as this one,
of which we form a part. These men
never had a chance. It may have been
through their own lack of appreciation
of the importance of an education, or
again it may have been through nofault
of their own. But wherever the blame,
he would be a man beyond hope, were
he to fail to grasp the opportunity when
it is again offered to him,</p>
<p>A strong commendation of the intelli-|.</p>
<p>gence of the men here, lies in the state-
ment, that nearly five hundred of them
are now receiving instructions in both
elementary and advanced courses in
English, and better yet, that tully ninety
five per cent of them are making rapid
advancement, reflecting credit upon the
efforts of Mr. Bonsall, the instructor and
the men who are cheerfully giving their
aid in assisting their fellows in
ing an education.</p>
<p>The elementary course includes, read-
ing, writing, arithmetic, geography and</p>
<p>obtain-</p>
<p>history, and this is supplemented by
higher courses in mathematics and gram-</p>
<p>mar in the Mentor Correspondence
School. In the latter, the men are re-
ceiving individual instruction in the</p>
<p>studies they elect, and upon the comple-
tion of the full course, are awarded cer-
tificates of graduation. Many men have
attained, and others are now striving for
this honor, and only recently diplomas
were granted to 5570, 4591, 5493, 5631,
5402, 5577 and 5719. One man, B 5570
went through the entire course without
a single failure, attaining a (ﬂaduatmo
average of 100 per cent.</p>
<p>This educational work is going on
throughout the year, and any man with
the slightest adaptability may make
wonderful progress within this short
time, if he only will. The officers are
certainly doing their part, and doing it
well. In return, they only require earn-</p>
<p>est application on the part of the men,]|
for with that, they know the results will
be favorable,—and it is for favorable
results that they are working.</p>
