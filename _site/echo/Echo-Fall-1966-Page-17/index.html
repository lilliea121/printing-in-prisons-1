<p>On July 27, 1966, we had the privilege of inter.
viewing two members of the Parolce Committee of
the Junior Chamber of Commeree of Philadelphin</p>
<p>Parole Counselor Wendell Bristol arranged the
conference, which took place in the ECHO offee with

<p>The men_explained that
Commerce is a service orga
st thirty
munity service as its goal. Their parolee spon
