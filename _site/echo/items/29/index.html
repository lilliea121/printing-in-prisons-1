<p>“Man, T ain't worried about getting out, T know when that will be. m concerned with staying out.”</p>
<p>Strange words? Not really.</p>
<p>One inmate speaks the words but many more arc also concerned with this problem. And if is &amp; prob- lem. The latest figure T have read shows 86% of in mates released return to prison® Statisties can he misleading and T want to believe that this one is But T ean't he sure. Tm worried now! 1 haven't been released vet, and the odds are 3% to 4 that T will come back.</p>
<p>Let us look at this a little closer. Bighty-six mates out of every 100 return to prison and with erime on the ineréase, the intake of new prisoners has inereased considerably. If only 14 men out of 100 remain out and the new inmates in tarn become one of the 86 out of 100, it stands to reason that prison populations are getting larger and larger. Tt this continues then we can assume with statistical logie that one day everyone will be behind the wall Well, we will have attained something, anyway. We would be rid of ex-convicts.</p>
<p>To be sure, T have allowed myself to be carried away; but only to show the fallacy of statisties. Re- gardless of the percentage of men who return, it is stll too many. Why is this so? We read numerous articles in the newspapers and magazines about the rehabilitation programs being instituted in our pris- ans. This should solve the problem.</p>
<p>Rehabilitation is an impressive word. It sounds important. Webster says it means to restore to good</p>

<p>repute; to fit to make one’s livelihood again. How is one fit to make one’s livelihood again when one had o Tivelihood to begin with? The majority of men in prison come from poverty areas, have little ednen tion and, in most eases, no trade or eraft in order to n a deeent livelihood by today's standards. Prison does little to change this. Today, high school classes offered to all who want them terminating with o high sehool equivaleney diploma. This is a means o an end, not an end in itself. The next logieal step. would seem to be voeational training in one eraft or another. This is where the rub comes in. Except for a few of the Correctional Tndustries, the possibilities of acquiring a skill that would be acceptable by the. fons outside are extremely rare Contrary to popular belief, prisons have not ehanged. New names have been bestowed upon them array of faney titles for the pesonnel but prisons are the same a8 they have always been, The greatest amount of jobs to be had wre prison ori ented, i, cell block runners, yard eleaners, bross polishers,” sweepers, moppers, pot_washers, table wipers and assorted labor work. The few men who enter prison with any skill are immediately placed into those spots, leaving little chance for the un. skilled. Correetional Industries</p>
<p>not, in itself, the answer. It could be, but at present it offers little opportunity for the individual to acquire a skill that, would be on a competitive level with outside industry. They on. compass the products that will be used mainly by ‘prisons, state hospitals and various state-operated in stitutions. The machinery and equipment is usually antiquated, instruction personnel at &amp; minimum and ‘production'is geared t at the lowest possible cost.</p>
<p>The Printing Plant at Eastern Correctional Inst tution is one of the exceptions. Printing is one of the highest paying industries in the United States and has only just begun to realize its potential. Our plant is equipped with contemporary machines and uses production methods incorporated from outside industry. Experienced instructors supervise all op- erations of printing from beginning to end, but more are needed. Through the efforts of Mr. Veto Tavecchia, General Supervisor, and Mr. Al French, Printing Instructor, the local printing trade unions have been approached with the idea of accepting qualified men into the union and placing them into positions of employment upon discharge from the institution. The unions have reacted favorably to this and, to date, there are a fow dozen men working at this crat; linotype operators, compositors, press- men, and two men who have become department foremen.</p>
<p>‘The Printing Plant is, by no means, the answer to a gigantic problem, it s only a small beginning. The problem, immense though it is, must have o begin: ning if it is ever to have an end.</p>
