<p>THINK YOU HAVE TROUBLES?</p>
<p>PEOPLE ALL OVER COMPLAIN OF THE ODDEST THINGS</p>
<p>A Pasadena, California, woman complained to the police that someone was breaking into her home every sight...and leaving money in her pursc!</p>
<p>Brownsville, Texas, lawnen heard the story of sine-year-old boy who was beset and pummeled by a group of angry little gi</p>
<p>In New Britain, Conne someone was picking up his small foriegn car from its parking place in front of his house, and putting it in the middle of the road!</p>
<p>Even stranger conplaints have resounded in the cars of law enforcement officials throughout the world.</p>
<p>In Hanau, Germany, it was alleged that a hotel man- ager was turning bedbugs loose in a competitor's hotel. A farmer in Lodi, Ttaly, complained that someone had</p>
<p>pped into his pasture and snipped the taila off his 39 cows. A London women said that her landlord, who wanted her to move, had seen her wash drying on the line and had sprinkled her undies with itching powder!</p>
<p>Lawnen, of course, aren’t the only people who hear odd complaints in the line of daty. Doctors do, too. Valentin Medina, a 61-year-dd Spanish farmhand, pre- sented himself in 1960 at a Madrid hospital with the claim that he never slept. A hometown doctor affirmed that he had never known Medina to catch a wink of sleep in 50 years!</p>
<p>Commonest health complaint? It scemsto be atoss- up between the common cold and the headaches the per- son who has totally escaped either one is a medical rarity. The average American gets thece colds year, and an estimated 85% of Americans suffer from head- aches.</p>
<p>t, a man charged that</p>
<p>ety of other complai the world’s most widely-used medication. Americ alone take about 16 billion aspirin tablets a year; rec- eatly, The Bayer Company produced its 100 billionth aspirin tablet. Small wonderit's been said that the two things which answer more complaints -than anything in the world are the police department and the</p>
<p>in tablet! But even aspirin probably would not have cured the “headache”” of the young couple who returmed to their</p>
<p>Foll 1966</p>
<p>Pucblo, California, home after a vacation...and found that someone had entered the house in their and mixed about 30 gallons of chery-flavored gelatin in the bathtub</p>
<p>On the other hand, a Tokyo man might have done well to gulp a couple of aspirin tablets before he de- cided that an inefficient telephone operator gave him o pain...and showed his annoyance by setting fire to the phone booth!</p>
<p>Short tempers have spureed other bizarre complaiats, In Cleveland, Ohio, a complaint was filed against &amp; painter who grabbed a women and painted both her ams greea. Seems she'd been bothering him with re- peated criticiams of the way he was painting her garage.</p>
<p>The all-time bad sportmanship record is probably. held by the giel in Schongau, Germany, who attended her fomer beaw’s wedding...and demonateated her di pleasure by knocking him down during the ceremony!</p>
<p>ght fingered citizens come in for their share of crazy charges. In Tuscon, Arizona, somebody broke intoa chicken coop twice inone week, each tine steal- ing a hen and replacing it with a rooster!</p>
<p>But that was nothing compared with the exploit of the unknown thief who filched a 2&quot; x 18&quot; strip of as- phalt from a Dunstable, Massachusetts, street...or the burglar in Santiago, Chile, who entered @ man's house while he slept, ifted him gently off the bed and put him on the floor without awakening him...then made off with the bed!</p>
<p>Less oblivious t it all was the Davenport, lowa, woman who complained that a tecnager had ridden @ bicyele over her back while she lay sunbathing in the park.</p>
<p>Some people won't give a man a sporting chance: a complaint filed in Columbus, Ohio, stated that six men were ganbling in the waiting room of the unemploy- ment office.</p>
<p>Ou the other hand you can't bi inois, resturant owner for being man secking a snack entered bi</p>
<p>1t had to happen and in Vani Philippines, a man complained that his dog had been severely bitten on the neck...by a seventeen-year old boy!</p>
<p>me a Garfield, Ill- concerted when o on horscback!</p>
