<p>it's been</p>
<p>Following publication of the Tenth Anniversary issue of Eastern Echo, zine will be under the cditorship of Bob Wallander and o new 1 staff (sec: 5o here i am, page 7). Barring the unforseen, 1 will departed this gray and brownstone “bastille” by the time the Tenth Anniver. sary issue comes off the press. As T step aside, it scems appropriate to sa Tt has been....</p>
<p>My association with the Eeho and the incumbent staff members over the past two years, hus been richly rewarding. 1 am convinced my staf associates, individually and collectively, are among the best that have ever served Echo. 1 Together we have faced, challenged, and, to some extent, resolved many of the problems beseting Echo magazine. Some of the problems yielded to solution only after laborious, time-consuning encounters. The effect of those encounters upon the staff can be described as disheartening. The effect was temporary, however. Through it al, the stall never lost faith, We now take some pride in Knowing that we have contributed t0 laying the groundwork upon which the new editor and his staff can develop @ reasonably viable, smoothly functioning publication. Echo now has the potential to surpass present goals—goals which, when looked bick upon at some future date, may secm modest and quaint, T would challenge the new editors, therefor, to strive to outdistance us!</p>
<p>L would further urge upon my suceessors the need to argue and debate X individual points of difference. Be open minded and objective. Listen, talk— B learn! True consensus can emerge only through the frec exchange of ideas. ! The result being that, as regards editorial policy, when you speak through the magazine, it will be with one resounding voice. Policy arrived at through caucus should not be diffcult to jusify rationally and intelligently to the offcal family.</p>
<p>As editor of the outgoing staff I take full responsibility for errors in Judgment and tactics. In an operation dealing so intimately with human Traity, perfection cannot and should not be expected. Recognition of failings constitute, in my opinion, growth and progress.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it is impossible to please everyone. There will always be that clement of readers—inside and outside—who will disagree; their words isuing from the entrance—or if you will—the exit of hollow drums.</p>
<p>Such frivolous responses should not be allowed to wndermine your sense of ) responsibility to the majority of inmates.</p>
<p>T would like to see the new staff develop some of the programs our staff has been promoting and supporting. Some of these include: a) seeking. - support.from the Ford Foundation for . special two year penal press pilot project, The American Foundstion would be of vital assstance as our advoeate {for this project with Ford. b) development of an enlarged circulation program, soliciting subscriptions from lawyers, judges, public officials, doctors, business. men; sérvice, social, fraternal, civie and religious groups; ¢) improved public relations and inter-institution relation programs.</p>
<p>It is important to encourage many more inmates to participate in Echo's program. But it is cqually important to give inmates credit for that which they do when they do it. Don't be afraid to print many names in the magazine.</p>
<p>Best wishes, much luck and suceess!</p>
<p>J. Hass 2 Eostern</p>
