<p>William Palmer scored his first
vietory for ESP in 1958 against
Temple University. This was the
firstmateh against outside chess
teams. Palmer was transfered
shortly after this match and has
returned only recently to the elub.</p>
<p>Though lacking his former
sharpness, Palmer. shows oecusion-
al signs of regaining his previous
form, He is noted for his solid
positional type of play rather
than an aggressive attacking style.</p>

nents when they fail to counter.

<p>Joseph Antoniewiez is another
player who advanced through the
ranks for a place in the top ten.
Twice he has finished second in
the Club_Championship Tourna
ments and was o member of the
Championship Industrial League
Teams of 1964 and 1965.</p>
<p>Playing third board on the
Championship Team has brought
Antoniewiez up_against. some of
the top players in this area, and
although he has not had a great
deal of sucecss against them, due
to their greater theoretical knowl-
edge, his performance has been
commendable.</p>

<p>Herbert Mitehell is_constantly
in and out of the ranks of the
top ten. He loves to play chess,
providing it moves at a brisk
pace. This passion for fast mov-
ing has cost him many a game
that should have been in the vic-
tory column. He has always been
a frifle above our average player
but he refuses to exert himself
t0 attain a higher rating.</p>
<p>Sinee joining the club he has
competed in two Champio
Tournaments, finishing ninth and
tenth respectively.</p>
