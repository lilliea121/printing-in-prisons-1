<p>Echo to be printed black ink on white, cheaper paper throughout. This
is being done for economy reasons, ease of printing plus speed in production.
But more: We are going to look like we mean business, and we d</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be a “local news section.” Tn this section will appear any
‘noteworthy prison happenings. Chess, sports, music pages or sections or depart-
ments will no longer exist as such. “Local News” will be treated considerately
but briefly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Somehow, in a journal of serious inmate thought, the movie schedule
‘hardly seems important—especially as it does appear elsewhere and is not timely
in the Echo. That's serapped !</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crossword puzzles are to be found in each Philadelphia paper delivered
to this prison. Ours—is gone!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Articles will not be solicited from the prison’s staff for publication in
the Echo—with one exception. Mr. Brierley will be urged to say more to us
in his message. Other members of prison stafl not excluded from writing in
Echo—but may have article(s) rejected. All articles are subject to editorial
comment. (See six)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number five must have our chaplains wondering. Echo is not for or
against any particular religion in its journalistic policy. Echo will support
moral tenets of all religions and of all churches where they are, in fact, being
actively pursued. Sunday school sermon.type articles are not Echo material—if
articles authored by the clergy contain an obvious or subtle theme along the
lines that the author’s church represents the “one true religion”” or is the
*‘chosen” or “best” for whatever reason being applied, such an article will
be rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Editorial type page cartoons welcome. They can say so much.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poetry will be scattered throughout the journal and not confined to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vital statistics—population count, deaths, paroles, pardons, ete,, are
to be noted.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>10, Letters to the cditor from all sources will be welcomed. These become
the property of the Echo and will be published—though eritical or compli
‘mentary—when space permits. Letters to the editor of the Echo must be signed
and living quarters of the inmate designated. That way we of the Echo stafl
can readily verify if the inmate whose name is signed is the actual sender.</p>
<p>11 Tomates having diffeulty in seeuring a job for possible release may
insert an ad of &amp; general nature (specifying job skills) in the Eastern Echo.
Any replies will be handled through our institutional parole counselor.</p>
<p>GOT SOMETHING TO SAY?</p>
<p>SAY IT IN THE ECHO!</p>
