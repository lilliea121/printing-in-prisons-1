<p>Each editor pervaded the magazine with his own
special personality. To speak in terms of this nataral
trait a5 contributing to the snecess of the magazine
would be a prevarication. The majority of Eeho
Editors assumed_their literary position untrained,
and painfully groped their way through many dif:
fieult situntions. It has been said that *The writer
a5 well as the orator employs for the accomplishment
of his purposes, the instrumentality of words. It is
in words that he clothes his thoughts. It is by means
of words that he depiets his feelings. Tt is, therefore,
essential to his success that he be provided with
copious vocabulary and that he possess an entire
command of all the resources and appliances of his
language.”</p>
<p>These words will be recognized by many of our
readers, for they embody a principal that s neces.
sary but not often possible</p>
<p>In spite of the temporary drawbacks T have
mentioned, the Eastern Echo can well be proud of
its Titerary_achievements.  Tn 1960 Mrs. ‘Dorothy
Seheer, long a champion of the rehabilitation of men
and women in prison, lauded the Eastern Echo 18
one of the finest in the entire national Penal Prots”
Other words of commendation have come from such
persons as Dr. Negley K. Teters, Professor of Soci.
clogy; Morris Gerber, Esq, (formerly # judge in
Montgomery County); Jumes W. Percy, &quot; (former
asistant. o Mayor of ‘Lancaster); Erle Stanley
Gardner, Writer, and many others. Echo has recoived
similar commendations from various agencies and
boards like the Pennsylvania Prison Society, the Halt.
way Houses and others, (My apologies to those indi-
viduals T have not mentioned by name, for they have
been the unstng heroes of our cause.) Without the
encouragement of these people during the Fastern
Echo's ten_year_ existence, the magazine could not
have been possible.</p>
<p>For a few years the Eastern Echo basked in the
1959.60-61 tributes that had been heaped upon its
literary head. Soon thereafter it went into decline
after being condemned by a few persons who rose o
the prison thrones of offcialdom estranged from and
antagonistic to modern concepts of penology. Their
inimical precepts took the form of extreme restric-
tions on_ material nccepted for_publication. ' Thus,
they inhibited writing skills previously displayed and
retarded the latent skills of the would-be writr.</p>
<p>The magazine that once had attracted distin-
guished persons to actually submit articles, commen.
tary or intelligent rebuttals to opinions, degenerated
into a retrogressive format. For it has been proven
that “resting on past laurels,” however justiied, can
only result in stagnati</p>
<p>Subject material of the Eastern Echo during its
decade of publication has been diverse, with many
shades of literary differences. Some of the subjects
delved in included Parole and Commutation, Juvenle
Delinquency, Psychology and Psychiatry in Prisons,
Worldvide Penal Treatment, Prison Reform, Modern
Penlogy, Criminal Law, Prison Labor, and. others

<p>On many occasions the persons listed wore asked
to present their views on a partieular subject. This
was done in_ order to acquaint the reader with the
other side. The editor responsible for this inteligent
presentation was Smith. He believed
that this kind of objective approach would evoke 4
reater interest in he magasine,</p>
<p>He figured that most people had a slanted view
on what the man in prison was aiming for, and o
present divergent views would provide.the stimulus
for creative thinking us well as writing. The many
letters of praise that poured into the institution
from people of all walks of life lent validity to s
reasoning,</p>
