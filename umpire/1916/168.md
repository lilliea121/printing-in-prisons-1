HONOR CLUB NOTES

The 1st Section found its Saturday outing
a most pleasant occasion. The weather had
about attained to the golden mean, the enter-
tainment features were more than usually
good, and no untoward incident occurred to
mar the perfection of the day. Certainly
every one went home to five o’clock tea in
havpiest mood.

In what will doubtless be the last parade
of the season, the boys fairly outdid them-
selves. The marching was so uniformly
good that it was difficult to pick a winner,
but we think the boys from the 11th Block
had a shade the best of it. Even the band
seemed to be in martial mood, march music
predominating, very much to the satisfaction
of all. Professor Wiegandt is certainly to be

~congratulated upon his achievements, and to

the band itself we point with pride.

Mr. Kroup, who will provide the profes-
sional talent for the Club’s entertainments,
was present with several of his artists, and
was prevailed upon by Mr. Dipple to say a
few words. He assured us of his intention

GERMAN U-BOAT SINKS 10 SHIPS

Late news reports of the German U-boat,
which called at Newport on Saturday, are to
the effect that the raider sent nine British and
one Dutch vessel to the bottom.
