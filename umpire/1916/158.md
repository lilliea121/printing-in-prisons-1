ONE WHO TRIED TO MAKE GOOD

Our attention was recently called to a story
published in a New York paper, that for base
ingratitude and pure malevolence would seem
hard to beat.

As the story goes, a man who was a fugi-
tive from Indiana justice was apprehended in
New York through the perfidy of a former
cellmate. According to the facts of the case
the fugitive had forged a $400-check and had
been sentenced in 1904 to serve from two to
fourteen years. ‘‘He served twelve, being a
model prisoner, without a demerit against
him. He had often talked with his cellmate
of the possibilities of escape, of pardon and
of parole, and had been assured that Indiana
justice knew neither pardon nor parole, and
that escape was impossible. But he finally
did escape when he had served a little over
twelve years. In March of this year, while
working with a road gang, the coming of
night before the gang had returned to the
prison offered him his opportunity, and he es-
caped, working for farmers, saving his money,
and finally reaching New York, where he se-
cured work in a storage warehouse and began
to make good.’’

One day last month his old cellmate saw
and recognized him, and compelled him to
spend the money he had earned by dint of
hard labor and economy, in a useless effort
to obtain work for his former prison associ-
ate, and to feed him while work was being
sought. When his slender means became ex-
hausted, his ‘‘evil genius’’ turned upon him,
became informer, and advised a detective of
the man’s identity, and he was immediately
arrested and taken to the Tombs prison,
where he is being held for requisition papers
for his return to the Western penitentiary.

When the facts of the case became public,
men and women all over the country who be-
lieve in fair play, flooded the governor of the
state with letters and telegrams asking ex
ecutive clemency for this man who had tried
to make good and probably would have  suc-
ceeded had it not been for the diabolical
meanness of his former cellmate.

THE UMPIRE

““THIRD DEGREE’ METHODS

Following our editorial of an earlier date,
““A Near Victim of the T.aw,”” a local paper
has taken up the subject of ‘‘third degree’’
methods, in which the writer declares that
where these methods are employed with sus-
pected criminals, they are frequently open to
the gravest abuse, and the pressure brought
to bear on the accused is of such a nature as
to be wholly contrary to the spirit of law
and fair play. :

The writer goes on to say it is one of the
first principles of law that no one is ‘‘obliged
to incriminate himself, and the officers of the
law are supposed to warn an arrested person
that any statement he makes is liable to be
used against him. To attempt to terrorize
him, in the absence of counsel to protect his
rights, into damaging admissions or confes-
sions is a plain contravention of this principle.
It is true that the police may often justly ex-
ercise extra-legal powers in the interest of
the public welfare. But this liberty is also
a responsibility. It should be employed only
with a full appreciation of the fact that, ex-
cept where the evidence is incontestable, the
presumption is of innocence, not of guilt. Tne
circumstance that the suspected person is of
known bad character should not deprive him
of every legitimate legal safeguard. In such
a case the ‘third degree’ might be justified
by the results. But it is none the less a dan-
gerous power to intrust to any body of men.

““This process of unnerving a prisoner by an
appeal to his imagination or his conscience,
his ignorance or his fear, is in essence a sur-
vival of medieval methods of torture which
modern jurisprudence has happily abandoned.
These methods existed to some extent even
in countries like England, where trial by jury
had become an established right. They sue-
ceeded the old ordeal and trial by battle, and
were accepted as a quast judicium Dei. Con-
fession was the best of all evidence, it was
held, though the witchcraft trials refuted this
assumption. Even Aristotle imputed to it
‘absolute credibility.” The third degree dces
not inflict physical pain or bind its victims to
the wheel. But the moral question involved
is much the same. The invasion of the rights
of the individual differs in degree rather than
in kind. Furthermore, no body of men, even
the sworn officers of the law, can be trusted
with extra-legal powers and not be tempted
to abuse them. Where such authority is de-
sirable it should be exercised with due re-
straint. It is at best an expedient, and it is
not in itself a substitute for law.

““These are very obvious considerations,
though they are constantly being disregarded
by the police. It is important both to punish
and to prevent crime. But that is no reason
why strong-arm practises should take the
place of intelligent investigation. It should
not be forgotten that to impress offenders of
the law with the belief that they cannot ex-
pect justice, that they have no rights which
society is bound to respect, that any means
will justify the end of punishing them, is to

make them more than ever a menace to so-
ciety. That is a truth which is too often ig-
nored, whether in vice raids or in arrests for
more or less serious crimes. The police some-
times seem to think it enough to follow the
Dogberry precedent and comprehend all va-
grom men, in the hope of discovering among
them by brutal terrorizing the real object of
their search.’’

HOPE IS NEVER WASTED

Without hope this voyaging sphere on
which man lives would be but a derelict, and
our lives empty and all but unendurable. For
hope is the great rudder to all humanity. Hope
wakens in the child even before the sense of
reason; it fills youth with golden-hued visions;
it lures maturity on to indomitable endeavor,
which is greater than mere accomplishment.
Nor does it even forsake old age. Like the
lamplight streaming through the window pane
which brought you safely home when a boy,
hope lights the path, evenunattained, it burns
unquenchable. It is more intangible than faith,
for faith is trust in what is, but hope is con-
fidence in what istobe. Even to write of it
without dropping into vague figuresis like try-
ing to express the nature of music by means of
algebraic’ symbols. Hope is sometimes the
parent of selfish ambition, but it is also the
source of all the purest and holiest passions.
It fills the heart of the father when he looks
at the baby in his arms. And when this
child has become a man the same fire burns
within as he gazes down upon his son. From
generation to generation it passes—inextin-
guishable. It makes all life like the laboratory
of the alchemist, in which what is dross seems
juston the point of being transmuted to gold.
But, like the alchemist’s toil, hope is never
wasted, for—though the phrase is hackneyed
it is what makes life worth living.

BELLS AS MONEY

““Gold and copper bells served as money
among the peoples of Mexico and Central
America before the time of the American
Indian,’’ says the Chicago FEvening Post.
““The gold bells of Costa Rica are expuisite
examples of metal work; many of them are
modeled in the form of birds, monkeys and
grotesque heads.”’

Life is an empty lamp, without the oil of love.
