THE DRUG HABIT EVIL

It is very satisfactory to note that the in-
fluential papers throughout the country are
taking up the subject of the dope habit and
its attendant evils. It is to be hoped that
good results may follow a thorough discus-
sion of this great evil and its baleful effects
upon the unfortunate victims.

This is a subject that should receive the se-
rious attention of all thoughtful citizens in-
terested in the welfare of suffering human-
ity, and means should be found whereby traf-
fic in this hellish stuff can be suppressed, or
at least be put under proper control.

Commenting on the ‘‘drug addicted’’ as
the most hopeless of all slaves of a life-de-
stroying habit, a writer in a local paper goes
on to say that ‘‘if there are fifteen thousand
such in this city, in every class of society
from high to low, they constitute a menace
to the social welfare of alarming propor-
tions. The immediate effect of opium and
its derivatives is stimulating and there is no
reason to doubt the assertion that -brilliant
intellectual work has been done under their
influence.

But the reaction is paralyzing, and the ulti-
mate result of continued use is the complete
wreck of the victim physically and morally.
There is hardly any crime on the calendar
which a ‘‘dope fiend’’ will not commit; theft,
blackmail, even murder, are familiars of his
diseased brain. The necessity of stamping
out such an evil is beyond argument,

‘“The difficulties in the way of checking its
spread alone are unfortunately great. To
prevent the open sale of these drugs accom-
plishes comparatively little. They can easily
be passed from hand to hand and disposed of
in small quantities. Moreover, those who
crave them will go to any lengths to get
them. Worst of all, they seem to be driven
by an irresistible impulse to fasten ihe habit
on others. It is a rare ‘‘dope fiend’”’ who
does not try to contaminate all his acquaint-
ances.

“Thus the evil grows in secret to an amaz-
ing extent. The venders of ‘dope’ have no

scruples. They will persuade even children
into taking it if they can. For this reason
the decision of the Supreme Court, that the
clause in the Harrison act making the posses-
sior of the drug a misdemeanor is uncon-
stitutional, however sound it may be in law,
is unsound in morals. It takes away the one
weapon that strikes at the very root of the
evil. Surely legislation not open to this ob-
Jection is possible!
that. The physicans have a responsibility
which they can not ignore. The parents must
guard their children so far as they can from
temptation. No other form of vice is a
monster of so hideous mien as the drug habit.
It should not longer be free to wreck human
lives in this state.”’

ARE YOU LOOKING AHEAD?

Some persons are constantly looking back-
ward. Some are living intensely in the pres-
ent, while others are planning and looking
forward to the future.

Retrospection with regard to certain pleas-
urable events brings rest to one’s mind, and
the review of the mistakes of yesterday fort-

‘ifies one in fighting the strenuous battles of

the present. But dreaming of the past, or
living in the present, is inadequate in properly
performing one’s life work, as one must look
ahead.

About one hundred and fifty thousand Amer-
icans before the present European war went
abroad each summer, returning in the fall.
They go over during the five months between
March and August, and expect to return be-
tween August 15th and October 1st, which is
only six weeks. Of these numbers, from
eight thousand to ten thousand returned in
the steerage because they could not get other
accommodations. Either they had spent all
their money and could not pay for cabin pass-
age, or they had negleeted to engage passage
ahead. Many others waited days and weeks
Ip order to secure passage for their return.
They knew they would want cabin passage
during these six weeks, but they failed to
look ahead.

A man engaged in business in one of the
trades or professions is strong and healthy,
and his earnings are adequate to meet the
needs of himself and family and lay a little
by to combat the proverbial rainy day. In
trying to make a good appearance among his
friends he lives up to his income, sells the
birthright of his family for a mess of pottage
in order to gratify his vanity or procrastina-
ting habits. He is strong, and the future
seems a long way off. Eventually, on account
of accident or disease, he leaves the scene of
action, and his wife and a number of small
children must face the gloomy days of the fu-
ture, unassisted by a bank account or life in.
surance policy, simply because he failed to
look ahead.

Another man lived upon the principal of his
physical bank account. He failed to bank
energy and conserve health in the form of prop-
er physical exercise and careful hygenic living,

But we need not wait for

and exacting Nature foreclosed by striking
her victim with apoplexy.

Nature is no sentimentalist, for whenever
she is outraged she will have her penalty, al-
though it take a life. She may loan you all
you want, but, like Shylock, she will fore-
close by demanding the last ounce of flesh.
She does not often annoy one with her drink
bill until one is past the prime of life, and
then presents it in the form of Bright’s dis-
ease, fatty degeneration of the heart, drunk-
ard’s liver, or some similar disease. She
does not excuse one for weakness, incompe-
tence, or ignorance, but demands that he look
ahead, that he always be at his best.

A great surgeon stood before his class to
perform a certain delicate operation. With
strong and gentle hand he performed his
work, so far as the operation was concerned,
successfully, and turned to his pupils, saying:

“Two years ago, a safe and simple opera-
tion might have cured this disease. Six years
ago a wise way of living might have prevent-
ed it. We have done our best as the case
now stands, but Nature will have her word
to say. She does not always consent to the
repeal of her capital sentences.’’

The next day the patient died.

A young man who works in a mill stopped
school when quite young. He neglected to
read or study at night, and now his hands are
tied because he failed to look ahead.

A man who is considered by the community
in which he lives as a loving husband and an
indulgent father, with a successful business
and political career to his credit, was recently
wrecked upon the rocks of immorality. Now,
at the age of fifty, his dual life is a reproach
among his associates and friends, and all be-
cause he failed to look ahead. How many a
one, having the semblance of man, is a phys-
ical, mental, or moral wreck, the ashes of a
nearly burnt-out life? Are you looking ahead?

THE MEANING OF MISFORTUNE

As a father in a garden stoops down to
kiss a child the shadows of his body fall
down upon it; so many of the dark misfor-
tunes of our life are not God going away
from us, but our Heavenly Father stooping
down to give us the kiss of His infinite and
everlasting love.

—The Lamp.
