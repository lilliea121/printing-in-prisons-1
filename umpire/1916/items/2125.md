When a man finds himself touched with fear at the thought that he can not escape the consequences of his deeds, he may remember that this applies to the pleasant consequences of good deeds as well as ‘to the painful consequences of bad ones; that he canlearn little by little, beginning with the smaller daily happenings, to live on a level from which he can look down with perfect equanimity and indifference upon both pleasant and unpleasant; and lasty, that from all circumstances, especially from painful ones, he can extract material for his growth. Nature, which is the sum-total of events everywhere, exists for the evolution and progress of souls.
