SERIOUS TROUBLE THREATENED IN CENTRAL AMERICA

U. S. Preparing to Intervene if Neededâ€”Elections to Take Place Under Guns of Warships

Serious international complications may follow the determined opposition of Costa Rica, Honduras and Salvador to the treaty recently ratified between the United States and Nicaragua.

By this treaty Nicaragua, for $3,000,000, has ceded to the United States exclusive and proprietary rights for the construction of an inter-oceanic canal across Nicaragua by way of the San Juan River and the right to maintain a naval base on the Gulf of Fonseca, on the western coast of Nicaragua, for ninety-nine years to enable this country to protect the Panama Canal.

The governments of Costa Rica, Salvador and Honduras have not only protested to this Government against the ratification of the treaty with Nicaragua, but carried their opposition to the Central American court of justice at Cartago, which has just made a decision favorable to the claims of Salvador and Costa Rica and against Nicaragua. The latter country has announced that it will not accept the decision of the court.

The election soon to be held in Nicaragua, which will mark the climax of an exciting campaign, will be held virtually under the guns of American warships, it being the intention to leave the San Diego and the Chattanooga in Nicaraguan waters indefinitely.
