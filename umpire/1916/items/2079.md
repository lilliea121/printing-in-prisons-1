CHEERING SOME ONE ON

Don't you mind about the triumphs,
Don't you worry after fame;
Don't you grieve about suceeding,
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life's the simplest, 
Love will last when wealth is gone;
Just be glad that you are living, 
And keep cheering some one on,

Let your neighbors have the blossoms,
Let your comrades wear the crown;
Never mind the little set-backs
Nor the blows that knock you down,
You'll be there when they're forgotten,
You'll be glad with youth and dawn,
If you just forget your troubles
And keep cheering some one on.

There's a lot of sorrow round you,
Lots of lonesomeness and tears;
Lots of heartache and of worry
Through the shadow of the years.
ANd the world needs more than triumphs;
More than all the swords we've drawn,
It is hungering for the fellow
Who keeps cheering others on.

Let the wind around you whistle,
And the storms around you play;
You'll be there with brawn and gristle
When the conquerors decay,
You'll be here in memories sweetened
In the souls you've saved from pawn
If you put aside the victories
And keep cheering some one on.
