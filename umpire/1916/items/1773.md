TURNED UP FORTUNE WITH PLOW

Considerable excitement was caused at Nacona, Tex., the other day when it was reported that a farmer named Palmer near there plowed up silver barson his farm estimated to be worth $100,000 to $280,000. He wili send the bars to the Denver Mint for analysis.

It is believed the silver was left there by Spaniards in th e sixteenth or seventeenth century, when thcy were forced by Indians to retreat.

Many of the owners of adjoining farms are reported as industriously engaged in making an extended search on their property in hopes of unearthing more of the precious metal.
