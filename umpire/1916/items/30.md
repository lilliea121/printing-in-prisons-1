KENTUCKY’S GOVERNOR
URGES REFORMS

Laws Advocated to Control Trusts and
Abolish Prison Labor

Governor A. Q. Stanley, in his message to
the State Legislature, which recently convened
in biennial session, advocates that a law be
enacted abolishing State prison contract labor
and the emploving of prisoners on highways,
as the State Constitution provides.

The Governor called attention to the anti-
quated system of handling prisoners, and ad-
vised that modern methods be adopted in that
State.

Governor Stanley also: recommends the en-
actment of a more adequate and stringent an-
ti-trust act; and the enactment of a corrupt
practices measure, in order that the people
may know ‘‘what amounts are spent by candi-
dates and by campaign committees for the
purpose of controlling elections.”
