Warden Kirchway Makes New Rule
To Bar Newspaper Men From
Execution Chamber

Warden Kirchway established a new rule at
executions, by the excluding of newspaper men
from the death chamber, when two prisomners
were electrocuted at Sing Sing, the other day.
Warden Kirchway, who is opposed to the
death penralty, took the position that as hewas
opposed to capital punishment he did not care
to advertise it any more than necessary, as it
had a very depressing effect upon the prisoners
and others who read the newspapers.
