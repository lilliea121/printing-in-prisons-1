THE WONDERS OF STONEHENGE Everyone has heard of Stonehenge—a prehistoric monument which is almost as much of a puzzle as the Sphinx in. Egypt, or the mounds erected by the mound-builders in America Stonehenge is about ten miles north of Salisbury, in Wiltshire, England. The name comes two Saxon words meaning stones." The earlier Celtic name was Cor Gawr or giants' temple. There are in many localities in the northwest of Europe prehistoric remains in the form of huge stone monuments or "tumull" or "barrows"—that is, bowl-shaped mounds or hills of earth. In the neighborhood of Stonehenge there are hundreds of these mounds. Coins, and many valuable relics found in them seem to date them back about three centuries before Christ. It must have taken an immense amount of work to make them, and there must have been some profound and serious purpose behind them.
