Fine Model of Ship by Inmate

In these days of electricity, steam and the gas-engine, it seems like an echo from the past to hear of sailing ships, dependent upon the uncertain winds alone to drive the vessel over its course from port to port. Still, there are a few of these old-time square-rigged ships to be found here and there, mostly much the worst for age and wear, to excite the wonderment of the novice of today.

These thoughts were vividly brought to mind recently on viewing an accurate model of a full-rigged ship lately completed by inmate B 7401 with consumate skill and perfec- tion of detail. Every working part of a ship is to be found on this model in miniature du- plicate form, showing a replete knowledge of that seaman’s art. Only one who "has gone down to the sea in ships,” could produce such a clever work of art, which is truly a revelation to the uninitiated landsman.
