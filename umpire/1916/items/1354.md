HUSTLING BALL PLAYERSLike a lot of little chickens, Following after the mother hen,After every new arrival,Is our Managers of base-ball men.Here a pitcher, there a catcher—Each manager bound to him first;Little do they mind the weather,When they get the baseball thirst.Right up to his cell they follow,Then each tells of his team;And their tongues begin to chatterTalking baseball just like steam. "Play for me," says manager Wise,"You will be glad some of the boys to meet."Then manager Hagy tells themMy team it can't be beat.So anxious are they for the players They forget they have played for cash:And when a player ask's for money,Then their joys all go "Smash."So let the managers take this warning Caution is the wisest plan;Before you sign up your playersLearn a little of your Man.—B 6861
