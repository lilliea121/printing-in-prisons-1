HIGHEST PAY FOR U. S. EMPLOYES A Washington report states that Secretary of the Navy Baker recently announced that negotiations would be undertaken with workmen of the Rock Island arsenal seeking a higher wage scale, and expressed his belief that the Goverment should lead the way as an employer and pay more than the usual wage scale. "The Goverment," said the Secretary, "should be an industrial leader, offering the employes better wages and working conditions than private employers. I believe the Government should pay a little the best wages and offer a little the best working conditions. For two reasons it should pay slightly over the usual wage scaleâ€”to secure the pick of employes and to be a model to private employers." Mr. Baker said the lab r department had been asked to advise on the arsenal wage scale, and a final answer probably will be given the workmen the latter part of May
