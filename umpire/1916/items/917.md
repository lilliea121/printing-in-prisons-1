U. S. PRISONERS TO HAVE AUTOMATIC PAROLE From the columns of Good Words, we are pleased to learn that the report relative to the proposed parole law seems to be correct. It is, in effect, that the bill seeking to provide automatic parole for first offenders upon completion of one-third of their time, is. we understand on good authority, to be introduced concurrently in the Senate and House, at this session of Congress, where it has every indication of passing. Good Luck gentlemen!
