““Big Brothers of Cherry Hill”’
Dear People:—

- Your gift came to hand to-day
and [ feel I can never fully express my thanks,
for this kindness which you have bestowed up-
on myself and little ones. It has scattered the
the gloom which has surrounded us, and at
last shows forth rays of sunlight, which now
enter our home, which is our .only comfort.
From this gift I shall properly clothe my little
ones, so they can attend both Sunday and Pub-
lic Schools and save their health. Again thank-
ing you for'this brightness to our hearts, I
earnestly pray our Father in Heaven to bestow
his blessinzs on each and every member of this
uplifting Club. I remain Truly Yours.

Phila., Pa., Dec. 30, 1915,
Editor of THE UMPIRE,
Dear Sir: :

Owing to the fact that I wasunable to
contribute toward the Children’s Christmas
Fund, and had broken the rules of the H. & F.
Club, I requested that my name be withdrawn
as a member of the same, and I did not expect
that my family would receive anything from
that source. You may imagine my surprise to
receive a letter from home stating that the
children had been remembered with a number
of useful presents by the “Big Brothers’’ of
Cherry Hill. ]

My children have written me expressing

please add my own.
May the New Year bring you all the bright-
est prospects for the future.
Very sincerely yours,

: Dec. 26, 19

“Big Brothers’’ of Cherry Hill. ‘
Dear People: -

Your packege at hand Xmas day, and I
feel words can never fully thank you for the
kindness, which you dear people bestowed upon
this home of sadness and sickness. Just this
happiness given to my little ones and_ seeing
their joy, lightened my heart for a while, for
Xmas was very sad to me, as my dear mother
was lying low with pneumonia and I with my
feeble health and worries am doing my utmost
to bring her to health again. [ care not for
myself, but for those I love. Now that my
loved one is absent, I am striving hard to keep
hunger and sickness from my door, but it has
found shelter here and my efforts seem in vain
Trusting God in Heaven will care far us all, I
leave it all to him, again thanking vou for the
kindness and asking our Father in Heaven to
bestow his blessing on ‘‘The Big Brothers of
Cherry Hill”” and give all a bright and happy
New Year. I remain,

Truly Yours.

15.
