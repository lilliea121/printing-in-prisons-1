A GIGANTIC MAP A huge map of the world drawn to the unusual scale of sixteen miles to the inch, has been in process of drawing for over six years. That a map on this huge scale should be undertaken was agreed upon by an international committee which met in London seven years ago. Each country, it was decided, would draw its own map to the scale and all the work would be done under a uniform system of symbols and signs, with the metric system employed in designating distances and altitudes and Latin characters used in place of names. The United States did not participate in the agreement, nor in one entered into later—at Brussels in 1911—when the Aeronautical Map Conference decided to make a world map on the scale of eighty miles to the inch.
