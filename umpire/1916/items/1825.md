WHEN YOU SHALL CHOOSE
Thomas F. Porter

When you shall choose the course that you would go 
To reach the goal toward which your powers bend, 
Let naught your aim and purpose over- throw, 
But, whate’er comes, press bravely to the end.
When you resolve that something you will do 
That worthy is of brain and mind and thought, 
Whoe’er opposes, still your work pursue 
Until it is to full perfection brought. 
When in your heart you something have to say 
That, if accepted, will some good bestow, 
Speek it not once but ever, day by day 
Until the worlk its worth shall come to know.
To sum up all, in every thought and deed 
Be your own self, determined, firm, intense; 
No matter who shall frown or who shall heed, 
Stand bravely up, despite the consequence.
