WORK FOR CONGRESS

The New York Sun is of the opinion that if Congress could devote the entire short session when open to the problems springing from the demand of the four brotherhoods for an eight-hour day, it would not have sufficient time to study them as they deserve. Already organized labor has declared against the legislation advocated by the President, and his recommendations will precipitate a bitter struggle. Moreover, they can not be intelligently acted on without consideration of the adverse conditicns which have crippled the transportation corporations in the past, the evil effects of which on trade and commerce are more apparent now then ever before. The distribution of foodstuffs and the maintenance of reasonable prices therefor are involved in this to an extent commonly overlooked, and this factor must receive attention.
