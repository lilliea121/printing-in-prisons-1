THE LATEST-"SPY ROCKETS"It is said that England's anxious lookout for the activities of spies extends to the heavens, where rocket-like meteors have several times been reported by special constables as "spy rockets" "One of these bodies formed the subject of a telegram in which Mrs. Fiametta, Wilson, the well-known meteor observer, asked another meteor observer, Miss Cook, whether she had seen it. The telegram was held up by the censor, but subsequently allowed to pass."
