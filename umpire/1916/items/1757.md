A WORTHY PUBLICATION

One need not extol the merits of a good word, act or deed, for they speak for themselves; and so it is with a good book or an uplifting publi- cation, no matter whether we quite agree with all the author or publisher may have to say or not, the fact that the â€˜object sought is of a higher plane than the purely materialistic and worldly, is certainly worthy of the highest com- mendation and approbation. Of such we believe The New Way, published at Point Loma, Cal., by Katharine Tingley, to be.

As we look upon the happy, spiritual faces of the children depicted on the front page of the June number of that periodical, we are impelled to express the thought that Mme. Tingley has approached nearer the truly idea- listic objective in her noble work, than have most mortals on this earthly sphere, and for that reason it affords us pleasure to extend our sincere wish for the future success The New Way.
