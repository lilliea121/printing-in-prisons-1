Torpedoboat Destroyer Makes 29.87 Knots in Test From Rockland, Me, we learn that at the trial runs of the torpedoboat destroyer Tucker were interrupted by a minor accident. After the destroyer had traveled 18 times over the measured mile course, attaining a speed of 29.87 knots, a leaky condenser tube made it necessary to postpone the top speed tests until today.
