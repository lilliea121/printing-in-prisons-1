turned to the 10 State penitentiary camps and
100 county road building forces; reporting
promptly to the wardensand overseers, thus
proving themselves worthy of the trust im-
posed in them by Governor Craigof North
Carolina. :

The officers express great satisfaction
their 1eport to Governor Craig, at the fact
that every prisoner had returned to work. Al]

cheered by their holiday and the happiness of
their fellow inmates.

1000, but only t wo slight ‘misdemeanors are re-
ported. These occurred “in Governor Craig’s

give other privileges to the pnsoners ‘as the\f
