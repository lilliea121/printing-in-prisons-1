A WARNING TO THE COURT

An editorial writer in the Boston Transcript has taken Sam Gompers to task for his anarchistic utterances in relation to the so-called eight-hour law. The writer goes on to say that ‘‘when Gompers was asked, at Baltimore recently what bearing upon the attitude of his organization toward the Adamson wage increase law the unfavorable decision of Judge Hook would have, he spurned the use of wasted words in his reply. ‘We are looking to the railroad brotherhoods,' he said, ‘to see that the eight-hour day goes into effect January 1, law or no law.’ At least the answer of this labor leader possesses the merit of conciseness and frankness. There is no escaping the mearing of his language.

‘Law or no law,’ the brotherhoods must be a law unto themselves if they are to win ‘the sanction of society’ which Mr. Gompers bestows. Nor can the Supreme Court complain that it was not warned in ample time as to the decision it must hand down if it would ‘keep us out of war’ with the brotherhoods and the organization whose privilege it is to have such a plain-speaking citizen for its president as Samuel Gompers. Intimidation won the battle of last August. ‘Why swap horses?’ ”
