THE PRESIDENT NOT LIBERAL IN GRANTING PARDONS From a late Washington report it is learned that many applications for pardons has been made to the Department of Justice within the last few months. The largest number was reached Saturday, when President Wilson sent to the Department the 46th application he has decided last week. It was denied, as were many others. Only seven were approved. In President Roosevelt's second term 803 applications were filed, an average of 201 a year. President Taft considered 1184 applications In the three years of President Wilson's term he has considered over 900. In reviewing the cases considered by President Wilson, it seems that clemency has been shown to about one-fourth. President Taft pardoned or commuted the sentences of 70 per cent. Of those who asked for clemency, and President Roosevelt about 60 per cent. This would indicate that President Wilson's policy is to grant but few pardons during his term.
