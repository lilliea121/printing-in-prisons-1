SPARKS

Tact and deciet both end in t, but their origin and the end they work for are different.

If you ask others to stoop to our prejudices, let us not blame them if they lose their upright- ness.

If the most difficult parts of a certain work appeal to you, it is a good sign that you are fitted for that work

A false accusation may harm, but it is the true one that hurts.

Submit to oppression and you become a partner in its perpetuation.
