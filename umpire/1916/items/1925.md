TOO LATE

It is never too late.

Of all the fear-forged lies that shackle the human spirit-one of the cruelest is implied in those two words: “Too late!”

Among souls nothing is irrevocable.

We men and women who are alive live about on this earth, little glowing sparks of divinity.

There is no rain of circumstance that can put us out. There is no iron heel of catastrophe or malice that can cover and crush us.

If I have wasted my youth,—well, I have yet my life, which still can be shaved to my will. If I have missed an education in the proper schools, the school of days is always open, the school of spare hours, of running time; I will attend, with myself as master indomitable, with myself as insatiable pupil.

What are habits? I make them. I can break them. If it hurts I will not whimper. I will take myself in hand.

All about the walls of my room I will write: “I can. I can. I can. I can”

I will not weep, nor go with those who weep, over lost opportunities. For every opportunity lost I can find ten new ones.

Said Oliver Schriner: ‘‘It is never too late for the soul of man.”

— Dr. Frank Crane.
