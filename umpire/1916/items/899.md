title: "A SINGING HEART \vBy Roscoe G. Stott \vOh, for a singing heart within my breast
  That in the stifled. sordid grind of all Life's common place, where petty cares
  hold thrall, My soul may throb with melody serene' and blest; Or, bursting into
  some full chant of Hope, Its notes may break the stillness of the night For some,
  who, weeping in their sorry plight, With all their bitter griefs but poorly cope.
  Be mine a singing heart that thrills and cheers; That wakes a counter melody; that
  lifts To skyward from the murky passion-drifts; That lights the eye self-blinded
  by its tears. Be mine a singing heart, whose anthem floats With God's pure sunshine
  woven through its notes. "

A SINGING HEART By Roscoe G. Stott Oh, for a singing heart within my breast That in the stifled. sordid grind of all Life's common place, where petty cares hold thrall, My soul may throb with melody serene' and blest; Or, bursting into some full chant of Hope, Its notes may break the stillness of the night For some, who, weeping in their sorry plight, With all their bitter griefs but poorly cope. Be mine a singing h-art that thrills and cheers; That wakes a counter melody; that lifts To skyward from the murky passion-drifts; That lights the eye self-blinded by its tears. Be mine a singing heart, whose anthem floats With God's pure sunshine woven through its notes.
