STATE OF WAR NOW EXISTS IN MEXICO

It is admitted at the State Department at Washington that a ‘‘constructive’’state of war, in which the United States is involved, exists in Mexico. It was contended that there was no condition of hostilitiesbetween the American and Mexican Governments, but merely that through the presence of United States troops on Mexican territory engaged in military operations against a certain Mexican citizen—meaning Francisco Villa and his armed followers—war conditions prevail.

The situation is likened to that in China during the Boxer troubles of 1900, when troops of the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Russia, France, Austria, Japan and some other nations engaged in hostile operations against armed forces of Chinese which were in revolt against the Chinese Government. No war between these nations and the Chinese Government was declared, but some years later the War Department made the ruling that a state of war involving the United States had existed during the operations of American troops against the Boxers.

The position of the State Department is in line with an opinion rendered by Brigadier-General Crowder, judge advocate general of the army, that offenses, which in the United States would be tried in civil criminal courts, committed by American soldiers with the expeditionary force in Mexico, shall be tried by military courts, as it is a ‘‘time of war’’ in Mexico within the meaning of the United States military statutes.
