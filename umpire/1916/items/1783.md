HELP A FELLOW FORWARD 
By Denis A. McCarthy

Help a follow forward, man;
Help a fellow all you can,
When he’s out of step and slow, 
Courage gone, and can’t say’ No,”’ 
When despair comes sneaking in, 
When he feels he cannot win,
And you know a little bit
More of that and he must quit— 
Will you, heedless of his plight, 
Forge ahead with all your might? 
Will you take the lead, nor mind 
This poor struggler left behind? 
Nay; I’m sure you’ll stop awhile— 
Stop to help him with a smile, 
Stop to lend a hand to him
Who is up against the grim 
Problem that we all must face 
Somewhere in life's eager race.

Help a fellow forward! 
Say Something cheering, something gay, 
Something that will stir his soul, 
Wake his will and self control. 
Bravest hearts will sometimes fail, 
Strongest spirits sometimes quail; 
And a friendly word of cheer.
Oft transforms a whole career. 
Have you not vourself been stirred 
In the past by some good word
To a stronger effort still
As you climbed the weary hill?
So, whene’er you see another 
Losing hope —well, he’s a brother, 
And a word, a deed, is due
To that brother-man from you. 
Help him! It is Christ’s own plan! 
Help a fellow all you can!
