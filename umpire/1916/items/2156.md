PERSHINGâ€™S FORCES IN MEXICO

Always alive to the momentous questions of the times, the New York Herald, in refering to the uselessness of the United States troops stationed in Mexico, states that the Pershing expedition is protecting nobody. Americans in Mexico are being slaughtered just as blithely as if that force did not exist, In no sense is it a repressive influence upon fratricidal strife between Mexican factions. Its presence upon Mexican soil is a constant aggravation to the de facto government with which the Government at Washington is maintaining friendly relations and endeavoring to do business. At the same time its helplessness, misunderstood and misconstrued, is adding daily to the contempt in which the masses of Mexicans hold the Unit- el States and the American people. Every consideration of common sense and national interest demands an end to this farce. The sooner the better!
