Actually Refusing BusinessAccording to a local paper the great shipyards in this neighborhood are turning down orders, because contracts already in hand will keep their greatly augmented forces working at top notch speed for the next two or more years. The statement is that the contracts in hand approximate far above $50,000,000. The contracts include battleship and torpedo boats for the United States government; a large number of oil tankers; some freight vessels and some passengers steamships; and most of the ships, it is said, are destined to fly the American flag. All of which has a cheerful sound, and we trust that the orders which have been turned down at Philadelphia will turn up and be welcomed in other American shipyards from Maine to California.
