THE CAPTIVE'S SONG

The habit of the thistle-bird, which always sings persistently when in trouble of any sort, is a good thing to imitate. A gentleman living in the village of Silver Creek, Nebraska, had heard under his window, for many successive days, the persistent song of one of those little birds, and finally called the song to the attention of a naturalist friend who constantly studied birds and their ways. Upon investigating the source of the notes, the friend discovered that the thistle-bird was a captive in its nest. A ladder was brought, and bird and nest were taken down for examination.

One leg of the little prisoner had become entangled in the wool which formed the nest’s lining, and it took twenty minutes of painstaking effort before the leg was freed. When this was done, the spectators were greatly surprised to see the bird fly away, a trifle unsteadily but apparently not at all injured. The bird’s parents or some of its feathered friends had kept it supplied with food during its captivity. But the remarkable part of the story is that its habit of singing was the cause of its release.
