CAMDEN'S INDUSTRIAL AND CIVIC EXPOSITIONFollowing the example of Philadelphia, Camden opened its doors to an extensive Civic Celebration and Industrial Exposition at the Third Regiment Armory in that city last week Thursday.The exposition is mainly for the purpose of emphasizing Camden's industrial greatness and the fact that the city has attained a population of over 100,000.Something over one hundred lines of Camden's varied industries are shown, and the exhibits are the best ever seen in that city. The leading displays were by the N.Y. Shipbuilding Co., said to be the largest of its class in in the world; The Victor Talking Machine Co., the Joseph Campbell Co., the Esterbrook Steel Pen Co., the Camden Glass Pottery Co. and the Camden Cut Glass Co. Judging from all reports Camden may will fell proud of the industrial display now under way.
