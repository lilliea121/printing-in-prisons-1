PORTABLE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH A very interesting mobile wireless telegraph equipment is being used by the British army. Four horses carry the equipment. On one is packed the power plant, another carries the receiving apparatus, a third horse bears the transmitting apparatus, while the mast and accessories are loaded upon the fourth horse. The power plant is particularly interesting. The design of the saddle is such as to form a support for the plant. On one side is mounted a generator and on the other a small gasoline engine. After the saddle has been lifted off the horse and placed on the ground, the engine and the generator are connected by a shaft. It takes but a moment to prepare the plant for work.
