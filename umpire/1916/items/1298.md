ANOTHER RELIC OF THE PAST ABOLISHED The prisoners' dock which has been in use for years in the Quarter Sessions Court, in the trials of criminal cases, has been removed by order of Judge Bregy. Hereafter defendants will sit with their counsel, guarded by two court officers. The removal was caused by the opinion that the use of the dock was not fair to the defendants. For several years there has been a g owing realization that the dock prejudiced the cases â€˜of the prisoners. More than year ago a lawyer obtained a decision from the Supreme Court upholding a contention that a prisoner was entitled to sit beside counsel during the trail of his case.
