Chorus Oh your boy is saved tonight Oh your boy is saved tonight He is freed from sin, He now loves you again Oh your boy is saved tonight. At last I've given myself. to Christ. Weary. and sick of sin I've opened wide my wretched heart And let the Saviour in. So long I prayed, but prayed in doubt That my Lora might forgive my sins That Christ would save me as I was And cleanse my guilty stains. My prayer was heard, So now I'll live for Him Who died that you and all mankind May ever dwell in Heaven. my sins forgiven Now you who have heard this joyful news Of one once lost in sin Accept His Grace, believe His Word. And live as unto Him.
