STATE BUREAU MAKES RECORDâ€” 1688 JOBS SECURED IN MONTH

Harrisburg reports assert that during October, 1688 Pennsylvanians who were out of work, or dissatisfied with the positions they held, obtained work through the bureau of employment of the State Department of labor and industry. This was about 60 per cent. of the persons who sought work and of the number of employes sought by employers.

The Philadelphia branch, naturally, holds first place, according to figures made public recently by Dr. John Price Jackson, the state commissioner of labor and industry, with Pittsburg, Harrisburg, Johnstown ard Altoona following. In Philadelphia there were 437 requests for employes, 1317 requests for positions, 1121 applicants referred and 946 positions filled.
