CATHOLIC FIELD MASS AT PHILADELPHIA NAVY YARDMilitary field mass, one of the most imposing service of the Catholic Church, was celebrated at Philadelphia Navy Yard on Sunday last. The ceremonies were conducted under the auspices of the Army and Navy Union, and over 3,000 members of military and civic organizations passed in review before the mass, while over 30,000 others thronged the plaza of the navy yard. The sermon was delivered by the Rt. Rev. Dr. Drumgool, his theme being a plea for a peach founded on justice and truth. The mass was celebrated by the Rev. Thomas J. Ryan, assisted by the Rev. William J, Lallou, and the Rev. William J. Casey.There was a vast multitude of people present and the National Papal colors were everywhere in evidence.
