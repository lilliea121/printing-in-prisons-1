THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR The editor of a local paper evidently sees great possibilities ahead for the U S. dollar exchange with South American countries. Commenting on the situation he says, that "the campaign to put the American dollar mark on the world map is progressing admirably. Reports from Bolivia, Peru, and Chili indicate that the governments of those countries will officially sanction the change from pounds sterling to dollars in international exchange. If they do that, it will be of immediate service to United States business, Dollar exchange will permit our companies doing business in South America to save time and money, as well as a great deal of red tape. A number of individual mining concerns in Chili are already using dollars as a basis of exchange, thus eliminating a century-old custom of making London the financial clearing house for the world. This is one directing results of the war, and if our United States bankers can offer to South American business men all the facilities and credit which heretofore the latter have obtained from England, France and Germany, the dollar mark ought to remain permanently imprinted upon that equatorial continent."
