ISLANDERS ANXIOUS TO COME UNDER AMERICAN FLAG

Reports from St. Thomas, D. W. L, announce that in a resolution recently adopted, the local Legislature urged upon the Danish Government the expediting of the negotiations for the sale of the Danish West Indies to the United States. The resolution says:

"As constantly recurring sale negotiations paralyze all enterprises in St. Thomas, and great depression, with a public deficit and private misery, has already been caused by the war and by disappointment from the Panama Canal, the mother country is earnestly requested to hasten the present negotiations and implored not to reject the sale unless the entire nation demands it and is willing to take the consequences afterward.’’

The resolutions, which were adopted unanimously, were cabled to the Finance Minister at Copenhagen.
