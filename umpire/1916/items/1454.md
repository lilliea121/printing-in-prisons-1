Through the publication of his photograph and the story of his experiences in the finding of a wrecked German Zepplin, William Martin, skipper of a British steam trawler, has been reunited with his only living blood relative, a sister living in Birmingham. They have not seen or heard of each other for fifteen years until the sister saw the photograph and read the account of the skipper's adventure.
