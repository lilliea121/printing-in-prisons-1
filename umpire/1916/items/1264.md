The story is told that there was a bad accident in the street of a big city. A surgeon happened to be at the spot and was soon rendering first aid. He did not have his medicine-kit with him. He needed something and needed it quickly. "Boy," he said to a youngster in it the crowd, "hand me that string out of your pocket." And the string was forthcoming. "How did you know that boy had a string in his pocket?" asked a spectator later. "Why, every real boy carries string in his pocket." said the surgeon.
