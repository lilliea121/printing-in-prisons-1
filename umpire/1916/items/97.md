PRISON LABOR TO PROFIT BY
$75,000 FUND

A late report from Harrisburg states that
Attorney General Brown has given an opinion
to the new State Prison Labor Commissicn
that it may draw upon a $75,000 appropriation
made to it under the name of the ‘‘manufac-
turing Fund,’’ for operation of the new prison
labor system by which convicts will be paid
for their labor. A question had been raised
by the Auditor General whether the act could
be construed to carry such appropriation.

A meeting of S. P. L. Commission is expected
to take place shortly, when the wage schedule
will be decided upon. :
