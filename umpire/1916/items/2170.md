WAR COMPENSATIONS

A writer in the Cincinnati Times-Star believes that the present war in Europe will eventually have its compensations, which seems rather hard to believe, in view of the frightful sacrifice of lives. Undoubtedly the war is working a stupendous change in industrial methods. Forced by necessity, chemists and inventors are devoting their energies to the discovery of "something just as good.‚Äù Most of all, in Germany scientists are bending their energies to make up the deficiencies which are inevitable to a condition of blockade. After the war is over it will be found that new uses have been found for many of the waste products of the earth. Just as the slag pile and the refuse from the smelter, the iron furnace and the coke and charcoal ovens have been turned to good account, so will the fields and marshes soon be contributing to the welfare of man in new and unexpected ways.
