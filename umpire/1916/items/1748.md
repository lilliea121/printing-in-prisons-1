MUNITIONS INQUIRY ASKED FOR

From a Washington report it is learned that Representative William A. Rodenberg, of IlIinois, Republican, who lately insinuated in the House that the State Department had permitted the shipment of munitions of war into Mexico in April as a result of a visit to the department by Cleveland H. Dodge, of New York, offered a resolution for an investigation by Congress of all ammunition shipments into Mexico since the Taft administration." The resolution calls particularly for information as to whether any contributor to the Democratic campaign fund has shipped ammunition to the Mexicans.
