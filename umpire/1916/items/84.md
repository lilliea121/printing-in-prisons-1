CITY HALL CCURT TO BE
CLEARED OF «RUNNERS”

Sharpers, “Cop Detectives” And Other
Undesirables To Be Kept Out

A change for the better was recntly made
at the City Hall, when the corridor leading to
the police court on the sixth floor was cleared
by reserve policemen of the veritable mob of
“runners’’ for lawyers and professional bail
goers and ‘‘cop detectives.”’ : v

The policemen, acting under the orders of
Captain Mills, of the new traffic division,
threatened the ‘‘runners’” with arrest il they
returned to the building. Most of the *‘runners’’
hurried away, but the more hardened ones,
who boasted of the ‘‘political pulls’”’ of the
lawyers employing them, threatened te seper-
ate the policeman from their jobs. ‘Captain
Mills gave them cold comfort. _ ‘ 5

“I am going to stop these’ “rinners from
hanging around the building,”’” he said, ‘‘and
have given orders to the City Hall guards to
keep them out. | have no intention of inter-
fering with respectable lawyers,but their ‘‘help-
ers’’ will not be permitted to prey on unfort-
unates.”’ j ;

Captain Mills explained that the ‘‘cop de-
tective”’ constituted a new class of sharpers,
whao  “‘spotted’ detectives, particularly vice
squad men, in police court, and ‘“‘tipped them
off’”” when they appeared in the Tenderloin.

Acting detective Palmer was cut on the head
and face by a negro woman about a week ago,
as the result of a ‘“‘tip’’ given by one of these
‘‘cop detectives.’’
