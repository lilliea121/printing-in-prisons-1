OUR ELECTORAL WEAKNESS

The Louisville Courier-Journal does not think well of our electoral system and says:

“That if in the face of a storm of unexampled fury the passengers on an ocean liner should seize the ship and at the height of the tempest change the captain on the bridge—replacing a veteran with a novice—would it not seem a species of insanity as well as a sure aggravation of danger? The weakness of our electoral system is illustrated by such a possibility in what may be called our political navigation. At no juncture of our national history has party spirit shown itself so unreflecting—shall we not say so unpatriotic—as seriously to contemplate an act so fraught with peril to the State.”
