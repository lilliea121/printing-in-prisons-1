NEW HOTEL TO COST $9,000,000

It is announced in a New York report that in another month the mammoth $9,000,000 hotel planned in the terminal area by the New York Central Railroad for John McE. Bowman, proprietor of the Biltmore and Manhat- tan Hotels, will be under way.

The proposed hotel will rise to a height of twenty-eight stories, and when completed will be the largest and tallest hostelry in the world. It is to be known as the ‘‘Commodore,’’ after Commodore Vanderbilt, founder of the New York Central lines, and will contain upward of 2000 rooms.

It has been estimated that upward of 15,000 tons of fabricated steel will be used, the cost of which will approximate $6,000,000.
