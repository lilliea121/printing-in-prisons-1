JOSEPH T. MOON

We regret to record the passing away of Joseph T. Moon, on Saturday last, who has been a constant visitor to this institution for a number of years past. His faithful service will be gratefully remembered by those to whom he gave encouragement in their hour of trouble.

In his death the Salvation Army loses a sincere and faithful officer, whose place in that body will not be easily filled.

We extend our sincere condolence to the family and friends of the deceased.
