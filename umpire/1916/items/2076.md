A WORD ABOUT GOATS

Evidently a writer in the Chicago Journal has a high opinion of goat meat, as he says that “the traveler in New Mexico, Arizona and many other parts of the Southwest has no trouble in getting 'lamb chops' and ‘roast mutton,’ and no fault to find with the quality of the meat served under’ these names. Yet much of the time he is eating goat meat —and liking it. Offered under its proper name it would be rejected with scorn, but only the title needs’ disguise. The meat itself is delicious. Now, goats can be raised much more easily than sheep, and will produce more meat to the acre than any other animals except possibly swine. The chief thing that keeps their numbers down is prejudice.
