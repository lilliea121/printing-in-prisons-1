UNEMPLOYED PLOBLEM SOLVED

The city.of Lynn., Massachusetts, has a pub-
lic forest of about.2,000 acres. It was recently
decided to help the unemployed by clearing up
this forest.  An appropriation of $ 20,000 was
made and 200 men set to work. In order fo
keep them at work when the appropriation
hecame exhausted, a campaign called the ‘“By-
a-cord-of-wood”” movement was started, and
proved quite successful. This practical aid for
the uremployed might wel] be adopted, with
variations, by other wide awake communities.
