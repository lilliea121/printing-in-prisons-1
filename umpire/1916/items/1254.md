SUSPICIOUS OF THE U. S. A special correspondent of one of the leading periodicals of this country called. upon President Porras, of Panama, for the purpose of an interview, at which time he is reported to have said that the Panamans are distrustful of the present position they occupy in the world and would like to see the Panama canal neutralized and placed under the joint control and protection of four or more great world powers. They want the canal fortified, the president said, for they understand that "if it were shelled Panama City and Colon would be destroyed by the first shots," yet they consider that their growth and prosperity are endangered by the process of fortifying the waterway. He pointed out for example, that though railroads running out of both Colon and Panama City are badly needed, the United States will not construct such roads because of the possibility of their being used by an enemy. President Porras spoke of a suggestion which has been made of placing the Panama canal, the Suez canal and similar waterways under the joint control and protection of four great powers, and said that though the proposal seems impossible, he believes it would appeal strongly to the people of Panama.
