REVISED JUDGEMENT By Roy Temple House When I was somewhat younger I opined (â€˜Twas what they always taught me as a lad) The two great classes of our mankind Were these: good men and bad I've touched men in a thousand ways since then, Sometimes as creditor, sometimes as debtor; And I have found the two great types of men To be: good men and better.
