SAGE LEAVES

Retter a hundred refusals to a prisoner’s request than one unfulfilled promise.

A writer says that men should not be trusted beyond their ‘‘greatest weakness.” In some men that is about all one is able to find.

There are some things worse than prison. For instance, a woman with a peacock brain and the tongue of an adder.

A local paper states that policemen will be exempt from campaign contributions. Good! But no one has said anything against their ability as collectors.

For goodness’ sake let us hear a little more about the glory of God, and less about the sinner and punishment.

There are lots of ups and downs through life, but the downs move with ten times the velocity of the ups. 

Governor Brumbaugh says ‘‘that only five per cent. of the young women of today are able to cook eggs or bake bread.” Perhaps that may account for the popularity of the divorce court and the quick lunch counter.
