A FABLE OF AESOP

It is an unfoitunate condition of mind of
many that they seek to have their wishes grati-
fied by the use of force or a mean spirit
of aggres ivenes , when a few words spoken
in a request, or a slight explanstion made
would be fully aseffective in securing the reali-
zation of their desires We recall to mind a
fable of Aesop which illustrates this:

A dispute once arose between the Wind and
the Sun, which was the stronger of the tw., and
they agreed to put the point upon this issue,
that whichever soonest made a traveller take off
his cloak, should be accouiited the more power-
ful. The Wind began, and blew with all his
might and main a blast, cold and fierce as a
Thrician storm; but the stronger he blew the
closer the traveller wrapped his cloak around
him, the tighter he grasped it with his hands,
Then out broke the Sun; with his welcome
beams he dispersed the vapor and the ccld; the
traveller felt the genial warmth, and as the
Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down,
overcome with the heat, #nd cast his cloak on
the ground. ;

Moral. Persuasion is better than force, and
the sunshine of a kind aud gentle ma ner will
sooner lay op¢n a poor m. n’s heart than all the
threatenings and fo.ce of blustering authority
