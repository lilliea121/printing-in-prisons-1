OUR HONOR CLUB Our Honor Club's progressing, T'is gaining day by day; Its influence is spreading, Good cheer in many a way. It helps the sick and weary, Brings smiles, instead of tears. Gives many pleasant hours, Thus—shortens weary years. Its deeds indeed, are golden, Its thoughts are pure and white; It helps many a weary wanderer, Through many a stormy night. Many good, hard dollars, It slips into the hand; That otherwise would be empty, Were it not for our Honor Band. So, comrades, be ye cheerful! Thy deeds are not untold— And be ye ever faithtul, To our colors—White and Gold. Rep. Del. B 5602.
