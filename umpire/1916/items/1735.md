In More Money* we recognize a unique publication that is pleasant to receive, and which causes the heart to throb with a feeling of joy akin to the little boy who has found a new toy to amuse his moments in passing. Truly, Chauncy, you’ve passed the green over to us in a very taking manner, though it doesn’t bear the government stamp as yet. Perhaps that may follow later. At any rate we hope so, for to judge from your facetious verbosity, you are the right sort and ought to grow,—to grow in the good will of your contemporaries and brother worms. 
Editor.
