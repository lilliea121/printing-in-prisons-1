Jesus said, ‘‘Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God.” Mark X. 14.

Won’t you help to fill the stockings 
Of the little ones at home,
That by the fire-side will be hanging, 
The way you used to hang your own?

Don’t you remember how you did it, 
When you were a little tot,
On the night before Christmas,
It can not be you have forgot?

So, dear comrades, let’s get busy, 
And make this Xmas one of joy; 
Every penny that you give us, 
Will help to buy some kid a toy. 

Patient mother, she will bless you, 
Fallen father will do the same; 
Though their hearts are deep in sorrow, 
And their heads are bowed with shame. 

Just think of the smiling faces, 
Of the laughter and the joy; 
There will be on Christmas morning, 
When each kiddie gets their toy.
