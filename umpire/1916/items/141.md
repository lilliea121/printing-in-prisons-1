IMPROVED LIGHTING SYSTEM
SAID TO BEAT DAYLIGHT

The Illuminating Engineers roiét}f of
which Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz is president,
has just opened their i0tn annual convention
at the Engineering Building in New York city.

L. B Marks, the first president of the society
said the country’s lighting bill had incuniéed
by leaps and bounds, an(llq now estlmate(] at
$1,000,000,000 a year.’

A interesting announcemcnt bv Mr ‘Marks
was that the engineers had “been. dble ta 1m-
prove on daylight.

“I*olluvnnu the improvement of ldmps ’. he
said, ‘“‘progress has been made in the produc-
tion of artificial davllght on a peculiar though
limited scale. We are no longer dependent
upon the sun for daylight quality of illumina-
tion; in some classes of work where fine color
discrimination is vital, as in dye w orks, for ex-
ample, we have actually improved upon day—
light umdltlons because our artificial daylight
is of the same quallt\ as the natural light and
is absolutely constant and available 24 hours a
day. Art galleries may be equipped with light-
ing facilities to exhibit paintings in artificial
daylight, an achievement which the artist hds
tong desired.” <%
