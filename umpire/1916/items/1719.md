EXPENDITURE OF $700,000,000 FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE

Vast Sum Exceeds House Figure—Dependent Families to be Taken Care of

The enormous sum of $700,000,000 is to be expended for national defense in the fiscal year of 1917, if the senate bills just passed, become operative by the President’s approval.

This stupendous total for preparedness may be subject to revision, however, because the army bill will follow the navy bill into confer- ence, where reductions are probable, despite the firm attitude of President Wilson, in supporting the liberal response of the senate to the call for adequate defense.

The appropriations for preparedness as they stand at present are as follows: Army, $313, 970,447.10; Navy, $315,826,843.55; Fortifications, $25,748,050; Military academy, $2,238, 328.57; Army and Navy deficiency, $27,559 348.05; making a total of $685,343,017.27 in all.

The army bill, as it passed the senate, ex- ceeds the appropriations made by the house by more than $131,000,000. In the final hour of debate on the measure the senate agreed to an appropriation of $2,000,000 for the relief of dependent families of National Guardsmen and regular army soldiers in service in the Mexican campaign. Ways for the distribution of the fund is left to the discretion of the secretary of war, but in no case is any dependent family to receive more than $50 per month, which would seem sufficient to meet the needs of present conditions.
