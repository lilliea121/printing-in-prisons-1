CHILDREN'S CHRISTMAS FUND In the following issue we will print the numbers of the inmates of this institution who in kindly spirit gave their offering to help make a Christmas for the kiddies that might otherwise have been neglected, owing the. plight of their fathers incarceration here, and their inability to provide the much desired cheer for the innocent and loved ones. The "Big Brother'? movement was a complete success in so far as that all were provided for whose needs were made known to those in charge of the matter, and the many expressions of thanks to be heard from various persons would seem to be indicative of sincere gratitude on their part for the remembrance from the warm hearted men "Cherry Hill." To everyone who contributed toward making this Children's Fund a success, we extend the happiest felicitations for the New Year, and without doubt they will be many times rewarded for their generosity in ways that should prove most gratifying to them. There were two hundred and thirty three children provided. for, which is nearly twice the number that received presents the year previous. Twenty two infants at the "Sheltering Arms' Mission, also received a generous package from the "Big Brothers" of "Cherry Hill." "And now abideth faith, hope and charity, these three; but the greatest of these is Charity.' And charity means Love.
