A PRAYER

Let me be a little kinder,
Let me be a little blinder
To the faults of those about me, 
Let me praise a little more;
Let me be when I am weary 
Just a little bit more cheery— 
Let me serve a little better 
Those that I am striving for.

Let me be a little braver
When temptation bids me waver. 
Let me strive a little harder
To be all that I should be;
Let me be a little meeker,
With the brother who is weaker, 
Let me think more of my neighbor 
And a little less of me.

Let me be a little sweeter— 
Make my life a bit completer, 
By doing what I should do, 
Every minute of the day. 
Let me toil without complaining, 
Not a humble task disdaining; 
Let me face the summons calmly 
When death beckons me away.
