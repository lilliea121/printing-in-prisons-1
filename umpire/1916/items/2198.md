Monarch

I am the real ruler of the universe. I cover with dust the masterpieces of the earth. Ancient forms shrink before my ever-awakening presence.

And memory cowers. Men bow before my scepter like slaves of the light. And women, their eyes fixed by my spell, follow where I lead. The puny baby in the nursery and the gray-bearded patriarch alike hearken to my magic voice. I paint the earth with divers colors, and the scientist, the doctor, all the rulers of man, awake to do my bidding.

I am the monarch of all I survey. None disputes my eternal majesty. My name is Novelty.
