According to a recent statement of Sir Eric Swayne, Director of Recruiting, North of Eng- land, Germany has still from nine to ten mill- lion men between the ages of eighteen and forty- five on which to draw for the army. He ad- mits that large numbers of these are physically unfit for service and large numbers of others must be required as skilled munition workers; but he believes Germany must still have many millions of men who can be enlisted and train- ed. In view of this fact,if fact it be, Sir Eric Swayne affirms that Great Britian must enlist 3,000,000 more men by the Spring if the allies are to make sure of success.
