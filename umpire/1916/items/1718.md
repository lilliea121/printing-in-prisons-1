DISASTEROUS EXPLOSION IN NEW YORK BAY

A terrific explosion that was heard for miles around and caused great destruction occurred at the plant of the National Storage Co., on Black Tom Island, in New York harbor, early Sunday moring.

The casualties recorded place the number of dead at five, with several others among thirty- five who were taken to hospitals, probably fatally injured. From fifteen to twenty persons were reported missing, and some are be- lieved to be dead.

The force of the explosion shook Manhattan Island like an earthquake. The shock was felt in several states, and earth tremors reach- ed as far as Philadelphia.

"It is estimated that the property damaged will exceed $50,000,000; thirteen of the twenty- four warehouses of the National Storage Co., were destroyed.

The immigrant station on Ellis Island, and the Statute of Liberty on Bedloeâ€™s Island, were Lombarded by shrapnel as large shells caught fire and exploded.

It is reported that several officers of the National Storage Co., have been placed under arrest charged with manslaughter, and violation of the laws of New Jersey.
