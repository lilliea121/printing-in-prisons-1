AQUATIC FOOD PLANTS The collections of aquatic food plants secured in a recent expedition to China are of special interest. These include water chestnuts, water nuts, and a number of aquatic bulbs, as well as the water bamboo. The Chinese, the department's explorer found, have mastered through centuries of experiments the process of using swamp lands for the raising of food crops, and their success is believed to point to commercial possibilities for some of our swamp regions where reclamation by drainage is not practicable. The kauba, sometimes called wild rive or water bamboo, now to be made the subject of experiment, is a vegetable in taste somewhat between grass and asparagus. The swollen stalks of the plant are eaten much like our asparagus The ordinary bamboo, contrary to the prevailing opinion, is not an aquatic plant and for successful cultivation calls for fertile and well-drained soil.
