PHILADELPHIA TO HAVE AN ILLUMINATED TOWER Officials of the Bureau of City Property advertised last week for bids on guilding the City Hall tower. Whether it shall be a golden or silver hue well depend upon the decision of the Art Jury. Chief McLaughlin of the Electrical Bureau, is arranging for the illumination of the tower for the convention of the Advertising Clubs of the World, to be held here in June. The painting of the tower and statue with a solution of aluminum would greatly increase the brilliancy of the illumination. Charles Curtis Harrison said the Art Jury had reached no decision.
