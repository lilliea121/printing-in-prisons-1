U. S. PRISONERS TO HAVE
AUTOMATIC PAROLE

From the columns of Good Words, we are
pleased to learn that the report relative to the
proposed parole law seems to be correct. It is,
in effect, that the bill seeking to provide auto-
matic parole for first offenders upon completion
of one-third of their time, is. we understand on
good authority, to be introduced concurrently
in the Senate and House, at this session of Con-
gress, where it has every indication of passing.
Good Luck gentlemen!
