Food Exports Last Year Was
$1,000,000,000

Export figures made public lately by the De-
partment of Commerce at Washington D C.,
show that as a result of the war, Europeâ€™s 1915-
food bill in the United States approached one
billion dollars. Records for eleven months end-

_ing December 1, indicate that more than $800,-
000,000 worth of food left American shores dur-
ing the year, nearly three times as much as in
1913, the year before war began.-

Food exports began to grow soon after war
was declared, and the last six months of 1914
saw bread shipments alone reach the value of
$300,000,000, five times the value of shipments
during the six months preceeding the war.
Last vear bread shipments passed the $500,-
000,000 mark.
