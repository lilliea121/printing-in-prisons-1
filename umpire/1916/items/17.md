BREAD CAST UPON THE WATERS

““The esteem of one’s fellow men is a thing
everyone wants. And this, too, is marked with
a price in plain figures. It is indicated in the
maxim: He who would have friends must
show himself friendly.

To make others love you there is no other
recipe than for you to love them. :

You get from the world just about the love
and good-will you put into it It is.  easy to
criticise and to see unlovable qualities in folks.
Give yourself up te this tendency and you dis-
cover sooner or later that men regard you, too,
with an unamable eye.

But encourage good and kindly judgements,
look for the admirable qualitiesin all you meet,
be loyal and loving yourself and this bread you
have cast upon the waters shall surely return to
y()u ;
