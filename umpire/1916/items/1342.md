HOMER'S BIRTHPLACEChois, where a torpedo boat the other day was destroyed, is the most probable birthplace of Homer, and shows the bline bard's cradle, schoolhouse, and tomb. Of the "twelve cities which, claimed the Homer Dead, through which the living Homer begged his bread," it is generally believed that Chios deserves the immortal honor. Although almost exterminated by the terrible massacre of 1822, the people of Chois are the most prosperous in the Levant. Nearly all leading Greek bankers and merchants hail from this island. The intellectual genius of the past reached its climax in Homer. Of few men who have ever lived can it be more truly said: "He being dead yet speaketh."
