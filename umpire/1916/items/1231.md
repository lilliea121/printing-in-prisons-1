A WONDERFUL DEVICE It is likely that most of us have at some time been in a jeweler's shop and have noticed the hundreds and hundreds of the watches hanging on the walls there, some have been repaired and some waiting to be repaired, and all of them crying to be wound up every day. And winding up six or seven hundred watches would take almost a whole dayâ€”think of that! So what do you suppose has been invented? A WATCH-WINDING MACHINE. It is an electrical device and does all the work in less than no time. "A small motor, transmitting its power by friction, drives a shaft at the end of which is a socket to hold the stem of the watch. The watchmaker simply holds the stem in the socket. presses hard enough to engage the friction wheels and the motor does the rest. When the watch is wound the tightened spring overcomes the friction and the motor is disengaged."
