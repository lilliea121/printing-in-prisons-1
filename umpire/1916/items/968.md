H. & F. CLUB NOTES The entertainment of last Saturday was a huge success, and judging from the applause given, it was very much appreciated by the boys. We have other good acts to put on later, with plenty of music, and songs; but we would like to hear from any member who may be able to do a trick, sing a song, or play an instrument, as we want all the performers we can get to help keep the ball a rolling, so if anyone can do a good stunt, send your number in to and the entertainment committee will call on you; they can help you to perfect your act. We have other surprises, in the way of reading matter etc., which will be fully explained later. All this will depend on the members, and we expect their full support and help to accomplish these things. This week the 5th Block and gallery go out, tickets will be issued on Saturday at noon. Rep. Delegate A 8482
