TOMORROW

He was going to be all thata mortal should be, Tomorrow; 
No one should be kinder or braver than he Tomorrow. 
A friend who was troubled and weary he knew, 
Who’d be glad of a lift, and who needed it, too, 
On him he would call and what he could do Tomorrow. 
Each morning he stacked up the letters he’d write Tomorrow; 
And thought of the folks he would fill with delight Tomorrow. 
It was too bad, indeed, he was busy today, 
And hadn’t a minute to stop on his way; 
More time I will have to give others he’d say, Tomorrow. 
The greatest of workers this man would have been Tomorrow; 
The world would have known him, had he ever seen Tomorrow. 
But the fact is he died and he faded from view, 
And all that he left here when living was through 
Was a mountain of things he intended to do Tomorrow.
