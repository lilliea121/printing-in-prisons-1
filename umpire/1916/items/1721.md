FINE SONG SERVICE BY E. S. P. CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA On Sunday afternoon last, the E. S. P. orchestra and choir gave a fine Song Service of sacred and classical music on the center, under the ab'e leadership of Professor A. F. Weigandt, which was much appreciated by the inmates. The program was well selected and elicited much praise from the visitors present by the manner of its rendition. A feature of its numbers was a bartone solo by B 7962, which was sung in good voice.

In the absence of Chaplain Joseph Welch, who is away on vacation, Warden R. J. McKenty, made a few well chosen remarks to the men, which was listened to with rapt tention by those assembled.
