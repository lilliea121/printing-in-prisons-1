BETHLEHM ——CALVARY By C. de B. L Bright Christmas !—or Easter-tide Which love we most? Holly and misletoe! Frost-king-and ghost. Traced in the icy drift Seen 'mid the shadows Under the woodland-tree This season hallows. Reign thou, O joy and mirth Banish all sadness. Naught must we offer thee But of our gladness. Wreathe we Thy cross to-day, Saviour, all-glorious; Who, from the gloom and grave Rises victorious. Brighter than Bethlehem's Star Is the beam falling Softly o'er Calvary's height This Easter morning. Joyful we now can say, In song and story, Life is Thy gift to-day Through Death to Glory. Printed By Request
