CHORAL SOCIETY GIVES SONG SERVICE AT E. S. P.

The members of the West Philadelphia Choral Society, under the leadership of Mrs. Sladen, gave an excellent song service at this institution on Sunday afternoon last.

The program consisted of sacred and classical songs of excellent selection, and the rendition proved above the average in blending of voices and in fine tonal quality, to which might be added a perceptible sense of enthusiastic devotion to the art of song by the singers.

“Another visit of the Choral Society will be mcst welccmre in the near future,” as announced by Chaplain Joseph Welch, who at the same time expressed thanks and appreciation to the participants for their services.
