HEAT AND HUMIDITY BREAK RECORD OF YEARS

Heat and humidity held the fort on Monday. People sweltered, and in looking up the the- mometer, found it to registered the hottest day inthe year.

Nearly all the cities in the country were effected by the heat wave and high humidlty, andNew York reports all records broken

Ber- muda high, they term it, leaving off the ball which to some stubborn souls still carries a draft of refreshing coolness with it.
