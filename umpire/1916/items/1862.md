U. S. MAIL RIFLED IN QUEST OF TRADE SECRETS

Lloyd George Exposes Policy of British Government Officials—Arouses Indignation in the U. S.—Vigorous American Protests to Follow

Considerable indignation is being manifested in this country, says a Washington corre- spondent, on account of the extension of the British mail censorship from its original pur- pose of destroying all trade to or from Germany, to the field of providing data for Great Britain’s fight for commercial supremacy, is seen here in admissions made by David Lloyd George, the War Secretary, before Parliament, just reccived in full in this country. Lloyd George said:

‘It is the practise to communicate to other departments concerned any information on matters of public interest which may be ob- tained through the censorship for such use to be made of it as the particular department may consider advisable. * * * The Government is perfectly in its right in using any information which comes to it in these conditions for any public and national purpose.’’

This statement, made recently in response to questions by members of the House of Commons, created a stir there as well as in this country. It apparently had been censored out of cable dispatches to the United States. When asked about the matter tonight, Secretary Lansing said it had been called to the attention of the State Depart- ment officially, but declined to make any comment at this time.

It is understood, however, that the Department will take a most serious view of Lloyd George’s interpretation of the British War Office’s power, and will protest more vigorously than ever against interference with neutral mails on the high seas.

Although the American Government has contended strongly against the wholesale detention and seizures of mail between neutral countries, as in violation of international law, so far there has been no formal charge that improper use was being made of information gleaned from opened neutral correspondence, but the open avowal of interference has caused a new and dangerous turn of affairs to continued friendly relations with England.
