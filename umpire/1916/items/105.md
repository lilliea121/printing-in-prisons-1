THE CAPE COD CANAL

Since the opening of the Cape Cod Canal,
nearly 3000 vessels have passed through this
waterway, including several Goverment ships.
Thus the submarines K-5 and K-6 made the
passage by way of the canal from Boston to
Newport, at the rate of eleven miles an hourâ€”a
Goverment test which must be looked upon as
most sucessful. The eight-mile trip through
the canal was made in 45 minutes, and by
using this passage the submarines saved sixty
miles of distance and avoided much rough
weather. The Kiel Canal was built by the
Germans at a cost approaching $100,000,000,
mainly for stragetic purpose; yet it is a fact
that the reduction of distance between the
Germans base in the Baltic and the North Sea,
by this canal islittle greater than the gain to the
American fleet, which would result from the
enlargement of the Cape Cod Canal to accommo-
date our battleships, between those two im-
portant stagelic centers, Newport and Boston.
