SOCIETY NOTE An unusual and pleasant social event occurred here last week on Block 2, where "our girls" are abiding temporarily in this "Rest Retreat." The occasion was the birthday of Matron Laura T. Boal. There was a very active "conspiracy" between all of the girls and Matrons E. S. Treher and M. C. Snyder to spring a very pleasant surprise on Guess Laura" when she came on duty at 4 P. Both these good and kindhearted matrons entered heartily into the "conspiracy" of their inmate charges to take Matron Boal unawares in a happy way. A beautiful table was spread in the reception room and decorated with flowers and fruits and a splendid banquet was ready "for Mrs. Boal when she arrived, and unsuspectingly escorted into the room. She was greeted with applause by all, and to say she was dumbfounded is to put it mildly. Tears of joy and thanks came to the good lady's eyes, but. she was too full for utterence. Refreshments were then served to all hands and amidst felicitations from everybody and wishes for many happy returns of the "party" dispersed.
