DAY'S RECORD OF 1,000 "SUNDAY" TRAIL HITTERS Over 1,000 "trail hitters" responded to Billy Sunday's efforts at Trenton, N. J, yesterday. Many were turned away from the afternoon meeting, and in the evening the tabernacle would not accommodate those seeking admission. There were 500 trail hitters in the afternoon, more than 300 at night and nearly as many at morning service. "Billy" was showing the result of his efforts in the afternoon when he started the night service, but the interest of his audience seemed to revive him, and he became as active and fiery as ever.
