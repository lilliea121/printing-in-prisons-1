It means electric light systems for prosperous farmers and electric washers and flatirons for the farmers’ wives. It means water systems and bathrooms and trips to California and the South next winter.

Iowa, with 303,000,000 bushels of corn last year, has in prospect 365,000,000 bushels this year, and the selling price now in 73 cents, as against 71 in 1915.
