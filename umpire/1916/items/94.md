H. & F. CLUB NOTES

An entire new program will replace that of
the past six weeks, beginning this Saturday,
and there will be surprises galore for the mem-
bers of the Club, as all of the acts are entirely
original, and-the various talent have been prac-
ticing very hard to make them a success

This week the 1st Block, 8th Block and 4th
Gallery go out, and we want to impress on you
again the importance of bringing your ticket,
as a number of our members have forgotten
them recently and it results in a lot of con-
{usion at the door, which otherwise would be
avoided. Any member losing his ticket here-
after will not be supplied with another, nor
will he be admitted to the hall unless the
ticket is produced.

After the performance the men should
leave the hall quietly and fall in line promptly
in columns of twos and return at once to their
respective Blocks and Galleries. Give your
line a military appearance. Do not string out
or bunch up in threes or fours, but return in a
soldiery manner, as it looks much better when

“crossing the centre.
