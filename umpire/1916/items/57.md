A COSMOPOLITAN COUNTRY

Constantinople and the neighboring regions
have been the great scene of quick change
cosmopolitanism in the past. “We naturally
think of natxonahty as being a matter of birth
and rice.”” says Sir Charles Eliot, “‘but in the
Levant it is regarded as a kind of privilege
or converience which may be acquired, lost or
changed at will. No one sees anything in-
congruous in one brother being an Englishman,
a second a Belgian and a third a Tuikish sub-
ject. At the outbreak of the Turco-Greek war,
Fdllenic subjects were placed under certain
dicabilities which affected their business to
a considerable extent. Oneof them came tome
one day and asked whether he could not be
made then and the e a British subject. He was
distiessed to find this was not possible; but a
day or two afterward I met him and he was
satisfied and smiling. He had become a Ser-
vian, and all was right again with him.
