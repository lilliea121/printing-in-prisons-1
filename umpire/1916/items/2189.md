DECORATIONS FOR THE CENTER

The members of the electrical school are putting the finishing touches to several illuminated pictures, which will form part of the Christmas decorations on the Center. A life-like plaster cast of Santa Claus is the surprise which ‘‘Curley” has had in store for us these last few weeks. Itisa work of art that the institution can be proud of. Besides this he has made several plaster wreaths illuminated by electric lights, which are to be placed at the head of the respective blocks.
