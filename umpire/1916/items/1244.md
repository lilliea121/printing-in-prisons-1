FORMER I. C. S. HEAD IS NOW A BANKRUPTIn a report from Scranton, Pa., it is said that visions of wealth which followed the wonderful success that attended the early years of the International Correspondence Schools, visions which led to the incorporation of other companies, some subsidary to the schools and others closely affiliated with it through interlocking directorates, were dispelled when Thomas J. Foster, founder and president of the International Correspondence Schools filed a voluntary petition in bankruptcy in the United States District Court. This is the sequence of the pyramiding of company upon company, each capitalized in the millions, and the exploiting of schemes under the name of Foster and the International Correspondence Schools. These companies, some 20 in number, were capitalized at about $129,000,000. Some have already collapsed and others are tottering, while the International Correspondence Schools were only saved from collapse by the bankers of the city coming to their rescue last summer with a loan of $500,000. The petition says that Foster has only $150. in cash and a bank deposit of $200 to his name.
