BY AIR AND WIRE

An accidental experiment in the vecliocity of
sound is recounted by a scientist attached to
one of Uncle Samâ€™s bureaus at Washington.

He had gone to his telephone, and just as he
put the receiver to his ear heard the click of
another telephone. Another receiver had been
removed and the line was open.

Then he heard through the telephone the
shriek of alocomotive whistle, and a few seconds
later the sound came through the open window
in the usual way. Looking up, he saw a loco-
motive half a mile away, passing a goverment
office. The telephone that was open was that
at the goverment office, and the sound of the
whistle had come through its transformation
into an electric current quicker than it had
traveled through the air.
