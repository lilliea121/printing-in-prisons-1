Son to Return After 28 Years Absence

After a search for her son, extending more than twenty-eight years, Mrs. Edward Banning, of Richmend, N. Y., will eat Christmas dinner with him. A letter received by her from Secretary of the Navy Daniels brought word that the much-sought-for son was in the navy, and that he would be granted a furlough.
