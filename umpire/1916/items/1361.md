MINERS STRIKE AVERTED A New York dispatch states that wage concessions which would increase the anthracite mine workers' payroll by approximately $9.000,000 in the next four years are offered in tentative agreement reached early yesterday by a joint sub-committee of operators and miners. The agreement, it was predicted by both sides, in all probability will be accepted by the tri-district board representing the miners at their meeting here today.
