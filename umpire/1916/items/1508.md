THE PASSING OF SING SINGGovernor Whitman of New York recently signed a bill passed at the last session of the legislature of that state, that will do away with Sing Sing, which has long been a pestilential disgrace to civilization. It may be said that it is not only old, Inadequate, and unsanitary, but the very plan upon which it is built—in every way similar to the Bastile cell block plan—is unquestionably a relic of the Dark Ages long past. It must be a matter of intense satisfaction to former Warden Osborne to realize that the medieval relic, Sing Sing, is to be replaced by a new institution built according to modern ideas of enlightenment as to the proper treatment of those who have broken the law stern mandate. It is a decided advance in the right direction that New York State's "black spot" and distributing station for vice and disease, is soon to be wiped out. Following the precedent of Pennsylvania, it is to be replaced by a farm and industrial prison in a commodious and healthful location.
