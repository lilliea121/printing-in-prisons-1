PRINCE BURIED IN $6.00 COFFIN

A Paris report claims that the circumstances of death and mysterious disappearance of the body of Prince Maximilien of Hesse, the 20-year-old nephew of the Kaiser, whose relatives invoked the aid of the Pope in an effort to obtain this information, are disclosed by a writer in the Petit Parisien.

The writer asserts that the Prince was shot during an engagement between a Saxon detach- ment, and an English patrol near Godewaersvelde, in northern France, early in the war. He was found by Trappist monks and taken to their monastery, where he died. The monks were ordered to evacuate the monastery, and Faiher Bernard, visiting the cloister on the following day, found the body of the Prince was missing.

The Petit Parisien writer says the body reposes in the cemetery in Hazebrouck, buried in a coffin costing 30 francs ($5.80), advanced by a poor man out of pity.
