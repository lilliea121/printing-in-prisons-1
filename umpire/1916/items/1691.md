PRISONERS TO BE EMPLOY- ED MAKING BRICKS

It is reported from good authority that Mont- gomery county roads are to be paved with brick, manufactured by prisoners at a county- owned brick plant.

Plans have been adopted by County Con- troller William D. Heebner, of Lansdale, and the board of county commissioners, of which George D. Sullivan, of Lower Merion township, is president, to begin operations at an early date.

According to persons in touch with the sit- uation, it is intended to buy a large tract of land in the central part of the county, where the soil is of the proper formation for the man- ufacture of bricks. It is figured the land can be acquired and a plant erected at an initial cost of $60,000.

Bricks could be produced at low cost, it is said, by the employment of prisoners, and the actual work of road construction would be given by contract.
