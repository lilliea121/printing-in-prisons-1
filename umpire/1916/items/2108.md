SACRED SONG SERVICE BY E. 5. P. CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA

Before an admiring audience of visitors at this institution on Sunday last, the E. S. P. choir and orchestra, under the efficient leadership of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, gave their regular monthly song service on the Center. The music and singing was exceptionally good, and encores were numerous. Chaplain Joseph Welch’s address to the inmates present was most interesting and logical, the subject being on “The Power of Prayer as a Help to Rehabilitate Man.’’
