JUDGE WEEPS AFTER PASSING DEATH SENTENCE

A most unusual scene took place at a Chicago Criminal Court the other day when Judge Joseph B. Sabbath, after passing a death sentence on Lloyd Bopp, twenty-three years old, covered his face and wept unreservedly for several minutes.

“I always prayed that if ever I became a judge I should never be called upon to go through an ordeal like this,” he said. Counsel for Bopp and others in court gave away to tears. Bopp murdered a motorcycle policeman four months ago.
