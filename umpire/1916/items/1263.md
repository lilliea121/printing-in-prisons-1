A VALUABLE SUBSTITUTE A few years ago platinum was regarded as indispensable in electrical apparatus, but at the present cost—about two and one-half times as much as gold—the more or less suitable substitutes found are being largely used in its place. This doubtless has some effect in preventing the price of the much wanted' metal from soaring still higher. Nickelchromium, metallic tungston, and metallic molybdenum are being made to serve in incandescent lamps, molybdenum seems to be coming into use for resistance wires for electric furnaces and heaters, and tungston is a material for the spark plug points of gas engines.
