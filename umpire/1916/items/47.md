WAGES FOR STEEL WORKERS
HIGHEST EVER PAID

The Steel Corporationâ€™s announcement of a
general wage advance, to take effect February
1, amounting tomore than 10 per cent. for
common labor, was followed by similar advan-
ces by independent companies, these for the
most part being made effective January 1.
Merchant blast furnaces took like action. so
that within a few days virtually the entire in-
dustry stepped up to the highest level of wages
it has ever paid.

The next great adjustment will be that in
coal mining, which has never been of more im-
portance to the iron trade than in this year of
unexpected strain on every link in the chain of
production and transportation.

Usually quiet in the first half of January,
the domestic steel trade has shown this month
that price advances have not reached their
limit and that export demand will be a factor
in establishing higher levels. At Pittsburgh
contracts amounting to 140,000 tons of barb
wire for war use are offered, but mills there
cannot make the deliveries asked. In bars for
shells, also, limitations on the buying by France
and England will be those.imposed. by mill

-conditions here.
