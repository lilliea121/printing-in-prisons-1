"I DIDN'T THINK" It is true that man seldom, if ever goes wrong when he thinks—thinks right.—It is also none the less true that he often does go wrong, which is proof that he does not think. If one seeks to do evil without reasoning out the consquences, he simply does'nt think; he takes a chance. All our experiences tells us which way we should go, but we often fail to call into play these stabilizers, of thought as we should. Time and again you may hear a man say, "I didn't think." Which recalls to mind the old axiom "to think well is to do well." With the vast amount of good literature to draw upon from many public libraries and other sources you would imagine that only the half—whit would use the expression, "I did'nt think." And yet it greatly surprises you at times, to hear that expression coming from a person who should feel belittled in saying, I didn't think. What a confession to make in public!
