TO THY FULL STATURE THOU SHALT GROW 

By thine own soul’s law learn to live, 
And if men thwart thee take no heed, 
And if men hate thee have no care; 
Sing thou thy song and do thy deed, 
Hope thou thy hope and pray thy prayer, 
And claim no crown they will not give, 
Nor bays they grudge thee for thy hair. 

Keep thou thy soul-worn steadfast oath, 
And to thy heart be true thy heart; 
What thy soul teaches learn to know, 
And play out thine appointed part, 
And thou shalt reap as thou shalt sow; 
Nor helped nor hindered in the growth, 
To thy full stature thou shalt grow.

Fix on the future’s goal thy face, 
And let thy feet be lured to stray 
Now hither, but be swift to run, 
And nowhere tarry by the way, 
Until at last the end is run, 
And thou mayst look back from thy place, 
And see thy long day’s journey done. 

— Beatty.
