Ye Olden Carol

"Lordlings, listen to our lay;
We have come from far away
To seek Christmas.
In this mansion, we are told,
He his yearly feast doth hold; 
Tis today.
May joy come from God above 
To all those who Christmas love’’

The earliest Christmas carol known was discovered in an old manuscript in the British Museum, and it is said to have originated in the thirteenth century.
