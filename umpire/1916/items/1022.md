CATHOLIC SERVICES Mass was celebrated at the Catholic services in the Chapel on Sunday morning last, the Rev. Michael A O'Kane officiating. The music and singing were especially good, the choir being greatly assisted by Miss Margarite Marie Marshall, who sang Dudley Buck's beautiful "Ave Maria," with telling effect. Father O'Kane, who is an able and impressive speaker, preached an eloquent sermon based upon the 15th chapter of St. Matthew. He impressed upon the minds of his congregation the necessity for regularity in attendance at the services. There was a large attendance of the inmates present.
