GETTING WISE"There is a place down the street where certain printers hang out when twilight has come and the day's work is over. And there's a reason!"In lifting type from gallery to form, a printer uses what is called a "makeup rule" It is a thin strip of steel, and you can buy â€˜em for about 10 cents a dozen."But the man that runs the place where the Ben Franklin boys go has been led to believe that this little bit of steel is the printer's badge. Without it the printer can't work, according to his conception. He has been led to believe that."So, when the printer asks him for the loan of a couple of dollars and is willing to leave the "make-up rule" as security, the genial host readily passes over the coin. He has a cigar-box full of the thin strips of steel at present and is beginning to think."
