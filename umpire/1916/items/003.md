MISS DAVIS REQUESTED TO
RESIGN AS COMMISSIONER

But Mayor Mitchell Offers Her Position
On The Parole Board

Dr. Katherine B. Davis, Commissioner of
Correction, the first woman to hold an import-

ant administrative position in N. Y. city, re-

signed to accept an appointment by Mayor
Mitchell to the new Municipal Parole Board.
Her salary will be about the same as she re-
ceived as commissjoner.

A commission appointed to investigate con-
ditions at Blackwell’s Island and other places
of detention under the administration of Miss
Davis, found a most deplorable state of affairs
at the island, and unanimously recommended
her immediate removal. Rumors were to the
effect that the “Black Hole of Calcutta’” was
no worse than Blackwell’s Island under Miss
Davis’ rule.

Mayor Mitchell appointed Miss Davis as
Commissioner of Correction when he took of-
fice January 1, 1914. A few days before she
had resigned as superintendent of the Bedford
Reformatory for Women, which position she
had held since 1901.MISS DAVIS REQUESTED TO
