LOOKING BEYOND There can be no doubt that happy prospects in life depend more upon the way people look than upon what they have to look at. If we think continuously of the discouraging things before us, that is what we will see. While if we keep our thoughts firmly fixed on clear purposes and hopes of things for our uplift and good, we will surely see many excellent possibilities open before us. Possibly things may now seem shut in by the darkness of what may appear to be closing about us; but let not that daunt the spirit,â€”there are rays. of light which will surely penetrate the seeming gloom, if we will persevere in our efforts to attain the best results. By always keeping serenely on our way and resolutely looking upon that which is beyond, we will surely see a bright luminous horizon, and in cime shall surely find that we are constantly facing a future of the highest possibilities.
