Brother of Dead Park Gangster Kills Himself

After boasting in a barroom at Thirteenth and Parrish streets Saturday afternoon that he was ‘‘out gunning for Frigar,” William Boland, of Calumet street near Ridge Avenue, Manayunk, turned away from the bar and killed himself with a single shot fired into his head with a revolver.

The suicide was a brother of Edward C. Boland, whom Ellis D. Frigar shot and killed on Neill Drive, Fairmount Park, while the young engineer’s sweetheart sat huddled in an automobile nearby. Frigar was released on $10,000 bail by Judge Audenried on habeas corpus proceedings.
