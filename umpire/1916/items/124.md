THE LATEST— "SPY ROCKETS"

It is said that England’s anxious lookout for
the activities of spies extends to the héévens,
where rocket-like meteors have several times
been rep rted by special constablesas ‘‘spy
rockets’’ ““One of these bodies formed the sub-
ject of a telegram' in which Mrs. Fiametta,
Wilson. the well-known meteor observer, asked
another meteor observe}, Miss Cook, whether
she had seen it. The telegram was held up by
the censor, but subsequently allowed to pass.”’
