BROTHERHOOD 

Men built on science, letters, art, 
Expanded realms, extended mart. 
Did they forget? Of straw and wood 
We build, forgetting brotherhood.

Lifeâ€™s issues now are wider grown, 
Nor man nor nation stands alone; 
And those who work for lasting good 
Include the thought of brotherhood.

Then build with science, letters, art: 
Shall we forget? The stronger part 
Is power that cannot be withstood; 
It is the strength of brotherhood.
