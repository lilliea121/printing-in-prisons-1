THE FLAG! By Arthur Macy Here comes The Flag—Hail it! Who dares to drag or trait it?! Give it hurrahs,—three for the stars,— three for the bars, Uncover your head to it; the soldiers who tread it, Shouted at the sight of it, the justice and might of it The unsullied white of it, the blue and red of it, And tyrany's dread of it! Here comes The Flag—Hail it! Valley and crag shall cheer it! Mothers shall bless it; children caress it! All shall maintain it, no one shall stain it. Cheers for the sailors that fought on the wave for it, Cheers for the soldiers who always were brave for it, Tears for the men who went down to the grave for it. Here comes The Flag. !
