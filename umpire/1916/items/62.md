SEPARATE PRISONS FROM POLITICS

One of our local papers that has championed
the cause of Ex-Warden Osborne from time t:.
time, makes the following editorial comment
in its columns. ‘“Whatever may be the merits
or defects of the kind of prison management
instituted at Sing Sing by Mr. Osborne, it is
plain that it could never have a fair show while
the Superintendent of State Prisons was so ob-
viously determined it should be a failure Mr.
Riley’s interference with Mr. Osborne in
matters of discipline was dangerous from the
first  Now that he has shown his purpose to
continue it with the new warden it was very
clearly the duty of Governor Whitman to
intervence. Having refused to resign, the
Superintendent now has to face the prospect
of removal on specific charges. Probably his
fight for retention will be of no henefit to him,
But if the hearings bring out the essentjal
facts in the situarion, reveal the baseness of
the political intrigues which have disgraced
the whole system of prison management in
New York, and awaken public opinion to the
necessity of earnest support for the work of
reform, they will be worth while.”’
