ALL TO BENEFIT UNDER PRISON LABOR LAW Prison Labor Commission to Put New System Into Operation Soon In an opinion construing the law providing for the new prison labor system of the State, applying to penitentiaries and the Huntingdon reformatory, Deputy Attorney General Joseph L. Kun says: It can not be assumed that it was intended to compensate those who were employed at some labor and not compensate those employed at other labor." The opinion was sent to Secretary John D. Dorris. of the Prison Labor Commission, which is preparing to put the system into operation, and says the last Legislature took advanced ground in providing for employment of prisoners and for "a most judicious system of compensation, calculated to promote and develop the willingness, industry and good conduct of such prisoners." The commission is informed that. prisoners engaged in manufacture and repair of shoes, clothing, machinery, fixtures, etc, are entitled to pay under the act, and that the same rule applies to a printing shop, which the commission desires to establish, and to those engaged in manufacturing or preparing material for the new Western Penitentiary, and for those engaged in prison farming. It is also held that prisoners engaged in cooking and cleaning are to be paid as well as those engaged in manufacturing. Mr. Kun says: "A prisoner engaged in Cooking is certainly employed in producing supplies for the institution as essential as another engaged in making shoes or clothing. If certain prisoners are. continuously engaged in cooking, dishwashing etc., It would be manifestly unfair and discouraging to them to have them do this work without compensation, while their fellow prisoners are receiving compensation for other work which perhaps is not so distasteful."
