PROBABLE MEXICAN COMMISSION

A Washington dispatch states that it is currently reported that the American members of the proposed commission to treat with the Mexicans, relative to disputed questions, may be composed of Chief Justice White, Major General Goethals and Frederick Lehmann. The name of Louis D. Brandeis, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, alco was mentioned.

It appears certain that Luis Cabrera, Mexican Minister of Finance, will head the Mexican commission.
