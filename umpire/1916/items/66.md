THE LOSS OF A NOTED WRITER

The literary world—and for that matter the
world at large—has lost a gifted and talented
writer in the passing away of Jeannette L. Gil-
der, at her home in New York City, the other
day. :

Miss Gilder was a woman of unusual abil-
ities, and possessed a charm of manner that
was most pleasing to those who came within
the circle of her acquaintance. .

At an early age Miss Gilder became a writer
in the Newark Register, and later the Newark,
N. J. reporter for the N. Y. Tribune. Her
next step was to become associated with her
late brother, R. W. Gilder, as an editorial
writer for Scribner’s Magazine, now the Cen-
tury. From there she changed to become the
literary, dramatic and musical department ed-
itor of the N. Y. Herald. At later inte: vals
she started the Critic and the Putnam's Maga-
zines, with her brother Joseph.

She was also the author of many interesting
books of fiction and poetry, and wrote several
well-known plays; among them, “Quits,"” “Sev-
en Oaks,” and “A Wonderful Woman," the
latter for Rose Eytinge.

The loss of this brilliant woman will leave
vacant a place that will be hard to fill.
