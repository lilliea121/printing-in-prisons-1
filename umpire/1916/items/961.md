FROM "SONG OF THE BELL" A thousand active hands combined For mutual aid, with zealous heart, In well apportioned labor find Their power increasing with their art. Master and workmen all agree, Under sweet Freedom's holy care, And each content in his degree, Warns every scorner to beware. Labor is the poor man's pride,— Success by toil alone is won. Kings glory in possessions wide,— We glory in our work well done. —Schiller
