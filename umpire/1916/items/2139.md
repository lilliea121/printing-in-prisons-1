DOES NOT REFORM

We believe that Our View Point takes the right stand in regard to long confinement of offenders against the law as a means of reformation. In fact, all reliable information points the other way. Whatever the reason, it is evident that ‘‘a great many people believe that men are reformed by long confinement in prisons. Nothing could be further from the truth. One of the saddest sights in life to the true humanitarian must be the spectacle of men discharged from our penal institutions, broken in. health and spirits, fearing renewed contact with the world, shrinking and slinking from the public gaze along the byways of life, keenly and often morbidly conscious of the stamp of ‘ex-convict’ with which they have been branded, and actually less fitted to earn an honest livelihood than when they were received. If this condition were generally known we believe a determined, concerted effort would be made to bring about reform in fact as well as on paper.’’
