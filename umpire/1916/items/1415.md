CIVIC EXPOSITION OPENS TO LARGE CROWDS ON MONDAY IT is so Big That it Cannot be Covered in a Day The extensive Today and To-morrow Civic Exposition opened its doors to the public at 11 o'clock Monday morning, on the receipt of a wireless telegram from President Wilson. Evidence of careful planning on an extensive scale was to be noticed on all sides, the principal idea being to make Philadelphia stand out as an ideal place for manufacturers, and as a city of homes for all people, rich or poor. In fact a place in which poverty, disease, or sickness are to be avoided. Most noticeable is the excellent order and cleanliness which marks the exhibition, speaking well for those in charge. One of the principal exhibits is that of the Eastern Penitentiary. The fine display work of the inmates of this institution augures well for the future of the prisoners, as we'll as for an expansion in prison reform methods.
