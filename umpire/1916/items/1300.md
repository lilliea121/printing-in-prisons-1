SUNDAY'S CATHOLIC SERVICES Palm Sunday was fittingly observed with Catholic services at the Chapel of this institution on Sunday last. The Rev. Father Michael A. O'Kane S.J. celebrating the Mass. The music and singing was most appropriate for the occasion, the violin solo being especially good. Increasing interest in the service was manifested by the large number of inmates present, the Chapel being taxed to its full capacity. The ability and genial personality of Father O'Kane has proven a strong factor in the growth and popularity of the Catholic services here.
