FINDING OF NEW DIAMOND FIELDS REPORTED

It is reported from Washington that the dis- covery of new diamond fields in the Trans- vaal has been reported to the Department of Commerce by Edwin N. Gunsaulus, American consul at Johnnesburg, Transvaal, Union of South Africa. The consular report says it is “about six miles distance from the famous Premier diamond mines and 18 miles from Pretoria,” and adds that in the course of three weeks a few diggings have sold for $15,000 worth of diamonds in two washings, and as far as known only one washing thus far has produced a blank.

The Government mining engineer has not yet visited the ground. The undertaking as it stands today, is described of splendid promise for those interested in the matter.
