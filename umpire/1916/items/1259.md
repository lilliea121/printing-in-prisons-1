NEVER! No one is beat till he quits, No one is through till he stops; No matter how hard failure hits, No matter how often he drops, A fellow's not down till he lies In the dirt and refuses to rise. Fate n.ay slam him and bang him around, And batter his frame till he's sore; But she never can say that he's downed While he bobs up serenely for more. A fellow's not dead till he dies, Nor beat till no longer he tries. â€”Selected
