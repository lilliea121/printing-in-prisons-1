An important advance in the development of radio telegraphy as a means of communication by the Navy Department was achieved the other day, at the Federal radio station at Arlington, Va. A message to the monitor Cheyenne at Long Beach, Cal., was despatched through the sending apparatus of the naval wireless plant at Point Loma. The sending apparatus at Point Loma was handled exclusively by the Arlington operator, more than 80(0 miles away with highly satisfactory results.
