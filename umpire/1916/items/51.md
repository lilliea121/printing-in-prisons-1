THE WONDERS OF STONEHENGE

Everyone has heard of Stonehenge—a pre-
historic mounment which is almost as much of a
puzzle as the Sphinx in- Egypt, or the mounds
erected by the mound-builders in America
Stonehenge is about ten miles north of S lis-
bury, in Wiltshire, England. The name comes
from two Saxon words meaning
stones.’’

The earlier Celtic ‘name was Cor Gawr or
giants' temple. There are in many localitie:
in the northwest of Europe prehistoric re-
mains in the form of huge stone monuments cr
“tumull’’ or “barrows”fthat 15, bowl-shapcd
mounds or hills of earth. In the neighborhocd
of. Stonehenoe there are hundreds of these
mounds. Coms and many vaulable relics found
in -them seem to date them back about three
centuries before Christ.

It must have taken an immense amount of
work to make them, and there must have been
some profound and serious purpose behind them_
