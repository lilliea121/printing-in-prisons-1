THE WORLD’S UPS AND DOWNS

The world is full of hypocrites,
An honest man we say misfits. 
The ups and downs of life is rude,
Is nothing but get money and food.

Anything that’s good and true 
Is criticised by me and you. 
The man who is of little note 
Still counts when it is time to vote.

If a man is rich he is a thief,
As he got his gold creating grief. 
A poor man who can rarely live
Is always called upon to give.

If there were no rich, the poor would die, 
If there were no poor, the rich would cry. 
Some of us just toil for gain, 
While others sit down and use their brain.

The more we hurry the less we get. 
If we go slow we’re sure to regret. 
So what’s the use to worry at all 
Or get our names in the world-famed hall?

Just do a favor every now and then 
And live by the help you give other men. 
For after all it’s the soul we make 
Before we are ready for God to take.
