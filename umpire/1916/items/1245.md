TEMPERANCE UNION TO MAKE CITY-WIDE FIGHT ON "BOOZE""It is a well known fact that a saloonkeeper who sells â€˜booze' will not employ a drunkard as a bartender." This and numerous other concise statements, set forth in red letters, will mark this city from end to end in a Philadelphia Poster Campaign to start May 1st. The movement was announced yesterday at the headquarters of the National Temperance Union, 730 Widener Building.More than 1000 posters of various sizes, color and text will be sent to Kensington. One prominent real estate man has offered to the union the use of the windows of all of the vacant stores and homes he has in his charge for display purposes. Other conspicuous points will be placarded until the entire city is apprised of the evil and far-reaching influences of liquor. They do not dignify alcoholic beverages by calling them liquors, intoxicants or whiskey; with them is a "booze." The campaign is being planned to reach its greatest effectiveness before the spring primaries.
