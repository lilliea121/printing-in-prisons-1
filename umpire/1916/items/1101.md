PENNSYLVANIA STATE COLLEGE PROFESSOR LECTURES AT THE Prof. Thos. I. Mairs, of the Pennsylvania State College, gave a very interesting lecture at the Industrial Building of this institution, on Friday afternoon of last week. The discourse covered general agricultural subjects and was most interesting and instructive. Prof. Mairs said that it was intended to have a lecture at this institution on some agricultural subject, each Friday in the further. This will be good news for the inmates interested in that course of study, and will prove a help in perfecting their lessons. There were about one hundred and twenty-five inmates students present, and all seemed highly pleased with the lecture.
