PUBLIC SENTIMENT FORCES
CONSPIRATORS TO
GIVE NAMES

Grand Jury Withdraws Former Indict-
ment Against Osborne But Will
Present A New One

Public sentiment in N. Y. State has been so
aroused over the frame-up of former Warden
Osborne, that those at the back of the move-
ment are being forced to show their hand.
This was not anticipated by the “gang’ and they
are now somewhat ‘‘at sea’’ 'as to the best
move to make in order tuv cover up the nefari-
ous schemes that actuated their malice and
spirit of revenge in seeking the former wardens
removal. ‘That the Westchester County Grand
Jury has been a pliant tool in the hands of the
is but too evident. To lessen the
odium of their situation they have made a
change of front and will divulge the source of
the su called evidence against Mr. Osborne.
An indication of thisis to be had in the fact
that they have decided to drop the former in-
dictments and take up a new one. The Jury
will reconvene to day and it is expected that
they will vote on an indictment to supersede
the one found recently.

It now seems doubtful if the jurors will hear
any more testimony. It issaid the new endict-
ment, which will contain six counts under the
specific heading of mismanagement, will be
more direct in the accusation than the original
and that certain inmates in the prison who were
designated as “‘unknown’’ will be named.

The conspirators have learned that inqusi-
tional methods are nolonger to be tolerated in
this age and time, and the sooner they ‘‘take
to the bush’ to hide their dirty intrigue per-
haps the better it will be for their future welfare.
