INVISIBLE SHIPS

The enormous range and accuracy of modern
naval guns makes it highly important for small
war craft, which depends upon speed rather
than armor plate to weather the attacks of the
enemy, to render themselves as invisible as
possible. Herertofore, a dark gray paint has
been considered the best color to supply to a
war vessel. Now experiments are being made
with varieties of colors. Ideas are being bor-
rowed from the mimicry of nature. We find
certain animals cloaked with spotted fur and
others with stripes, depending upon the nature
of their environment, and these colorings make
them very difficult to discover in their natural
habitat. In exactly the same way our naval
authorities are trying to render torpedo boats
invisible by painting wavy stripes on them.
