CHILDRN'S CHRISTMAS FUND

In the following issue we will print the
numbers of the inmates of this institution who
in kindl_y spirit gave their offering to help make
a Christmas for the kiddies that might other-
wise have been neglected, owing the  plight
of their fathers incarceration here, and their
inability to provide the much desired cheer for
the innocent and loved ones. The ‘‘Big Bro-
ther’” movement was a complete success in so
far as that all were provided for whose 1eeds
were made known to those in charge of the
matter, and the many expressions of thanks to
be heard from various persons would seem tn be
indicative of sincere gratitude on their part for
the remembrance from the warm hearted men
“Cherry Hill." To every one who contri-
buted toward making this Children's Fund a
success, we extend the happiest felicitations for

the New Year, and without doubt they will be

many times rewarded for their generosity in
ways that should prove most gratifying to them.,

There were two hundred and thirty three
children provided for, which is. nearly twice the
number that received presents the year pre-
vious, Twenty two infants at the “Sheltering
Arms’ Mission, also received a generous‘package
from the ‘““Big Brothers’’ of ‘“Cherry Hill.”’
‘‘And now abideth faith, hope and charity,
these three; but the greatest of these is Char-
ity.”” And charity means Love,
