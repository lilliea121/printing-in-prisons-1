SINGING ON THE WAY By Eben E. Rexford Oh, comrade onward farring, Let's sing in cheerful strain A song to brighten labor And soothe the hurt of pain. A song so full of gladness, So blithe with hope and cheer, That weary wayside pilgrims Will gain new strength to hear. Life holds for most, my comrades, More happiness than pain. Nature gives a day of sunshine For every day of rain. So trusting in the wisdom Of this eternal plan, Let's face the rain or sunshine And do the best we can. Oh, Let's sing my comrades, Of blessing by the way. Each cloud's a silver lining; There's blue beyond the grey! So as we sing about it The shadows break apart, And all the world's In sunshine Because we're light of heart!
