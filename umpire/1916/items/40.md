 HE GOT THE RAISE

  The diminutivé office boy had worked hard
  on a salary cof two dollars a week. He wasa
  subdued little chap, faithful and quiet. Fin-
  ally, just before the New Year, he plucked up
courage enough to ask for an increase

“ How much more would you like?’” inquired
his employer.

«Well,” answered the lad, “Idon’t think
fifty cents more a week would be too much.”’

““ou are rather a small boy to be earning
two do'lars and a half a week."”

““[ know I am small,”” he replied, ‘““but, to
tell the truth, since I've worked here [’'ve been
s0 busy I haven’t had time to grow.”’

He got the raise.
