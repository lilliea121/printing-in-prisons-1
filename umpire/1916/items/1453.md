THE BRAVEST BATTLESAdelbert ClarkWe fight the bravest battles whereNo smoke from cannons roll;We lift the brightest standards whenWe drive fear from the soul.These silent battles of our livesAre waged twixt right and wrong,And he who heeds, the warning cryIs marshalled on by song.And though the scars are furrowed That hint of other days,The singing of the soul shall be Of everlasting praise‘T will count for naught the long, hard—The suff'ring and the pain,The grim scarred battle-flag of daysThat bore the crimson stain.We fight the bravest battles whereNo musketry is heard,Nor battlefield or winding waysWith battlefield or winding waysWith blinding smoke is blurred;But where the heart is in the leadTo conquer all that's wrong,And kindly deeds move every soul to light the weak with song.
