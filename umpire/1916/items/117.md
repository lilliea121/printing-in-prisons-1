UPKEEP OF ARMY AND
NAVY BY NEW PLAN

Congressman Davis Would “Make Money
: Fight For Its Country”

Representative ‘“Cyclone Davis,”” member
at large from the State of Texas, introduced
a bill in the House to ‘‘make money fight for
its country the same as men.””” Mr. Davis is
an opponent of the preparedness program.
The Davis plan is that each corporation in the
United States shall be counted as an individual
and be forced to pay the cost of the upkeep of
one or more soldiers or sailors. For cach $50,
000 of capital and surplus above $250,000 the
corporation shall support one =sailor or soldier.
In time of war a corporation must support one
soldier or sailor for each $25,000 above a capital
and surplus of $75,000.

Mr. Davis has also devised a graduated
scale for the payment of upkeep sums bv per-
sons and families with large incomes. Inheri-
tances, dowries and foreign investments in
America must, in effect, adopt a soldier or
sailor in the United States forces provided the
inheritances, dowries or incomes from foreign
investments here exceed $50,000.

The Texan proposes that those who violate
the law shall be treated as deserters and shot
in wartime. 1
