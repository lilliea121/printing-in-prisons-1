KING'S VISIT RESTORES SPEECH A story is told of how the king of Italy has been responsible for one of the most extraordinary occurrences of the war. His majesty has been constant in his visits to his wounded soldiers, and one day he arrived quite unexpectedly at a certain field hospital. Among the patients there was a young lieutenant who had been stricken quite dumb by the bursting of an Austrian shell. The poor fellow was lying in bed feeling very miserable, when, all of a sudden, he glanced up and found the king standing by his side. In a moment he started up in amazement at the unexpected honor, and shouted at the top of his voice: "His majesty the king!" and burst into a flood of tears. The emotional shock, coming as it did, so unexpectedly, had completely restored his power of speech, and even the king himself was overcome by emotion at this extraordinary "miracle."
