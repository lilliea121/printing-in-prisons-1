BOIL IT DOWN If you've got a thought that's happy Boil it down; Make it short and crisp and snappy— Boil it down. When your brain its coin has minted, Turn the page your pen has printed, If you want your effort printed Boil it down. Take out every surplus letter— Boil it down; Fewer syllables the better— Boil it down. Make your meaning plain—express it, So we'll know, not merely guess it— Then, my friend, ere you address it, Boil it down. Cut out the extra trimmings— Boil it down; Skim it well, then skim the trimmings, Boil it down. When you're sure 'twould be a sin To cut another letter out, Send it on—and we'll begin to Boil it down. —L. A. W. Bulletin
