SUBSTITUTE FOR PLATINUM DISCOVERED BY AMERICAN One of the trade journals reports that substitutes for platinum which will materially relieve the scarcity of that metal in this country because of the war have been discovered by American chemists, F. A. Fahrenwald, of Cleveland, announced Friday in an address before the American Institute of Mining Engineers. He asserted that gold and silver alloys of palladium have been found to be excellent substitutes for platinum in its softer forms. It is expected, Mr. Fahrenwald said, that experiments with these alloys will revolutionize the work of the dental profession in platinum. Saturday the engineers held their annual dinner and on Monday they were the guests of the Naval Consulting Board in an inspection of New York harbor defenses on the Dolphin, flagship of the Secretary of the Navy. Only American citizens were allowed to disembark at Sandy Hook.
