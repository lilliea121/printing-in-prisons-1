REPLY TO “WHERE IS MY WANDERING  BOY TONIGHT"

By Dr. Thomas Edwin Eldridge.

Wipe your weeping eyes Mother
For with joy I have to tell
That your Wandering Boy is saved tonight
And now with the Saviour dwells..

Chorus

Oh your boy is saved tonight
Oh your boy is saved tonight

He is freed from sin, He now lowv. es‘you agaxn
Oh your boy is saved tonight.

At last I've given myself to Christ.
Weary.and sick of sin

I've opened wide my wretched heart
And let the Saviour in.

So long I prayed, but prayed in doubt
That my Lora might forgive my sins

That Christ would save me as | was.
And cleanse my guilty stains.

My prayer was heard,
So now ['ll live for Him

Who died that you and all mankind
May ever dwell in Heaven.

Now you who have heard this joyful news
Of one once lost in sin

Accept His Grace, believe His VVor(l
And live as unto Him.
