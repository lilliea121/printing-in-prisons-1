RECOMMENDS ABOLITION OF JAILS IN THIS STATE It was decided that the abolition of county jails, except as places of detention, and the establishment of six sectional farms in different parts of the State be recommended, in a report of, the committee on revision and amendment of; penal laws. of the State Bar association, which was adopted at a meeting of the executive committee, of, that organization recently. The conditions, found to be existent at many of the county jails were considered insanitary, and otherwise objectionable. The committee also selected Bedford Springs as the place where. the next annual convention will be held. Howard W. Page, of Philadelphia presided.
