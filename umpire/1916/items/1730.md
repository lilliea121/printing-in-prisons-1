A NEW PUBLICATION

â€˜We have at hand the announcement number of the Messenger of the Unfortunate, a publication somewhat similar in character to our esteemed contemporary, The Survey, which bears every evidence of filling a long felt need. As is well known to the reading public, it is a most difficult matter to lay barec the actual condi- tions existing today in many of the jails, houses of correction, asylums and penitentiaries thru-out the country, and the need of a sincere organ to expose disgraceful and barbarous conditions is very evident.

If Editor Speckert is able to accomplish the much desired reforms through the medium of the Messenger of the Unfortunate, we do not hesitate to say that the friends and relatives of suffering humanity will owe him a debt of gratitude that may not easily be expressed in words.

We gladly extend our best wishes for the unreserved success of the Messenger.
