A REMINDER OF STEVENSONReaders of Robert Louis Stevenson's magnificent modern romance. "The Wreckers," will be interested to learn that remote Midway Island the scene of the tragic and superbly depicted combat between the men of the "Currency Lass" and those of the brig "Flying Scud," of Hullâ€”has at last invaded the magazines by way of the "Popular Science" monthly. That publication describes the transpacific cables station there and tells how the rugged coral of the little isle is gradually being covered with good soil transported every three months by the schooner which brings provisions from Hawaii. It is now possible for the cables operators to keep a cow pasture. Midway, by the way, is a possession of the United States.
