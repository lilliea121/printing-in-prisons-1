GREAT CANOPUS This giant of the stellar system is, according to a recent calculation of W. F. A. Ellison, 49,000 times as bright as the sun. It is 134 times as large as the sun in diameter, 18,000 times in surface a1 d 2,420,000 times in volume. Its distance from us, according to the same estimate, is 489 light years. Suppose, says Mr. Ellison, that instead of being at this enormous distance it were placed in the center of the solar system, in lieu of the sun. It would then occupy eigthy-five houndredths of the space lying within the orbit of Venus, and, as seen from the earth, would subtend an angle of about 70 degrees of arc.
