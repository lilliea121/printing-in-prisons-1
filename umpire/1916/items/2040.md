College Course for Police

According to a Cambridge, Mass., report Harvard University is to extend its instruction to police officers. A course in the duties of officers will be instituted within a month. It will be the first of the kind in the world.

Raymond B Fosdick, of New York, an expert in some branches of police methods, has been invited to become the first instructor. His teaching, which will be in day and night classes to allow members of all police shifts to participate, will deal largely with the matter of organization, the keeping of station house records, identification systems and to some extent with psychology as it relates to the interrogation of persons arrested.
