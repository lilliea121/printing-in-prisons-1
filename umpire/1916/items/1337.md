SONG OF THE UNDISMAYEDBy Berton BarleyLife, you have harried and hurt and scourged meMocked me cruelly through the years. Under a burden of woe submerged me Sought to fright me with pain and tears.Fortune and glory me—and took awayYet, for all of the years you've tried me,Dauntless I sing to the world today.For out of the wreck of a vanished passionOut of the failure, the doubt, the pain, Out of the sorrow and death I'll fashionMany a song in a fearless strain,And the songs I make shall have no savorOf useless longing or vain regret,Aud I shall carol to make men braverFor every trial that must be me?Failure, defeat, despair—I know themBut still I challenge then, unafraid,And men shall overthrow themPerchance before of a song I've made;Life, through my peace and my joy be takenThrough all my visions and dreams go by,I'll lift my voice in a tone unshaken And keep on singing until I die!
