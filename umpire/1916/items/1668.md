SAVE THE BOYS!

In an address which was delivered before tke National Congress of Mothers and Parent-Tea- chers Association at Detroit, Mich., Mrs. Fred- erick Schoff, of this city, declared that 90 per cent of truancy occurs with boys, and that 90 per cent of the juvenile court children are boys.

The entrance of so many boys into lives of crime, she asserted is far worse than infant mortality, and is in a large degree due to par- ential neglect. Continuing, Mrs. Schoff made it plain that ‘‘each boy should be treated as an individual, needing loving care and proper guidance,’’ and suggested that boys can be helped to become good, law-abiding men by a ‘‘definite systematic co-operation of home, school and church, business men and the court, if con- ducted on the basis of true insight into boy na- tures and tendencies.’’

The address was well received by the assembly and it is expected to pave the way for plans to keep a closer watch over the growing youth, and to see to it, that parents are held to stricter account for the proper care of their children.
