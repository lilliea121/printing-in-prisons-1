Look For The Good

“Keep the attitude divinely optimistic all
the time. Endeavor to read and see the good
quality in every man you meet or deal with. °

Believe that God is no respector of persons.
Believe that he loves you as much asany other
man that ever lived. Be not persuaded by any
appearance that you are the “under dog.” In
the mind of God there is no inferiority. The
Divine Idea is perfect.” '
