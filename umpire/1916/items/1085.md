SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVILGrace McCowan CookHow shall I see no evil?As the sun on the filthy pool divining Naught but the glow of its own clean shiningSo shall you see no evil?How shall I hear no evil?As the lark in the blue, toward heaven winingHears only the sound of its clear singing,So shall you hear no evil.How shall I speak no evil?"As thyself, thy neighbour" such loving kindness,Will bring the holy deafness and blindness—And dumbness—to speak no evil.
