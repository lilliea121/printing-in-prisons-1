LARGEST AUTO SHOW
ON RECORD

Grand Central Palace Thronged With A
Crowd of 51,000 In One Day

The automobile show just closed at N. Y.
city was the largest ever held at the Grand
Cenliral Palace—the biggest show in attend-
ance, the biggest in the number and character
of exhibits. The show has been a record-
breaker in every way. The attendance was
51,000, in one day, that being a record for
attendance up to that time. The managers of
the show express great satisfaction at the re-
sults of this year’s show.

The buying capacity of the crowds has been
even more impressive, in comparison with the

visitors of former years, than the numbers who
have veiwed the outomobiles on display. Rep-
resentatives of the manufacturers of complete
cars and accessories said that the volume of
business done by them had exceeded all ex-
pectations and were optimistic.
