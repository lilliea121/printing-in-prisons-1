H. & F. CLUB NOTES By A 8482, B 7927 There appears to be a misunderstanding regarding the rules of our entertainments, and as quite a few of our members have been coming out on Saturdays. which they are not entitled to, we would like to enlighten them on this point. Members must attend the entertainment with their block or gallery. If, on the particular Saturday, your block is to go out, and for some reason, such as work or illness you are unable to attend the entertainment with them, let me know, we will! give you a ticket the following week. When a member is to be discharged sometime during the week, we will give him a ticket on the Saturday previous to his release. A new member joining the club will be given a ticket for the Saturday following the acceptance of his application for membership into the club. Each entertainment runs for a period of six weeks, and every member is entitled to. see it once and no more. This week the 3, 9 and 12 Blocks go out. Tickets will be given out on Saturday at noon.
