A FEW WORDS TO CORRESPONDENTS Utilizing the power of observation is one of the most valuable assests in life, and through the lack of it many are prone to failure. It would not seem difficult to note that the Umpire is a small paper of limited space. Such being the case it is quite out of the question to print lengthy articles. Bear in mind that much of the world's finest literature has been passed to us in comparatively small articles of from one hundred to five or six hundred words.No one wants to wade through a long winded article of small merit simply for the pleasure of reading. If you have anything worth while to say, "boil it down," and express your thoughts in the fewest possible words, so that he who reads may "sit up and take notice" of what you have to say.
