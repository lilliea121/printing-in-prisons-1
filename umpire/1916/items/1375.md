BLAU GAS Blau gas, named after its German inventor, liquefies under pressure, shrinking to one four-hundredth of its normal volume at atmospheric pressure. It is therefore transportable in steel bottles as easily as oil or alcohol, and is usable in places where gas could not otherwise be readily supplied. For car heating or lighting, in welding and metal-cutting tools, for highspeed soldiering, it is said to be invaluable. It contains most of the same elements, although in different proportions, as ordinary illuminating gas, and is similarly made, but is without carbon monoxid and therefore is nonpoisonous. Also its chemical inertia is so great as to make it practically nonexplosive. Its range of explosion is one-twelfth that of acetylene and one-third that of ordinary coal gas, It is cheaper to produce than acetylene.
