It is announced in one of the government bulletins that the Department of Agriculture has undertaken the third census of birds in the United States. Voluntary enumerators through out the country has been requested to lend their services in order to facilitate the work of the department in this effort. The plan is to have the volunteers count the birds on 40-acre tracts in the immediate neighborhood of the homes.
