U.S. TROOPS IN CLOSE PURSUIT OF VILLA Aeroplanes Being Used By General Pershing For Communications From San Antonio, Tex., the latest information is to the effect that Gen'l Pershing in a delayed report to General Funston confirmed previous information that American troops were moving southward from Cusihuirachic on the trail through Satevo and that all the information available at his headquarters indicated that Villa, was traveling in the direction of Parral. General Pershing reported on the exact positions of the advanced columns and what those units are, but this information was withheld. One of his flying scouts had located Colonel Brown's column of Cusihuirachic on April 12th General Pershing reported It was believed here that by this time Colonel Brown, after receipt of supplies at Cushiuirachic, had again joined in the chase. His was the first column to arrive so far south, but the exhaustion of his supplies had forced him to halt there. Aeroplanes are being used by General Pershing for communication with Consul Letcher at Chihuahua, according to official reports to General Funston yesterday. Two aeroplanes from the front reached Chihuahua Tuesday with dispatches, which it is expected will be sent over the commercial wires to El Haso.
