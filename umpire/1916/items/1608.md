A report from Seaside Heights N. J,. states that for the first time in the memory of the oldest coast residents, whales were seen off shore yesterday. They were first sighted by Captain Arthur R. Meyers, of the Berkeley Fishing Company, and by the crews of two of the fishing boats attached to the fishing company's grounds.
