THE CUP OF LIFE

By Alice Dooley

Oh, what is life worth if 'tis not for another?
When we dip in the deep well of life for a draft
If the cup is not held to the lips of a brother
"T'will change into bitterness while it is quaffed.

Drink deep, then; begrudge not your soul its
full measure

Of happiness; sing like a bird if you’re gay.

But whetheryou’re happy 6rsorl‘0w'lel, treasure

The chance to give happiness, just for a day.
