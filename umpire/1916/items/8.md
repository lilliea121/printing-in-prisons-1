RECOMMENDS ABOLITION OF
JAILS IN THIS STATE

It .was decided that the abolition of county
jails, except as places of detention, and the es-
tablishment of six sectional farms in different
parts of the State be recommended, in a report
of , the committee on revision and amendment
of.:. penal laws of the State Bar association,
which was adopted at a meeting of the execu-
tive committee, of , that organization recently.

"~ The conditions  found to be existent at many

of the county jails were considered insanitary
and otherwise objectionable. The committee
also selected  Bedford Springs as the place
where. the next annual convention will be held.
Howard W. Page, of Philadelphia presided.'
