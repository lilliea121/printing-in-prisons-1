A SINGING HEART
By Roscoe G. Stott

Oh, for a singing heart within my breast
That in the stifled. sordid grind of all
Life’s common place, where petty cares hold
thrall,
My soul may throb with melody serene and
blest;
Or, bursting into some full chant of Hope,
Its notes may break the stillness of the night
For some, who, weeping in their sorry plight,
With all their bitter griefs but poorly cope.

Be mine a singing heart that thrills and cheers;
That wakes a counter melody; that lifts
To skyward from the murky passion-drifts;
That lights the eye self-blinded by its tears.
Be mine a singing heart, whose anthem floats
With God’s pure sunshine woven through its
notes.A SINGING HEART

Oh, for a singing heart within my breast
That in the stifled. sordid grind of all
Life’s common place, where petty cares hold

My soul may throb with melody serene and

Or, bursting into some full chant of Hope,
Its notes may break the stillness of the night
For some, who, weeping in their sorry plight,
With all their bitter griefs but poorly cope.

Be mine a singing heart that thrills and cheers;
That wakes a counter melody; that lifts
To skyward from the murky passion-drifts;
That lights the eye self-blinded by its tears.
Be mine a singing heart, whose anthem floats
With God’s pure sunshine woven through its
notes.
