Is it possible? Do our eyes deceive us or are we dreaming? The latest news reports announce that two of London’s leading journals have admitted the great blunder at Gallipoli, and the mishandling of the Rumanian intervention, with a possibility of a future break-down of the ‘‘great drive.”

To quote that ‘‘the naval blockade can never of itself reduce Germany and that Russia can never act with anything like her maximum power until the stupendous task of reopening the Dardanelles and the Black Sea is accomplished’’—a near impossibility—a ray of real sanity has at last penetrated the English mind.

Then to realize that "the Germans grasped the situstion when the Allies blundered, and struck first in a way that does equal credit to their intelligence and energy’’ is to see the possibility of peace begin to take form.
