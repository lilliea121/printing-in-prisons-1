A STRANGE WIRELESS STATION On Swan Island, in the Caribbean Sea, is situated what is probably the most isolated wireless station in the world. The station crew is made up of three operators, two engineers, a cook, a machinist and three laborers. No women are permitted to land on the island. Men who express a willingness to go to Swan Island, are obliged to sign a contract whereby they agree to remain at least eighteen months, or waive their right to free return transportation. Those remaining the full period of service are returned to their homes by way of one of the Central America ports and are granted six weeks' vacation with full pay. Strangely enough, there is no difficulty in obtaining men to man the station. Applicants, indeed, exceed the number of vacancies. Board and lodging, of course, are supplied, a boat bearing all provisions necessary, fresh meat; and the mail as well, we go onâ€” including arriving Some men have remained on the island as long as two years and a half and, subsequently, have been glad to return to the station.
