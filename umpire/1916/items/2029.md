A PERFECT MAN

“There is a man who never drinks 
Nor smokes, nor chews, nor swears; 
Who never gambles, never flirts, 
And shuns all sinful snares— 
He’s paralyzed! 

“There is a man who never does 
A thing that is not right; 
His wife can tell just where he is 
At morning, noon and night— 
He’s dead!”
