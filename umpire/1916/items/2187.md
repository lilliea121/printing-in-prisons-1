Christmas, 1916

Be strong in faith; unfearing, wait;
And if, unchecked from human woe, 
Loud roar the raging gale of Hate,
Let love’s pure lamp the clearer glow;

Keepbright that lamp, keep safe that shrine, 
Hold that one altar void of stain—
The gale will fall, the lamp will shine, 
For hate must die and love shall reign.
