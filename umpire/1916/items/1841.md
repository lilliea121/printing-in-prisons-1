VILLA LEADS LARGE FORCE RAILROAD STRIKE AVERTED BALL GAMES OF THE WEEK FOR RAID ON BORDER

Defeats Carranzaâ€™s Men and Seizes Railway Train to Bring Troops North

Latest reports from El Paso, Tex., claim that Villa is making his way toward the American lines in Mexico and is heading toward the American border as a last desperate effort to rally the thousands of Villistas on the American side of the boundary with another spectacular raid across the border like that at Columbus.

This was the official report received from General Jacinth Trevino at Chihuahua City by General Gonzales at Juarez in a request for all available men who can be sent out to intercept Villa and his men and prevent them from reaching Namiquipa and El Valle, where the American troops are stationed. Three hundred Juarez troops were rushed south.

Villa, with a force recruited as a result of his victories near Satevo, to about one thousand men, attacked General Elizondo in the vicinity of Santa Ysabel and forced him to fall back toward Chiahuaha City, according to late private dispatches received here. After the engagement Villa seized a freight train on the Mexico Northwestern, which he set his men to converting into a troop train.

A Mexican was taken from a trainat Ysifta and is being held in the Fort Bliss guardhouse on suspicion of being Hipolito Villa.

From Chihuahua City it is reported that prior to taking Satevo, Villa announced his intention of leading his command to the Texas border, there to be joined by revolutionists who have been living in the United States and with whom he has been in communication, according to several members of his command captured at San Fermin, Chiahuahua, Colonel Isidore Cardona reported Monday.
