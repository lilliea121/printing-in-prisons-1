AS VOICED BY OTHERS

Under another title the Boston Globe makes the followmg comment in regard to prison literature:

â€œSuch work of heart and brain is a testi- mony to the vitality of:some few men. They are the exceptions; they are not the rule. A great novel, the great American novel for which the critics sigh, may come out of a six-by-eight cell. It may be half written now, but it is not likely. The fact that some individuals have used their time and brains as a meens to win fame, must not blind us to the WORTH of the modern movement to make prisons and prison experiences less terrible. WHEN PRISONS REALLY MAKE MEN BETTER, LITERATURE AS WELL AS LIFE WILL BE EN- RICHED.
