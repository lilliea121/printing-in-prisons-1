GREAT CANOPUS

This giant of the stellar system is, according
to a recent calculation of W. F. A. Ellison,

- 40,000 times as bright as the sun. It is 134

times as large as the sun in diameter, 18,000
times in surface ar d 2,420,C00 times in volume.
[ts distance from us, according to the same
estimate, is 489 light years. Suppose, says
Mr. Ellison, that instead of being at this en-
ormous distance it were placed in the center of
the solar system, in lieu of the sun. It would
then accupy eigthy-five houndredths of the
space lying within the orbit of Venus, and, as
s en from the earth, would subtend an angle of
about 70 degrees of arc.
