WHO AM I

I am more powerful than the combined
armies of the world. â€™

I have destroyed more than all the wars in
the world. |

I am more deadly than bullets and I have
wrecked more homes than the mightiest of
siege guns.

I steal, in the United States alone,
$3(0,000,000 each year.

I spare no one, and I find my victims among
the rich and poor alike; the young and the old;
the strong and the weak; widows and orphans
know me.

I loom up to such proportions that I cast my
<hadows over field of labor, from turning of the
grindstone to the moving of every railroad train.

I massacre thousands upon thousands of
wage earners in a year.

I lurk in unseen places and .do most of my
work silently. You are warned against me
but you heed not.

[ am relentless. I am everywhere; in the
home, on the streets, in the factory, at rail-
road crossings, and on the sea. 1

I bring sickness, degradation and yet few
seek.to avoid me.

i destroy, crush or maim;
take all. .

I am your worst enemy.

I am CARELESSNESS!
