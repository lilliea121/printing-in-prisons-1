A TRUE FRIEND IN DEED

A writer in one of the current weeklies has
taken up the cause of the friendless prisoners,
in an effort to secure corrospondence that may
cheer and comfort him in his hour of trouble.
In his letter to the editor he makes a plea for
a greater extention of sympatby for the man
behind stone walls, and says: “Oursisa gen-
erous-hearted country, and the sympathy of
our people is easily aroused when cause of dis-
tress are made known to them, giving abun-
dantly of their dollars.

There isa form of distress to which few give
a thought, and for which the writer asks some-
thing far more subtle than money. The writer
appeals in the cause of friendless prisoners, to
whom a word of svmpathy and encouragement
is more than all the dollars in ‘the world. We
allknow how the so-called fr ends depart at the
first sound of reverses and how quickly the
world turns up its nose. Friends are good in
prosperity, but who has not known the far
greater value of a friend in adversity?

We are glad to note this spirit of kindly feel-
ing toward the ‘‘grey brotherhood,”” and sin-
cerely trust that it may be productive of some
real benefit to the needy. Much joy and
happiness to this warm-hearted sympathizer.
