WIRELESS CONTROL OF
- TORPEDOS BY AEROPLANE

Sky Pilot to Guide The Radio Torpedo
From Any Height above The Water

It is announced that wireless control from
an aeroplane of a coast defence torpedo has
been developed it was learned recently, and
patents for the scheme are included in the
Hammond radio-controlled torpedo, right for
the purchase of which the Navy Department
" has asked Congress to appropriate nearly a
million dollars.

Aeroplane control, navy officers explain,
" make it possible for the operator to guide the
radio torpedo through the compressed air motor
of the torpedo giving him a certain guide by
which to steer it against a shipâ€™s hull.

By use of powerful glasses it has been possi-
ble heretofore to control the torpedo from shore
to a distance of nearly 10,000 yards, but the
aeroplane device will now make the missile ef-
fective to the full range of its motor capacity,
or even far at sea if the torpedo is launched
from a swift motor boat within sight of an
ememies ship.

The Hammond plans are now before the
House Fortification Committee, which wlll con-
tinue its detailed consideration of the proposal

to spend more than $80,000,000 on improving -

the coast defence within the next four years.
Brigadier-General Kingman, Chief of Engineers,
and Lieutenant-Colonel Winslow, of the En-
gineer Corps, were before the committee, their
statements dealing with various schemes to add
~ 16-inch guns with an all-round fire to the major
part of the defence. They disclosed thatone of
the belligerent nations of Europe has developed
a 17-inch gun for land use, but no details of its
constructions of performance have been obtain-
ed here.
