CLEAR AWAY MISUNDERSTANDINGS

There can be no question that there are but
few misunderstandings that will outlast a per-
sonal meeting and a sincere heart-to heart talk.

It is a comparatively easy matter to write a
partial apology, but to do so usually tends to
tangle ourselves into all kinds of snarls and
misunderstandings, and the more we may wiite
the worse the tangle becomes. This leads us
to believe that the very best way to straighten
out snarls is to arrange for a talk, and settle
matters in a reasonabie way. When we talk,
what we say is in part explained by the expres-
sion of our faces—it can be read in the light of
the eyes and in the smile—and we can see at
once whether our meaning is made clear, or,
whether it is misunderstood, by the way in
which it is received.

When we write to another the words stand
alone for themselves, and sometimes a word
may mean any one of several things. So that
it would do us all good if we were to go at least
halfway in a sincere and frank spirit to meet
and shake hands with one another and say
what is really so. As a sage once remarked,
““life is too short to be wasted in petty mis-
understandings,”” and especially those ap-
proachable by a personal meeting, which would
enable one to clear away all clouds of doubt
and unnecessary animosities.
