JOHN SCOTT Overseer John Scott, who for the past twenty two years was employee of the State at this institution, passed away at his home in this city, last Wednesday. The deceased had been ailing for some time prior to his death, so that his taking away was not wholly unexpected. He was a member of a number of fraternal organizations. His funeral took place from his late residence on Aspen St., on Saturday last.
