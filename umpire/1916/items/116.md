Second Raise In Wages For 8,000 Workers

The Scoville Manufacturing Company of
Waterbury, Conn., recently gave its employes,
numbering over 8000, a second bonus of 5 per
cent. on their wages since October 1.

An increase from 1914 to 22 cents an hour
for common labor at its Pueblo steel plan was
announced at the general offices of the Colo-
rado Fuel and Iron Company at Denver, Col.
Other hourly rates and some tonnage schedules
are being worked out.
