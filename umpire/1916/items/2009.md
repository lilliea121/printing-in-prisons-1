ON THINKING GLAD

Never mind a change of scene— 
Try a change of thinking. 
What if things seem sordid, mean, 
What’s the use of blinking? 
Life’s not always storm and cloud, 
Somewhere the stars are shining. 
Try to think your joy out loud,
Silence all repining. 

By degrees, by thinking light, 
Thinking glad and sweetly, 
You’ll escape the stress of night, 
Worry gone completely. 
Get the habit, looking for 
Sunbeams pirouetting. 
Tapping gayly at your door— 
Surest cure for fretting. 

Needn’'t fool yourself at all,
For there’s no'denying 
E’en above a prison wall 
Song and birds are a-flying, 
Wherefore hearken to the song. 
Never mind the prison,
And you’ll find your soul ere long 
Unto freedom risen. 

—John Kendrick Bangs
