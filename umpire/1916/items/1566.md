To show what a nice, law abiding spirit some of our large corporations have we note the following case: It seems that the Otis Manufacturing Company, of New Orleans, La., were unwilling to comply with the new seaman's act, which recently became operative. So they transferred their two large steamers from American to Nicaraguan registry, and thereby evaded complying with United States law. Probably this same firm would be quick to holler "mutiny" in case of a strike among their seamen.
