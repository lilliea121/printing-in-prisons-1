HAVE THE RIGHT SPIRIT Let all who can, start right. by getting up right in the morning, and the same at night, by going to bed with right thoughts in mind. Be able to start with a feeling of joy in your heart, of hope in the future, of good intent toward others. If the day be dark and dreary, forget it; you can lighten it up with a little cheerful thought. If the day is bright and full of sunshine, you can add to it by giving a word of comfort, a pleasent greeting, or a friendly handshake to some one who is feeling downcast. If you have enemies—and most of us have— and they speak ill of you, pass it by and try to forget and forgive them How nice it would be if all of us would try to bear in mind that real happiness is from within and not from without. If we did so, there would be a source of much joy and comfort in every heart, and the sun would always shine even though the day was dark and dreary.—B 7401.
