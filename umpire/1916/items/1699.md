THINK SUCCESS AND WIN

It is not uncommon to hear complaints about the difficulty of getting along in the world and many other weak-kneed remarks of a similar nature, all of which are educed by a lack of perception as to what is going on about us every day. Show me the case of a man who has really made good without struggles, suffer- ing and hardships. As a fact they are not to be found. Every bit of success in life means work, endeavor to get along in spite of that which may be just ahead.

To make up your mind that there is no use in further trying and that you will wait for some opportunity to come along, is to court failure. It would be better to call out the re- serves and have the whole force club you into action of some kind. If you have the faintest idea that you can make success come to you by sitting down and brooding over your troubles, while others of energy and snap are working earnestly to make ends meet, you will have an- other guess coming.

The most helpful thought is to have the mind ready and willing to accept whatever comes, willing to fight long and hard for any cause that will bring you near the goal of success.

With such an attitude of mind to face the future, there can be but one result, and that will be to come out a winner.
