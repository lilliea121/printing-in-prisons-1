DEUTSCHLAND REPORTED NEARING HOME PORT

It is reported by wireless that the Deutschland is hitting it up for her home port and that she’s nearly there. When last seen on the night of August 8 she was speeding straight ahead. She merely disappeared and dived beneath the ships of the Alljes, Because of her dirty green and white streaked hull she resembled an ordinary wave.

Watching the U-bout from the ships deck for several hours—that is, we watched her through marine glasses, but she seemed suddenly to evaporate. Her green paint worked wonders.
