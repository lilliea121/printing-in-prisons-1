SONG SERVICE ON THE CENTER The members of the inmate choirs and orchestra again gave good evidence of their ability to render tuneful music and sacred song most effectively under the leadership of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, on Sunday afternoon last. The Song Service was fully up to the standard in volume and evenness of tone, which would indicate that the men were sincerely interested in their efforts to produce good music. The hymns, "Lifetime is Working time," "Saving Grace," "All is Forgiven," and "Because He Loved Me So," seemed especially well sung, while Mendelsohn's March from "Athalia" and Bizets "O Lamb of God," proved to be effective as orchestra numbers. The introduction of the solo, "In the Garden of my Hart" by B 7591 was a pleasent addition to the program and we hope to hear more from him in the future. At the conclusion of the service, Chaplain Joseph Welch address the men in an earnest plea to profit by the present opportunity offered and learn to sing from the heart as well as with the voice. The Chaplain also laid stress on the fact that failure to heed the promptings of the heart to do good, would surely result in heavier punishment in time to come, as the immutable law of justice cannt be evaded.
