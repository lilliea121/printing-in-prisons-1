THE GOAL
Heart-Friend God strech down Thy loving hand,
Close clasp my own in Thine.
I am bewildered in the darkness,
And the rugged way is steep.
I only know afar there lies a dazzling summit 
The Goal––our Home––
Where we shall see Thee face to face at last,
Dear Christ, our God.
And so I climb and fall; and rise and climb again,
–And so on–and on.
But wilt Thou clasp my up-reached hand.
O Heart-Friend God!
Throughout the velvet darkness and silence of the night
I hear, I feel i know Thy answer–"Yes."–
O Christ, Thy Love of God
Made visible to man.
