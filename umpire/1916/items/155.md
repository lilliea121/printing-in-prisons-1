FOR CHARTING ALASKA BAY

The U. S. and Geodetic Survey had just
awarded a contract for the construction of a
1000-ton steamer, to be used in surveying the
dangerous waters of Alaska and Bering Sea
The: vessel, which is to be named the “‘Sur-
veyor, ’ will accommodate a crew of sixty-six
officers and men and will cost with her equip-
ment, $220,000. Strange to say, the construct-
ion of this vessel, destined for service in Alaska,
has been undertaken by a firm at Manitowoc,
Wis., on Lake Michigan.
