"THAT WHICH WAS LOST WAS FOUND”

An unusual story came to light recently which has something of a moral in the lesson which it teaches.

As the story goes, it seems that some years ago an old man in New Jersey found $5,000 scattered in bills of large denomination through the family Bible. In 1874 this man’s aunt died and a paragraph of her will read as follows: “To my beloved nephew I will and bequeath my family Bible and all its contents, with the residue of my estate after my funeral expenses and just and lawful debts are paid.” The estate amounted to only few hundred dollars, which were soon spent, and her nephew, neglecting to read the Bible, did not find the treasure put there for him. He lived in poverty all that time, and it was while packing up his things to remove to his son’s home for the remainder of his days that he discovered the money.
