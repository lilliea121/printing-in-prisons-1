UNKNOWN BENEFACTORS

Apart from the sheer human wonderaroused
by the wireless telephone communication with
Honolulu, the most remarkable fact seems to
be that this application of research has -been
car.ied out by a business corporation, says the
“New Republic,”” and that the inventors and
scientists remain anonymous. As evidence of
human motive there is much to think about
here. Whatis the incentive which impels these
unknown workers, what secret have these cor-
porations discovered which enables them to tap
so inexpensively the most useful minds in
America? When next we read that the enter-
prise would collapse with dazzling rewards,
that human nature is so and so, we shall not
be able to refrain from thinking of these name-
less benefictors of mankind. Their incentive
seens some10w to be as good as those of the men
who are piling up fortunes in war speculation,
or of those who had grandfathers with a vision
of rcalestate devlopment.
