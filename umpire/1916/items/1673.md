RESTLESSNESS
Ferryman' row me across.
The flowers look bright on that
side.
The stones less rought that lie along its shore,
And there, they tell me, birds sing ever-
more:
Ferryman, row me across.
Ferryman, row me across.
Here are the same old sorrows as of yore,
Among those newer beauties I would hide;
Heed not, I pray, an adverse wind or tide,
Ferryman, row me across.
Ferryman, come, row me home.
I cannot, 'mid these scenes so strange,
abide:
Mine eyes grow dim, and in my heart's deep core
I long for old familiar things once more–
E'en though they be the sorrows known of yore,
Kept ever green by graves of those who died–
Ferryman, quick, row me home!
