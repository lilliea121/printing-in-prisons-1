NOT DRINKING ANYMORE
She wears the smiles of morning now,
And where the wrinkles trod her brow
The roses smile and violets tread,
And even the snow upon her head
Is turning gold as of old,
In all its girlish youth of gold;
And all she says–-there is the door–
Is: He's not drinking' any more!"
His little breeches are not worn,
Nor hair unkempt, nor stockings torn;
His little cheeks are not so thin,
The shadow of another's sin
No longer hovers where he goes
In playtime of childhood's rose;
His hunger and his gried are o'er–
"Our father doesn't drink no more!"
A ray of silver in the sun,
Comes trippling in a little one,
Full of the grace, the flow, the swirl
Of life and laughter of the girl.
Her old, torn dress of calico
Has been discarded long ago,
And sweet and glad she sings the lore–
"Dear paper doesn't drink any more."
