UP TO YOU 
Thomas F. Porter 

You may attend the best schools in the land, 
Have teachers who by you their duty do, 
But just how in your studies you may stand 
In the long run, is wholly up to you.

You may have friends to counsel and advise 
Who mark the course you should e’er pursue, 
But if you fall, or if you upward rise, 
In the long run is wholly up to you. 

At times most of us need a little aid, 
And this desire too often in us springs;
But who to trust himself is half afraid, 
In the long run, will win but little things.

Men may the needed capital supply 
To start you in some tempting enterprise, 
But if you wholly on their aid rely, 
Failure along you pathway surely lies.

You may assistance have in any course 
That you attempt as life you travel through, 
But, as you must supply the power and force, 
What you shall win, and be, is up to you.

While worthy aid and counsel is all right, 
Be to your best desires and wishes true; 
And be yourself the leader in the fight, 
Because, in the long run, ’tis up to you.
