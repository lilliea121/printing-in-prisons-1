DEFECTIVE SIGHT CAUSE OF CRIME

Convinced by general observations during a considerable period of time, as judge of the court of general sessions in New York, a prom- inent jurist of that state declares that ‘‘bad eyes make bad men. While this may appear to be a novel idea to some, I do not hesitate to say that the man who cannot see straight can- not think straight nor act correctly.”” Con- tinuing, he said that a large percentage of the persons brought before him for sentence, have defective eyesight, and this he firmly believes, is mainly responsible for their criminal tenden- cies and moral delinquencies.

Unquestionably poor eyesight has a depress- ing effect upon the mind and is injurious to the general health; that it would pervert the mind from normal thought, should occasion no sur- prise. The judge holds to his theory, saying that he is able to back it up with convincing proof, and that ‘‘one of the first steps which should be taken by the state in the correction of law breakers, ought to be the careful exami- nation and treatment of their eyes.’’
