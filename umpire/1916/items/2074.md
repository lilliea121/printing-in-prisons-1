SIMPLY LOSING THEIR HEADS

The Milwaukee Sentinel observes that “most recent orders of the British Government limits the amount of foodstuffs that may be imported by the neutral nations of Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Norway to an amount which British officials estimate is the normal consumption of those countries. The neutrals are told how much they may buy and other neutral nations how little they can sell. There will be no real pretense made that this is not a gross violation of the rights of all neutral nations. Thus to interfere with the commerce of a friendly people is an act whlch can rightly be considered hostile. The old plea of military necessity will reappear, but the plea is getting worn out. Great Britain’s ministers are simply losing their heads.”
