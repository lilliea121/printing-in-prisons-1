ALL RECORDS BROKEN AT MINT

It is announced that October was the busiest month in the history of the U. S. Mint in Philadelphia, the output reaching the tremendous total of 45,231,413 coins. This is more than one-fourth of the average yearly output of the last four years. The annual production has ranged around 150,000,000 pieces.

In the October production were included some millions of the latest edition of the dime, which went into circulation a few days ago.
