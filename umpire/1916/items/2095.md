THE EIGHT-HOUR DAY

The editor of the Cleveland News scouts the idea that President Wilson "gave us the eight-hour day’’ and says:

"Gave who the eight-hour day? What kind of an eight-hour day? Four hundred thousand trainmen—the highest paid branches of the service—are to get ten hours’ pay for eight hours’ work, under the Adamson bill. They do not get an eight-hour day; there was no intention that the bill should provide for an eight-hour day. And 1,400,000 other railway employes whose average pay is around $2.80 a day get nothing. Everybody favors a real eight-hour day wherever it is practica- ble. Why did Wilson hand labor this Adamson ‘gold brick’ at the point of a shotgun and then try to set up that it is an eight-hour day? Labor ‘bunked again,’ that’s all.”
