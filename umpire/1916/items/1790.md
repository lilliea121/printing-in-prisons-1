A New York report states that within the next month copper producers expects to see some of the greatest orders placed in the country that the trade has everrecorded. It was learned yesterday that a group of English manufacturers of war munitions, copper wire and other products of use to the armics are negotiating an order which may total Â£50,000,000, pounds of the metal, to be delivered in scattered lots throughout 1917.

The largest single contract ever reported be- fore was placed last April through J. P. Morgan & Co. It called for 200,060,000 pounds at cost to the buyer, said to be the British Government of $85,000,000.
