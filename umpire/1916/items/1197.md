THE BRIGHTER DAWNINGBy Martha Shepard LippincottAlthough the world is full of trouble,Keep looking for the brighter day;When clouds of sorrow will be passingAnd peace and joy will come our way,Around the clouds will silver liningsBe shining so that we may see The brighter dawning for the morrow,For mankind will surely be.There ne'er in life will be a night-timeSo dark but day will follow soon;No winter-time so cold and drearBut afterwhile will come sweet June.And so in life there is no sorrowBut what will sometime pass awayWith some bright dawning there'll be comingAround for you, a brighter day.
