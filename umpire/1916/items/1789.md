TAMMANY TO HAVE NEW LEADERâ€”MURPHY TO RETIRE

It is reported by reliable authority that Tammany Leader, Charles F. Murphy, never again will sit as head of the Tammany delegation in a Democratic State convention. The statement is to the effect that the man who for the last 15 years has wielded the sceptre in Tammany Hall without any one ever seriously disputing his leadership is determined to retire on December 31, 1917. It is the fond hope of the Tammany chieftain that by that time he will have added to the list of his political achieved ments a straight-out Tammany victory in a New York city mayoralty campaign

It is expected that when Mr. Murphy retires from leadership he will be succeeded by Sheriff Alfred E. Smith.
