BUILDS MACHINE IN BOTTLES Elam Weller, of Pennsburg, Pa., who is convalescing from paralysis, which kept him in bed for twelve months, has proved himself a genius with a penknife and homemade tools. A spinning wheel, built in a quart bottle having an opening at the neck of one-half an inch, is the accomplishment. One week was required to accomplish the feat. The spinning wheel, which is four inches long and as many high, was passed through the neck of the bottle. The wheel is complete in every detail and is an exact reproduction of a full size machine. There is even a cord connecting the two wheels of the machine and it is possible to operate it with proper tools. The neck of the bottle was closed with a wooden stopper which it is impossible to remove.
