SACRED SONG SERVICE BY E. S. P. CHOIR

The E. S. P. inmate choir and orchestra held a sacred song service on the Center, at this institution, on Sunday afternoon last An excellent program of song and orchestral music was rendered in a manner highly creditable to Conductor A. F. Wiegandt and the men under his supervision.

Several distinctive features marked the event, notably the cornet solo by Professor Wiegandt, the quartette composed of B 7525, 7867, 7825 and 8252, singing ‘‘Brighten the Corner Where You Are,” and the solos by B 7717, 7737 and 4876, each doing nicely with their respective selections.

Chaplain Joseph Welch was on hand to give a short address to the men at the conclusion of the service, his suhject being, ‘‘Doing Something for Others,” which was punctuated with many striking remarks.

For the benefit of our readers the program is printed in full:
