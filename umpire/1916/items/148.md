BUILDS MACHINE IN BOTTLES

Elam Weller, of Pennsburg Pa., whois con-
valescing from paralysis, which kept him in
bed for twelve months, has proved himself a
genius with a penknife and home-made tools.
A spirning wheel, built in a quart bottle having
an opening at the neck of one-half an â€˜inch, is
the ac omplishment.

One week was required to accomplish the
feat. The spinning wheel, which is four inches
long and as many high, was passed through the
neck of the bottle. The wheel is complete in
every detail and is an exact reproduction of a
full size machine. There iseven a cord con-
necting the two wheels of the machine and it
is possible to operate it with proper tools.
The neck of thebottle was closed with a wooden
stopper which it is impossible to remove.
