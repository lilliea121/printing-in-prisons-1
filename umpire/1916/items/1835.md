E. S. P. CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA HOLD SONG SERVICE

Sacred music and song held sway on the Center at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, showing to good advantage the skilful blending of choir and orchestra under the able guidance of Professor A. F. Wiegandt.

The program, consisting of eight numbers, was rendered in a pleasing manner that elicited repeated applause by the assembled guests and inmates, and it would be difficult to say which selection was best, as all were good. ‘‘Rocked in The Cradle of the Deep” was rendered by B 7962 as a baritone solo with good effect.

Chaplain Joseph Welch was present and expressed his satisfaction to the men for their even and tuneful singing. The Chaplain also suggested that it would ‘‘not be difficult to ‘make good’ on the outside if they would continue to do as well as they are now doing on the inside."
