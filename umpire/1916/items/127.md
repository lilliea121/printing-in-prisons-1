CENTENARIANS OF THE NATIONS

Serbia according to statistics printed in Eng-
land, is particularly the country of centen-
arians. In that land one man in every 2,260
has-lived to be 100 yearsold, the total male
centenarian population of Serbia being 575.

Ireland ranks next in the longevity list. In
the Emerald Isle, out of every 8,130 of popu-
lation there is one centenarian, the total
number of centenarians being 578.

Out of every 43,000 Spaniards one is a cen-
tenarian. Norway has twenty-three centen-
arians, or one in about 96,000. England,
Scotland and Wales have about one centen-
arian to every 177,000 of population.

France has 213 centenarians, or one in 180,
750. Sweden ranks seventh with twenty only,
or one in 250,000. Germany has one in 702,
000. Denmark only claims two, or less than
one to 1,000,000 of its population: and Switz-
erland, with all its reputed healthiness, seems
not to possess a single centenarian.
