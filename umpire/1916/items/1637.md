CATHOLIC SERVICES AT THE E. S. P. CHAPEL The Catholic services at the Chapel of this institution was well attended by the inmates on Sunday last, in spite of the high temperature. All were pleased at the return of the Rev. Father Michael A. O'Kane, S. J. who has been absent for several weeks, engaged in special mission work. During the service, Mr. George Diedricht, who has a clear baritone voice of good range and resonance, sang Harvey's "Ave-Maria,' and "O Salutarius" by Lejeal. He was well supported by the choir and orchestra. The sermon was based upon the 5 Chapter of St. Luke; the theme being "Sorrow Turned Into Joy." In concluding, Father O' Kane very aptly expressed his regrets at being oblige to leave his charge for other duties, and his joy of again being with them.
