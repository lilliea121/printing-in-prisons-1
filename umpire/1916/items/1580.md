EPISCOPAL SERVICES AND BAPTISM The regular monthy Episcopal service was held at the E. S. P. Chapel on Thursday last, the Rev. Thomas J. Taylor, assisted by the Rev. H. M. Peck, conducting the service. An edifying sermon was addressed to the inmates with the purport of inducing a higher ideal of life and a desire for moral betterment. The service was well attended and communion was administered to sixty-four inmate members of the church. The choir did well in song, showing improvement under the careful direction of the new choirmaster. In the afternoon, Baptismal services were conducted by the Rev. T. J. Taylor, at which time sixteen inmates were baptized. Chaplain Joseph Welch, Mrs. Keen, Mrs. Connoly and a number of others were present at the services.
