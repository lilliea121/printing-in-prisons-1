EXTENSIVE CIVIC EXPOSITION Preparations are well under way in West Philadelphia for an extensive Civic Exposition which is to be held at the Auditorium Building on 34th, St., below Spruce St., begining May 15, and continuing until June 10th. It is the intention of those in charge of the exposition to give it a wide scope, so as to have on exhibition a representative display of all the industries of the city, which will include, it is expected, the various arts and crafts in extensive array, and no efforts will be spared to make the affair a complete success in every detail. It has been decided upon by the Warden and Officers of the E.S. P. to participate in the exposition by having a representative display of the handicraft of the inmates of this institution on exhibition, and steps have been taken to secure the necessary space at the exposition to carry out their plan. This will be a good opportunity for the inmates of the E. S. P. having saleable articles, to dispose of the same to their profit. Further information may be obtained by inquiring of the Overseers of the various Blocks. who will be able to give the necessary directions to those interested.
