BELT LINE ROAD ADVOCATED Preparedness now seems to be a by-word and many are the schemes advanced by the wiseacres, with the assurance of their efficacy. One of the latest of these suggests that a belt line road be built around the United States, near the seacoast. Such a road would be undoubted value; but enthusiasts in this direction apparently lose sight of the foundamental fact that, either for war or peace, we need good roads everywhere. Another lesson that can be drawn from experience of Europe of late, is to so build the roads that they will stand up in time of need.
