A LOVING TRIBUTE In a humble vine-clad cottage situated in the little town of W———,, there dwells an elderly lady whose life of three score and fourteen years has been burdened with more than the usual amount of lifes' troubles. Yet amid the lights and shadows she has maintained a calm serenity of spirit that is closely akin to the divine. But greatest of all her sorrows was the blow that came when her favorite son was tempted and fell, and became amendable to the laws' stern decree. Here too, her sanitly patience sustained her from despair, and in quietude and hope she awaits the nearing end of worldly griefs and cares. Like a ray of brightest sunshine there came to her on Thursday last, a beautiful bouquet of seventy-four pure white carnations, each one expressive of the love and affection of the son who erred, but never failed in his tenderest love for a devoted mother.
