The only remedy is to come out of one’s self
In order to find peace. We must rehou ce
ourselves, and lose all self interest, that we
may no longer have anything to lose, tn fear
or to contrive. Then we shall enjoy the true:
peace reserved for ‘‘men of gccd will’’; that
is, for those who have no longer any will but
God’s, which becomes theirs. Ther. men will
not be able to harm us: they can no longer

attack us through our hopes or our fears.
— Fenelon
