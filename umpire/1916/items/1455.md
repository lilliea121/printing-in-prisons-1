Hardly a generation ago the metal aluminium was exhibited in classes in chsmistry only in small pieces, as a rarity. Its method of production from the natural source was so difficult and expensive that only small pieces of it were kept on hand for exhibiting as specimens. The change that has taken place in this generation has been so rapid that this may be not improperly called an age of aluminium. During the last year 65,000,000 pounds of aluminium were prepared and used in the world, which was an increase of thirty three per cent over the amount used in the previous year. A considerable proportion of this is used in the production of automobiles.
