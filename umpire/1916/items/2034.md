THE GAME

When the game seems lost and you want to quit, and you’re hanging on by your nerve and grit, and you can’t see an earthly chance to win, and you’re weary and jaded and near “all in,” don’t ever quit as you want to do, but keep your heart till the game is through, till the last hard minute is past and gone— fight on! 

The chaps who win are the boys with pluck who never will quit till the gong is struck, and many and many a game they play is'won at the end of a losing day—won by sticking the struggle out, won by going the whole long rout, while they—though weary in brain and brawn—fight on!

So, though you're staggering, weak and blind, battered in body and dazed in mind, you can’t be sure that the weather man has not dealt out the worst he can, is just as tired and jaded, too, and fully as ready to quit as you—ready to turn and smile and fawn— fight on!

You never know when a panic’s spent— when the hard time’s Jinx’s spirit is bent, it is fast approaching its final end, and it is bending, be sure of that—soon to break or go to the mat. So brace and rally—you’ll soon see dawn—fight on!

— Bill Board.
