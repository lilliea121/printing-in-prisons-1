THE MAN WITH A SMILEThe man who approaches you with a smile on his face, and a tone of cheer in his voice, is always welcome. When we think of such, the worlds of a well known writer comes to mind. "It is the song you sing, and the smiles you wear, that's a-making the sunshine everywhere." And that is true.It has been said that there are three brands of courage. One where we start out with a view of success. The next that stifles a complaint when we trip or fall; and third, the real courage that gauges the real worth of a man; that stiffens his backbone for the effort to begin all over again. If we face our difficulties with a smile and give no though to doubt, or that which has gone before, there will be small chance for failure in the end. It is when we permit the mind to wander back to past illusions or difficulties, that a sense of weakness may come over us; but never so, if we look straight ahead and turn our thoughts into proper channels, that we may see the way clearing before our view. He who hesitates, or looks back is lost. Back the man who faces the future, with a smile and who keeps the golden light of cheer before his mental vision, is bound to Win.
