DOING OUR BEST

Undoubtedly more beautiful sermons are preached at Christmas than at any other time or season. We are loath to believe that the clergy purposely reserve their florid phrases and most appealing thoughts for sermonizing on Christmas Sunday; nor does it seem plausible that they withhold their supreme efforts from their parishioners on other Sundays in order to feast them well at Christmas. Surely it must be that they are indeed stimulated by the true Christmas spirit, inspired by the belief in the greatest of all Christian festivals to do their best—their very best to electrify and charm the listening multitude.

In these times of prosperity to some and misery and sorrow to others there is abundant need of best endeavor to inculcate the teaching of Jesus in the lives of those who seek relief from worldly cares and deeper sorrows. There are many athrist for spiritual food and sympathy, and it is to such that consoling messages of love and tenderness particularly appeal. Itis a sad heart that fails to receive some comforting assurance at Christmas, even ‘‘though the way may be darkened by a passing cloud.” Truly, he who believes in Christmas and its message of love, will do his best to fulfil the law.
