GRAND REVIEW OF 26,000 TROOPS AT EL PASO

Twenty-Mile Parade Includes Second Pennsylvania Regiment

A correspondent at El Paso, Texas, is responsible for the information that National guardsmen and regulars, 26,000 of them in dust-stained khaki—swung through the streets of El Paso and past a reviewing stand at Fort Bliss on Saturday last, in the first parade and review of an infantry division at full war strength ever held in the United States. Military men said that a larger number of troops were in line than at any time in the history of the country, with the exception of the grand review in Washington at the close of the Civil War, May 23 and 24, 1865.

Philadelphia had the only infantry organization in the line of troops, Colonel Hamilton D. Turner’s Second Regiment of 1000 men taking part. Other Pennsylvania troops in line were one battalion of artillery, one battalion of engineers, including Company B, of Philadelphia, and Company L., of the Fourth Regiment. The review lasted five and one-half hours.

Tanned by service on the border, the brownclad legions—cavalry, infantry, field-artillery and auxiliary troops—marched in an unbroken column, nearly twenty miles long. Major-General Charles M. Clement, commanding the Pennsylvania division, and Brigadier-General George Bell, commanding the El Paso military district, reviewed them.
