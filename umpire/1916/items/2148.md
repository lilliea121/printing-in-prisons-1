SOME TIME

Some time we will go, we say,
Where the old true friends await, 
Hopeful that some happy day
They may greetus at the gate; 
Future whispers soft and low: 
“Some time—some time—we shall go!”

Some time we will speak, we say. 
Little words we left unsaid
That might brighten some one’s way— 
Some one’s way that’s dark instead,
Some kind work to help the weak
Some time —some time—we shall speak.

Some time we will do—we say, 
Something we have left undone— 
Shall, obscure in its way, 
Save to some poor toiling one; 
This we promise, fair and true, 
Some time—some time we shall do.

Some time we will wake and know 
Opportunity has fled, 
Gone the friends of leng ago— 
Needless are the words unsaid, 
For, as Time computes her sums, 
Sometimes, Some time never comes! 

—John. D. Wells.
