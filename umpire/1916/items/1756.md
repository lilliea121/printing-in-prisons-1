THE TOWN OF DON'T-YOU-WORRY 

There’s a town called Don’t You Worry, 
On the banks of River Smile,
Where the cheer-up and Be-Happy 
Blossom sweetly all the while,
Where the Never-Grumble flower 
Blooms besides the fragrant Try,
And the Ne’re Give-Up and Patience 
Point their faces to the sky.

In the valley of Contentment, 
In the province of I Will,
You will find this lovely city,
At the foot of No-Fret hill.
There are throughfares delightful 
In this very charming town,
And on every hand are shade trees 
Named the Very-Seldom-Frown.

Rustic benches, quite enticing,
You'll find scattered here and there; 
And to each a vine is clinging
Called the Frequent-Earnest,-Prayer, 
Everybody there is happy,
And is singing all the while, 
In the town of Dont-You-Worry,
On the banks of River-Smile.
