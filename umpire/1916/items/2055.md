Like an old friend, ‘‘always welcome,’’ the October number of Our View Point, of Walla Walla, Wash., has just arrived to lighten our spirits and gladden the heart. Scanning the contents of the current number, we fail to find a mediocre article in its pages. They are all good, which is proof positive that Editor Gordon is a good scout and loyal to his job and clan.
