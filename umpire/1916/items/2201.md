CAROLS AND BAND CONCERT ENLIVEN CHRISTMAS DAY

Christmas morn was ushered in at this institution by inmate choristers singing carois on the Center, which soon awakened the slumbering population from their dreams of feast and plumduff, and daylight quickly followed, with many messages of comforting assurance to the inmates from their outside friends.

Christmas atmosphere prevailed at this in- stitution during the day and the program previously arranged by Prof. A. F. Wiegandt for the Band Concert on the Center, was carried out with unusual perfection in detail and in the selections, calling forth considerable praise from the many visitors present.

The musicians were at their best on this occasion and plainly endeavored to carry out their part in perfecting the spirit of the day. This effect was strengthened by the band marching through the various blocks so all could hear and be cheered by the martial music; and the hearty approval of the inmates was loudly acclaimed by them by shouts of rejoicing.
