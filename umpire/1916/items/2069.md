ANNOUNCEMENT OF COURSE IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING

Mr. Bonsall announces the formation of a new class in the Unversity Extension course of Elementary Mechanical Engineering. The course will consist of Shop Sketching, Elementary  Shop Arithmetic and Advanced Arithmetic.

An advanced course will be taken up later, embracing Algebra, Geometry and Trigonometry. The last class was a high success; nineteen men graduated with high honors and received their diplomas.

The courses are designed with the idea of aiding the practical mechanic to enlarge his knowledge. This is your opportunity to rel- egate the words, "I can’t" and "I don’t know,” to the scrap-heap where they belong.

Send your application for membership through your Overseer to Mr. Bonsall.
