THE ADVANCE OF PRISON REFORM

From various sections of the country there is reported continuous progress with the prison problem, and efforts to provide proper means for the care and advancement of the imprison- ed, showing that the general interest of the thinking public has been aroused to the ne- cessity of logical and sane legislation to better existing conditions and to stamp out the bar- barous methods of the past. Thisis as it should be, and we are pleased to see that the South American countries are awakening to the needs of better and more enlightened treatment of the fallen, as well as their northern brethern.
From late news reports we glean the interest- ing information that the Minister of Justice of Chile, has appointed a commission to make a study of crime in that country, and to present a detailed report to the government, suggesting adequate measures for the control and preven- tion of crime, for reforming delinquents and for the proper classification and separation of prisoners. It is proposed to establish in the new penitentiary at Santiago, a complete lab- oratory of psychology and to have physicians in attendance at all penal institutions, who will be required to give such information or data as may be desired by the commission in connec- tion with the work.

It is to be hoped that the commission will make a complete success along the line of its endeavor, and that we may soon hear of de- cided betterments in prison conditions in that country.
