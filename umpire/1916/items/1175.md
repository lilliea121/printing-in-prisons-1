H. & F. CLUB NOTES By A 8432, B 7927 We beg to announce to the subscribers of the Honor and Friendship circulating library, that anyone wishing a magazine other than those subscribed for, will be able to procure one by notifying the librarian before eleven o'clock in the morning. These will be charged to you at the same rates as your regular books: two cents a day or three days for five cents. If you wish a magazine for Sunday, please notify the librarian which book you would like to have before eleven o'clock Saturday morning. If for any reason you are unable to see the librarian, tell the delegate on your Block, and he will see that you are furnished with a magazine. This week the 7th Block and Gallery go out to the entertainment. Tickets will be given out Saturday at noon.
