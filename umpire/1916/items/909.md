WHO AM I I am more powerful than the combined armies of the world. I have destroyed more than all the wars in the world. I am more deadly than bullets and I have wrecked more homes than the mightiest of siege guns. I steal, in the United States alone, $30,000,000 each year. I spare no one, and I find my victims among the rich and poor alike; the young and the old; the strong and the weak; widows and orphans know me I loom up to such proportions that I cast my shadows over field of labor, from turning of the grindstone to the moving of every railroad train, I massacre thousands upon thousands of wage earners in a year. I lurk in unseen places and do most of my work silently. You are warned against me but you heed not. I am relentless. I am everywhere; in the home, on the streets, in the factory, at railroad crossings, and on the sea. I bring sickness, degradation and yet few seek to avoid me. I destroy, crush or maim; I give nothing, but take all. I am your worst enemy.I am CARELESSNESS!â€”Exchange.
