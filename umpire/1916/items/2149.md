A MUCH NEEDED CHANGE

A much needed change in our laws, that would tend to administer punishment according to degree of the offense committed should be worthy of consideration by all progressive legislators. It is a common occurence to witness judges sending men to prison under excessive sentences, whose guilt was merely of a technical nature. All men in prison are not necessarily criminals, and many never had criminal inclinations. Their downfall, in many cases, was caused by over-ambition to succeed amidst trying circumstances. Because their ventures failed they were branded as being possessed of intention to break the laws. Only men in prison can realize the enormity of such grave mistakes often made by courts. Some provision should be made to obtain relief for those who were unfortunate in falling under the general ban of a law, which was never intended to punish persons who only made mistakes with all intent to do wrong, lacking.
