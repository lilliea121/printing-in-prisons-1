TO BE A LINCOLN
Edward E. Van Zile

Who’d be a Lincoln must be great of soul,
Calm, strong and patient, with a loving heart;

With wide flown vision to embrace the whole;
Not rest too long upon a petty part.

A nation’s leader, with a people rent
In factions bitter and by hatred stirred,
Can be like him, our martyred President,
Only if deeds shall march behind his word.

He waited, Lincoln, till the time was born
When it was well that he should strike the
blow;
He faced contumely and he endured scorn,
But neither went too fast nor went too slow:

Who'd be a Lincoln must both speak and act;
His hand must do what tongue has left un-
done; , :
A Lincoln with his soul must make a pact
To gain from force what kindness has not
