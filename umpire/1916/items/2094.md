AS TO PROBLEMS AHEAD 

Summing up the after election situation in reference to ‘‘problems ahead,” the St. Louis Globe-Democrat says that President Wilson will have to face ‘‘many problems which can not be postponed for four years. Something must be definitely done about the Mexican mess. The trainmen wage question must be settled. All the vexatious controversies. with the European belligerents must be somehow settled. We have diplomatic troubles with Japan, Russia and Colombia. The Danish West Indies deal is in suspense. The problem of foreign trade remains for solution.

“The President is committed to the Webb bill, which would exempt the foreign trade of our corporations from the harsh restrictions of the Sherman act. We believe that its enactment is essential to successful American competition in foreign trade. Some of the hasty legislation of the last Congress must be perfected. The Reserve Act must be modified, to eliminate the dangers Mr. Warburg has pointed out. Then there is the duty of surpassing importance—economic preparedness of the United States for the terrific trade struggle following the European war.”
