STATE COMPENSATION BOARD
MEETS AT HARRISBURG

At a recent meeting of the State Compen-
sation Board at Harrisburg, it was decided that
gratuities received by the workmen in the form
of tips from employer or others is not to be
computed in the wages of a worker in deter-
mining theamount of compensation an injured
employe is to receive under the compensation
law. This applies to waiters, porters
others, the special committee decided today at
a conference to determine what constitutes a
daily and a weekly wage.

Wages paid for overtime work in seasonal em-
plovments will be included in the wage deter-
mination, it was decided. Tools or other mate
rials furnished by the employer to be used by
the employe may be deducted from the wages
unless it is provided in the contract of employ-
ment that the employer shall furnish such
materijals and has the right to deduct the price
from the wages.

A seasonal employment is defined as one
periodically suspended for periods of more than
four weeks, because of conditions in a trade or
industry. In a seasonal trades the employe
must show the total amount he has earned in
all trades for the proceeding year. A referec
may require the employe to verify such state-
ment by word of his emplovers.
