PORTABLE WIRELESS TELEGRAPH

A very interesting mobile wireless telegraph
equipment is being used by the British army.
Four horses carry the equipment. On one is
packed the power plant, another carries the
receiving apparatus, a third horse bears the
transmitting apparatus, while the mast and
accessories are loaded upon the fourth horse.
The power plant is particularly interesting.
The design of the saddle is such as to form a
support for the plant. On one side is mounted
a generator and on the other a small gasoline
engine. After the saddle has been lifted off
the horse and placed on the ground, the engine
and the generator are connected by a shaft. It
takes but a moment to prepare the plant for
work.
