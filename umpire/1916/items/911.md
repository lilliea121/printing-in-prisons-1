TRUE HEROISM It is true that old heroism is dead We shall never again have a Jason felling the pines of Pelion, building ships with highly colored poops, and going forth to strive with snaky dragons in wandering search of the Golden Fleece. We shall never again have gallant knights with ringing gauntlets and jingling spurs going forth in quest of romantic adventure, liberating ladies in distress from donjon towers, or seeking in far off lands for the Holy Grail. These exploits are gone forever with the world's old dreams. But as they have disappeared, a New Heroism has risen for the race. It is by far the greater heroism that goes down to seek and serve in the thick of things where worn men and weary women are caught in folds of the great dragon of social injustice. It is a true heroism that strives to free the poor and misguided captives caught in the great dragnet of greed and graft. Here truly is the field for the great spiritual and moral adventures of the future.
