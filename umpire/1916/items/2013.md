Because of the carpenter work on the chancel of the Chapel, on Thursday last the Holy Communion service was omitted. At 1:30 the usual services were held. Through the courtesy of the Warden and Chaplain the carpenter work was suspended for one hour and the service was conducted by the Rev. T. J. Taylor, assisted by the Rev. Dr. Perry, of Germantown, who preached a clear, earnest sermon from the text, “He is able to save to the uttermost all who come unto God by Him.”
