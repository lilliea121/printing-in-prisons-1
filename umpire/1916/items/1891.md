BRITISH WARSHIP HOLDS UP U. S. VESSEL IN PHILIPPINE HARBOR

According to recent information from Wash- ington, another violation of American neutrality by a British destroyer, which held up and examined the Philippine steamship Cebu within the territorial waters of the Philippines, was reported to the War Department Saturday by Governor-General Harrison. The dispatch will be made the subject of a vigorous protest to Great Britain.

The incident occurred one mile and a half off Carabao Island. Lieutenant Bailes, commanding H. M. S. Destroyer No. 2, boarded the Cebu, made inquiries about her passengers and took both shipsâ€™ manifest and passenger list. Apparently the officer was searching for a man named Bady.

There has been more than one complaint about the activity of British vessels around the Philippines, and it is probable that Great Britain will be called upon to restrict the operations of her patrol in and near the territorial waters.
