CHARACTERISTICS OF WASHINGTON

As a fitting tribute to the memory of George
Washington, whose birthday anniversary  will
be celebrated on the twenty second of this
month, it is most worthy of mention that to
the appointment of Washington as commander-
in-chief of the Continental army, more than
to any other single circumstance, is due the
ultimate success of the American Revolution.
He was punctual, methodical, and exact in the
highest degree, excelled in managing thuse
minute details which are so essential to the
efficiency of an army, and he pos-essed to an
eminent degree not only the common courage
of a soldier, but also that rarcr form of courags
which can endure long-continued suspense,
bear the weight of great responsibility, and
encounter the risks of misrepresentation
and unpopularity. For several years, and
usually in the neighborhood of superior for-
ces, he commanded a perpetually fluctuat-
ing army, nearly destitute of discipline and
respect for authority, torn by violent personal
and provincial jealousies, wretchedly armed
and clothed, and sometimes in imminent dangcr
of starvation. ‘‘Unsupported for the most
part by the population among whom he was
quartered, and incessantly thwarted by-the
jealousy of Congress, he kept his army to-
gether by a combination of skill, firmness, pa-
tience, and judgment which has rarely been
surpassed, and he led it at last to a signal
triumph. In civil as in military life he was
preeminent among his contemporaiies for the
clearness and soundness of his judgment, for
his moderation and self-control, for the quiet
dignity and the indomitable firmness with
which he pursued every path which he had
deliberately chosen. Of all the great men in
history he was the most invariably judicious,
and there is scarcely a rash word or judgment
recorded of him.”” Those who knew him well
noticed that he had keen sensibilities and strong
passions; but his power of self command never
failed him, and no act of his public life canbe
traced to personal caprice, ambition, or resent-
ment,

In the depression of many failures, in the
elation of success, at times when his soldiers
were deserting by hundreds and when malig-
nant plots were formed against his reputation,
amid the constant quarrels, rivalries, and jeal-
ousies of his subordinates, in the dark hour of
national ingratitude, and in the midst of the
most universal and intoxicating flattery, he
was always the same calm, wise, just, and sin-
gle-minded man, pursuing the course which he
believed to be right without fear or favor or
fanaticism; equally free from the passions that
spring from interest, or imagination. ‘“He
never acted on the impulse of an absorbing or
uncalculating enthusiasm, and he valued very
highly fortune, position, and reputation; but
at the command of duty he was ready to -isk
and sacrifice them all. He was, in the highest
sense of the words; a gentleman and a man of
honor, and he carried into public life the se-
verest standard of private morals. It was at
first the constant dread of large sections of the

American people that if the old Government
were overthrown they would fall into the
hands of military adventurers and under-
go the yoke of military despctism It
was mainly the transparent i: tegrity of the
character of Washington that dispelled the
fear. It was always known by his fiiends and
it was soon acknowledged by the whole nation,
and by the English themselves, that in Wash-
ington, America had found a leader who could.
be induced by no earthly motive to tell a false-
hood or to break an engagement or to commit
any dishonorable act.”’ Men of this ‘moral
type are rare, and there is scarcely another in-
stance in history of such a man having reached
and maintained the highest position in the
convulsions of civil war and of a great popular
agitation.
