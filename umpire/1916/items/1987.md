THE TEST OF A MAN

Not by the measure of his deed
Does life make trial of man’s strength; 
Not by his wisdom, nor his creed,
Nor yet by his compassion’s length.

Nor by his span of worldly power, 
Nor even what his truth might dare; 
But ’prisoned in his darkest hour, 
But how much he can bravely bear!
