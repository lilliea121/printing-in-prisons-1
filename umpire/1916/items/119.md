FINE PROGRAM OF SONG

Under the auspices of the American Society
for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, the Ladies of
San Domingo Choral, rendered a splendid Song
Service on the Center, at this institution on
Sunday last.

Those who had the pleasure to be present at
the service were loud in their praise of the
singing.

The next visit of these sweet singers will be
looked forward to with pleasent anticipation.

The anniversary of Lincolnâ€™s birthday will be
celebrated by a Band Concert on the Center.
