Well! here is something that is both pleasing to the eye and to our editorial acumen. The Prison Monitor, of Windsor, Vt., is surely the real article, and no mistake. Among the several excellent articles of the October number may be mentioned ‘‘The Fear That Kills,” “The Benefits of Reform,’’ and the second instalment of ‘‘Stanley’s Yellowstone Expedition.’’

Gray matter and enterprise will surely assert itself, even in a prison paper; and it is evident that Editor Collins has ‘‘the goods.’’
