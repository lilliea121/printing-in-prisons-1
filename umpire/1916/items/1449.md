A GOVERNOR’S PRISON VISIT

A social worker recently made a visit to oneof the Wisconsin state prisons, and was appalled at what he saw and found out. He did not let let matters rest at that however, but took the subjeét up with E. L. Phillips, the millionaire Governor of the state, with the result that the governor went to the prison himselfand madea

thorough investigation, and found that all that

had been told to him was true. Without fur- ther delay he immediately removed the warden and his deputy, and ordered that more humane and modern methods be employed at once.

It is said that the governor’s prison ex- perience will furnish the basis of a thorough system of reform in penal institutions in Wis- consin. The governor’'s quick insight into actual conditions and needs, common sense and loyalty of purpose in the interest of society and suffering humanity are to be commended, and we hope that this instance may serve to focus greater attention to the subject of prison reform methods, so that men may nolonger be put away in state penitentiaries and be for- gotten,or left to deteriorate physically and mentally and then thrown out upon the world as useless, after serving a prison sentence.

That society and the prisoner would be the gainer, both financially and morally, by the general adoption of humane treatment of prison inmates, is beyond question. = The great wonder is that it has taken so long to arouse public interest in so important a matter.
