SUCCESSFULLY PASSES ALL SPEED TESTS Superdreadnought Pennsylvania Above Requirements At Trial Tests It was with pennants flying in the breeze, booms crossed and big banners announcing the speed trials, the Pennsylvania rushed through the Virginia capes at-40'clock last. Friday afternoon, and shortly after 7 o'clock dropped anchor off the shipyards. The builders, navigators and crew were enthusiastic over the showing made and the certainty of the acceptance of the big superdreadnought by the Navy Department. One big banner strung forward was covered by four figures of great size and visible for miles over the water. They were 21.75, indicating the maximum speed attained. The final 12 hour sustained run was made without a hitch, being completed with ease, and was above the minimum of speed and below the maximum of fuel consumption. The report of the Navy Board, which has since been made, was favorable in every respect.
