WHAT MISTAH TROUBLE DID Ol' Mitsah Trouble, he came aroun' one dayAn' say, "I gwinter git you, so you better run away!I likes to see you hustle. Dat's de way I has my funI knows I kin Ketch up to you, no matter how you rin!"I says "Mistah Trouble, you has been chasing meEver since I kin remember, an' I'se tired as I kin be.So I'se gwinter stop right yere, an' turn around, a-facing you,An' lick you if I kin, an' fin' out jest what you kin do."Ol' Mitstah Trouble, he looked mightily ashamed;He acted like a buckin'-hoss dat's suddenly been tamed;An' den he turned an' traveled off, a hollerin,' "Good day;I ain't got time to fool around wif folks dat acts dat wat."â€”Washington Star.
