COLORADO’S EXECUTIVE
OVERRULED BY ASS’T
GOVERNOR

It has recently leaked out that Mrs. Geo. A.
Carlson, wife of the Governor of Colorado,
has asserted her prerogative as ‘‘Assistant
Governor.”” Despite the desire of her husband
and John Vivian, patronage dispenser of the
administration, to remove Thomas Tynan, re-
form warden of the State Penitentiary, ‘‘As-
sistant Governor’’ Carlson has said Warden
Tynan shall stay, and stay he has.

The Warden became a national figure through
inaugurating the ‘‘honor system’’ in penal in-

stitutions. Shortly after the Carlson adminis-.
tration went into office Mrs. Carlson announced
she thought a woman’s place was by her hus-
band’s side and she would be “‘Assistant Goy-
erior ©’ Then one day the Governor told her
he had decided to replace Tynan, with A. C.
Dutcher, a Republican. The Governor went to
his office, where Vivian and Dutcher
the plum.' The Governor was about
the appointment of Dutcher when
Governor’' Carlson sa1d

“You shall not remove Warden Tynan That
is my appointment. : ;

““Very well, my dear,’” said the Governor.

Vivian and Dutcher filed out of the office.
