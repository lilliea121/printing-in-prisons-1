A THOUGHT FOR TODAYThere is always someone to smile at, somebody to give your hand to, some to whom a kind word will help make life more cheerful. These small attentions will open the way to confidence, will make it possible that in need these friends will give you the opportunities to help them which, unless you had shown thoughtfulness and regard for them they could never have done. A quiet, kind, gentle word or a manly, sincere, hand clasp, many a time unbars a heart that needs help which you can give. B 7819.
