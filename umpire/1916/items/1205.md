FROM "OUR FARM" POET The patients in the tuberculosis hospital, desire to express their hearty appreciation for the kindness of the Warden, and Doctor, in furnishing seed for our "farm" during the coming season. Last year we raised a good crop of onions, tomatoes, red beets, salads, parsnips, and radishes. This year we expect to raise a banner crop of the same vegetables. If you want to see a truck farm, Where things are up to date; Where the farming is intensive, And the crops are never late, Just drop into the "con yard," And cast your eyes around; You will see our beets and onions,Fairly jumping out the ground. B 7772.
