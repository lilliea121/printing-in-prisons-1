AS OTHERS SEE HIM

It is the unexpected little things in life that shows the true man after all. Relating an inci- dent which happened recently, a New York paper states that when Charles Evans Hughes, Re- publician norninee for President was on his way to his country place, he left the dcor of his drawing room in the car open, to obtain a bet- ter circulation of air. Mr Hughes was reading a magazine and had an auto cap pulled over his eyes, when two young men on a week-end vacation walked in, inquiring, ‘‘Is this the smoking compartment?’’

“‘Sit down,’’ answered Mr. make yourselves comfortable.’’

They did.

A half hour later some one walked in and greeted Mr. Hughes, expressing the hope that he would be the next President. The two young men, recognizing the candidate for the first time, began to apologize. Pressed to finish their smoking, they returned thanks and quickly backed out, much abashed.

Why be embarrassed?’’ one of them was asked afterward. '

“Well,”” was the answer, ‘‘we discussed - politics, and—well, we are not Republicans.”’
