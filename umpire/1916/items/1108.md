JUST GOING ON "There is light at the end of the darkest path. The clear light of dawn follows every night. Somewhere, some day, there will be God's hand stretched across all the failures, all the heartaches, all the sins, giving to your heart and mine a fuller life and bigger powers, if only one step after another, just on."
