Senator Vare Tells Business Men 'S_i]f-
ferage ls Dead

Senator Edwin H. Vare asserted woman suf-
frage is dead in this State, in a speech at the
annual banquet of the Cohecksink Business
Men’s Association, held at the Hotel Washing-
ton, in this city. The Senator declared he was
no longer interested in woman suffrage, and
didn’'t care whether the majority of women
wanted it or not. He said it was a matter that
was for the male voiers to say whether ‘their
women should have the vote.”” He remarked
that the last election showed clearly that it
was not wanted.

The Senator devoted some attention to the
‘plain people.”” He said they were behind all
the good legislaticn we had secured in the last
four years.
