NEW SECRETARY SAYS HE "HAS GREAT DEAL TO LEARN" The newly appointed Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, ex-Mayor of. Cleveland, O., left that city on Friday of last week for Washington, to take the oath of office and enter upon his duties in that capacity. Mr. Baker occupied much of his time for the last few days in receiving the congratulations of his friends and shaping his private affairs with reference to his absence from Cleveland. To some of his friends Mr. Baker said jokingly just before leaving: "I shall have a great deal to learn. When a boy I never played with tin soldiers." It is said that while Mr. Baker was City Solicitor of Cleveland, that he was considered to be a man of exceptional legal ability, and business acumen. It is expected that he will prove to be well fitted for his new position, though experience in military matters have been lacking.
