MOST POWERFUL U. S. WARSHIP PLACED IN COMMISSION A dispatch from Boston, Mass., states that the superdreadnought Nevada, the most powerful American warship ready for action, was placed in commission at the Charleston Navy Yard, on Saturday last. The Nevada adds a tonnage of 27,500 to the United States navy and an armament of 10-14-inch guns, which constitutes her main battery. In the absence of her commander, Captain William F. Sims, the signal for hoisting the national flag and the commissionship was given by Commander J. F. Tompkins, executive officer of the ship. The orders placing the Nevada in commission were read by Lieutenant Commander Hasbrouck, first aid to Captain William Bush, commandant of the yard.
