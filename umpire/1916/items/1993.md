CHICAGO TO HAVE $20,000,000 STATION

Late Chicago reports are to the effect that a steel and granite structure, 700 by 400 feet in dimensions, with a facade of columns that it is intended shall surpass in size and beauty any similar architecture in the world, with observation towers overlooking a beautiful harbor, groves and a sanded bathing beach, are included in the plans partially revealed for the new Illinois Central passenger terminal. Architects and others who planned the new station aim to make it the largest and finest railroad terminal in the world. No estimate of the total expenditure has been announced, but it is estimated that the site and buildings may cost $20,000,000.
