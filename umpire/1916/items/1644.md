PUBLIC DEFENDER A SUCCESS The office of Public Defender which was established about two years ago in a western city, seems to have proven a success, says a writer in a recent publication. Commending the work of this newly created office the correspondent goes on to say that conditions have been worked out to a better advantage than was expected; that the Public Defender and the District Attorney are now working in perfect co-operation. The principal objection advanced to a Public Defender was that the district attorney and the defending attorney of the state would to a degree come in conflict, in carrying out the duties of their respective offices. This seems not to be the case however, as proven by the words of a State official who says that they "have been able to do what the district attorney has repeatedly tried to do in many cases, but what, owing to certain conditions which could not be overcome, he was unable to do." "To facilitate matters we always advise the defendant to be frank and truthful in their statements to us, that we may be the better able to advise the accused as to their advantage and rights. In informing them of the law relating to the crime of which they are charged, we hear their side of the story and endeavor to bring out such points as may be favorable to the defendants, but in no sense do we try to stay the proper administration of justice."As understood, the clients seeking aid from the Public Defender, are such as are unable to pay for the services of an attorney in the defense of their case, and instead of giving up hope of obtaining justice, or making a plea of guilty as the best way out of a bad predicament the poor may now feel that their interests will be fully protected in conformity to the law. In certain cases, a plea of guilty is advised, as the better course to pursue and the safest way to obtain due consideration of the trial judge, and in nearly every case where this has been done the defendant has received a lighter sentence than he—or she—would have received had they attempted a defense. By being present in court, ready to assist in the Court's affairs, and in endeavoring to secure the dismissal of certain cases through conference with the prosecuting attorney, the Public Defender has enabled the commonwealth to save both time and money. This is a matter that should merit the attention of both the taxpayer and legislators, and we hope in the near future to hear of other favorable reports where the Public Defender has made a complete and satisfactory success of his office.
