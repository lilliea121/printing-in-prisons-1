An eight-year old New York girl appeals to Santa Claus to bring her a doll and she directs her letter to Police Commissioner Woods. And so the commissioner is planning a Christmas tree in every one of the precinct stations. May Sorrell, who wrote the letter, will receive the doll, and her sick papa will be given all the help he needs.
