Following in the wake of the Public Defender ideae, a Kansas law maker is about to present a bill to the legislature of that state, creating the office of Public Attorney, to whom could be submitted all questions of law by the poor and unfortunate of a community, and who would prossecute all cases where one of the litigants ad no funds. At a former session of the legislature a bill of similar nature was introduced, but failed to pass because it was such a novel innovation. It is said that from present indications the bill has a good chance of passing.
