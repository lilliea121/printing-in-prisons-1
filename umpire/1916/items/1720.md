CATHOLIC SERVICES AT THE E. S. P. CHAPEL

Catholic mass was celebrated at the E. S. P. Chapel on Sunday last by the Rev. Father Michael A. Oâ€™Kane, S. J., and the serivice was well attended by the inmates numbers of the church.

In spite of the withering heat cof the day, the altar was profusely decorated with a fine array of beautiful flowers, which added to the splendor of the service.

The music of the mass was cleverly executed by the choir and orchestra, and their hormoni- ous unity occasioned considerable praise from the visitors present.
