CHEERING SOMEONE ON

Don’t you mind about the triumphs, 
Don’t you worry after fame
Don’t you grieve about succeeding, 
Let the future guard your name.
All the best in life’s the simplest, 
Love will last when wealth is gone; 
Just be glad that you are living, 
And keep cheering someone on.

Let your neighbors have the blossoms, 
Let your comrades wear the crown; 
Never mind the little set-backs
Nor the blows that knock you down. 
You'll be there when they re forgotten, 
You’ll be glad with youth and dawn, 
If you just forget your troubles
And keep cheering scmeone on.

There’s a lot sorrow round you,
Lot of lonesomeness and tears;
Lots of heartache and of worry
Through the shadows of the years.
And the world needs more than triumphs; 
More than all the swords we’ve drawn, 
It is hungering for the fellow
Who keeps cheering others on.

Let the wind around you whistle, 
And the storms around you play; 
You’ll be here with brawn and gristle
When the conquerors decay. 
You’ll be here in memories sweetened 
In the souls you've saved from pawn 
If you put aside the victories 
And keep cheering someone on.
