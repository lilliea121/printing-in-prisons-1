NEW GOLD DISCOVERY IN ALASKA Recent reports from the interior of Alaska indicate that another rich gold strike has been made there. Shafts yielding as high as $2 to the cubic foot have been opened at one place, the reports say. Hundreds of miners have been hurrying from Fairbanks and other points to the Innoko districts where the pay streaks are reported to have been found.
