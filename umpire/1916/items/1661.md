GREAT ADVANCE IN PRISON METHODS

Practical System for Study of Crime to be Introduced â€“ Rockfeller Foundation Contributes Funds for Clinic 

As a beginning of the broad innovations which are about to be introduced at Sing Sing prison, a complete psycopathic clinic will be installed and all incoming prisoners and those already within the walls will undergo a throrough mental examination. The feeble minded and mentally deficient will be separated fro the normal group. 

This clinic will be the first of the sort in the United States. As the first move, Dr. Bernard Gluck, a specialist of international fame, will be installed at the prison next week as a resident physiatrist. Unlimited opportunity will be afforded to study the underlying causes of crime. 

The Rockfeller Foundation has contributed the funds for the clinic, and physiatric work is only the forerunner of a plan which the reinstated warden is having prepared by the National Committee on Prisons, for turning the prison into a great  receptive station where prisoners can be observed, classified, and treated according to their needs.
