When will supposedly sensible people realize that learning does not necessarily imply or ensure upright living? It is true that more is to be expected of the so called educated man. But we are deceived right here. We are prone to think that a man is educated who becomes a veritable encyclopedia, even though he may be devoid of all true principle. Even supposing the man who "knows it all'? really has imbibed some religious knowledge, that is no sign that he will make it practical. For we find only too often from experience that knowledge is but a power wielded for destruction rather than construction. And that is because we are not educated to subjugate mind to conscience. â€”The Castle.
