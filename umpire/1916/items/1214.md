FLORIDA PLANNING GREAT. EXPOSITION FOR 1919 From late reports we learn that Florida does not intend to be outdone by California, her western rival, in fruits, flowers and sunshine, and so is going to have an exposition. It will be a centennial and will be held in 1919. Plans proposed include the issue of bonds for preliminary work to the extent of $2,000,000; city, county and State to bear shares, and the call has gone forth to all the people of all west and north Florida to attend a convention at which the details will be mapped out. Every effort will be made to have the people of the State devote their energies largely to the building of a perfect system of highways, on a scale never before attempted, and such as will attract motorists from all over the country. Tampa is the centre of the highway progress, Hillsborough County being the first to vote a million dollars in bonds for brick roads outside that city.
