JAMES P. LAFFERTY

We are sorry to learn of the sudden passing away of James P. Lafferty, managing editor of The Catholic Standard and Times, who died at Wildwood on Saturday last. Mr. Lafferty was well known as a lawyer, journalist, and a popular member of a number of social organizations. He was also interested in prison welfare work, and had manifested his interest by numerous visits to this institution.

Mr. Lafferty leaves a wife and four children, besides a host of friends, who will mourn his loss.

We extend our sincere sympathy to the bereaved wife and family of the deceased.
