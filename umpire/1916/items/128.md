USUALLY MEANS WAR

A rather fine distinction has been drawn be-
tween the ‘‘severance’of diplomatic relations’’
and a “‘declaration of war.”” The distinct im-
pression has been given to the public that the
former course could he adopted without involv-
ing the latter, but as this question is apt to
recur from time to time, it might be well to
state the fact that diplomatic relations have
never been severed, without war as a conse-
quence. Moore’s Digest, one of the leading
authorities on international law, sets forth not
a single case where the severance of diplomatic
relations has not beenfollowed by war. It has
heen pointed out that diplomatic negotiations
were broken off with Mexica. without the se-
quence of war This, however, is not true.
Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson did not ask
for his passports. He merely returned to the
United States.
