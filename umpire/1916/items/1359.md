TO BUILD BIG PLANT ON PETTY'S ISLAND The Westinghouse Company to Erect $1,000,000 Concern on Tractâ€”Will Employ Many Thousands From reliable resources it is reported that the Westinghouse Electric Company of Pittsburg, will shortly build a $1,000,000 plant on Petty's Island in the Delaware, opposite Cramps' shipyard. The island, which comprises about 350 acres and is a part of Pensauken township, Camden County, has been sold by David E. Dallam, who took it over by foreclosure about a year ago, to A. M. Zane, who is said to represent the Westinghouse Company. All of the parties of the transaction preserved great secrecy as to the identity of the real purchasers, though the question of building a bridge from the mainland to the island was freely discussed with the township commissioners. During the discussion it was stated that a very large plant was to be built on the island which probaly would give employment to several thousand men.
