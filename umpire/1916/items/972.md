Food Exports Last Year Was $1,000,000,000 Export figures made public lately by the Department of Commerce at Washington D C., show that as a result of the war, Europe's 1915 food bill in the United States approached one billion dollars. Records for eleven months ending December 1, indicate that more than $800, 000,000 worth of food left American shores during the year, nearly three times as much as in 1913, the year before war began. Food exports began to grow soon after war was declared, and the last six months of 1914 saw bread shipments alone reach the value of $300,000,000, five times the value of shipments during the six months preceding the war. Last year bread shipments passed the $500,000,000 mark.
