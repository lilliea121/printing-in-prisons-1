THE SEASON'S GREETINGS
A CHRISTMAS VISION
By John Kendrick Bangs

On Christmas Eve 'mid all the joyous glee
That in my plenteousness surrounded me,
I happened by some chance to turn mine eye 
Out through a window-wreath that hung near by. 
And as I glanced through it into the night
I seemed to see, lit by some holy light,
A childish face with wistful, smiling lips
That thrilled me to my very finger-tips.

Two eager hands stretched forth called, as in stress,
To me to carry help to Helplessness
And in the sad eyes of that child I saw
In all its loveliness the Christmas Law—
Not a command, no everlasting must
Upon Reluctance for its teaching thrust,
But just a pleading hint to him who runs
That all who suffer are God's Little Ones!

And then the picture in the wreath was gone,
And in its place the Eastern Star-beams shone—
The same that nineteen centuries ago
Led on the Wisemen with their heavenly glow;
And e'en as they I wandered through the drifts
And into lowly places carried gifts
To cheer, and give release, and pay my due
Unto my Lord thro' them that suffer rue.
