STANDARDS

A Standards is a rule of conduct which we lay down as a permanent guide. Every stand- ard differs from every other standard. Some- times the difference is very narrow; sometimes it is very wide. Germany has a standard. England has a standard. America has a stand- ard. Your next door neighbor has a standard. You have a standard. The difference between them is often the difference between peace and war.
