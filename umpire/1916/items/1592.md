THE PATH OF THE PILGRIM By Janet Thurber Never to lose in the seeking The sight of the goal to attain, Never to pause in the working Though the labor bring bittesest pain. Only to hear on the night wind The voice that has call at dawn, Never to sink or be weary With doubts of the swift-coming morn. Never to falter from fearing, Never to cease to desire, Never to stumble from watching The light from a wandering fire. Always to follow and strive Holding your faith for your star, Knowing the spirit of love Worketh wherever you are.
