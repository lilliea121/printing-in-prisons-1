KENTUCKY'S GOVERNOR URGES REFORMS Laws Advocated to Control Trusts and Abolish Prison Labor Governor A. Q. Stanley, in his message to the State Legislature, which recently convened in biennial session, advocates that a law be enacted abolishing State prison contract labor and the employing of prisoners on highways, as the State Constitution provides. The Governor called attention to the antiquated system of handling prisoners, and advised that modern methods be adopted in that State. Governor Stanley also recommends the enactment of a more adequate and stringent antitrust act; and the enactment of a corrupt practices measure, in order that the people may know "what amounts are spent by candidates and by campaign committees for the purpose of controlling elections."
