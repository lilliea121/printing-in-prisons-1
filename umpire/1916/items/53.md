PERSEVERANCE

Of all the virtues, what one stands us in
better stead than perseverance? What is a
greater aid in living? It is the combination
patience and belief. It is not mere fortitude
for it means positive happiness Many of the
worst evils of life come from fainthcartedness,
or from lack of purpose. Few who keep per-
sistenly at a thing, with faith in its value, are
unhappy. What the Scientists have made pop-
ular is a truth that most profound moral think-
ers haveemphasized. Samuel Johnston, with
pardonable exaggeration, said that great works
were preformed not by strength but by per-
severance; and while the current: sayxng about
â€˜genius being an infinite capacity for taking
pains is less than half a truth, Disraeli was at
least safe when he declared patience a neces-
sary ingredient of genius. The patience of
genius, however, is not passive, but active. [t
is not merely endurance but hoyjeful dlhgence
Perseverance is faith expressed in action and

to active faith happiness and value are possible
to the end.
