Seven Wonders Of The Modern World From a thousand prominent scientists in America and Europe lists were obtained recently in which were set forth what, in the opinion of each, are the Seven Great Wonders of the modern world. Nearly one-fourth named as first and most important wireless telegraphy. The telephone was the second selection As for third place, there was a difference of opinion. Some thought it should be awarded to the aeroplane while others thought it should be awarded to radium. The spectrum analysis was placed fifth, with X-ray sixth and the Panama Canal seventh. Anesthesia was mentioned by many of the scientists voting, but not enough ballots were cast in its favor to insure its being included in the final list.
