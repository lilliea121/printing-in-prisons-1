A new type of car wheel, designed to be as nearly noiseless as possible, consists of a wheel within a wheel, the two being separated by a layer of rubber which serves to absorb the shocks Among the advantages claimed for the wheel which is being tried out on a number of railroads are that, besides being practically noiseless, it is more durable than ordinary wheels, reduces shocks on rolling stock and rails and adds to the comforts of passengers.
