The only remedy is to come out of oneself in order to find peace. We must renounce ourselves, and lose all self-interest, that we may no longer have anything to lose, to fear or to contrive. Then we shall enjoy the true peace reserved for "men of good will"; that is, for those who have no longer any will but God's, which becomes theirs. The. men will not be able to harm us: they can no longer attack us through our hopes or our fears.â€” Fenelon.
