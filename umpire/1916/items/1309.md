With a splendid record of over forty years devoted service to his parish at Clarion, Pa., there passed away last week, the Rev. Father H. A. Deckenbrock, who was most favorably known throughout the western part of this state as a gifted and scholarly priest, and as a man much loved for this fullness of heart and kindly thought for those is sorrow or affliction. To but few in this life is it decreed to win the high esteem and love in which Father Deckenbrock was held by all who knew him; and with his taking away the Church looses one of her most influential and valued sons.Father Deckenbrock was born in Everswinkel, Westphalia, Germany, May 5th 1848, where he grew to manhood and was ordained as priest, coming to the United States shortly thereafter, and was stationed at Erie, and later at Meadville, Pa.
