SEEING THINGS ARIGHT

Within the past year or two, there has been a great heralding in the papers and magazines throughout the country about “prison reform’’ and the ‘‘regeneration’’ of men doing time in penal institutions, all of which has had a strong tendency to create an impression in the mind of the general public that prison inmates were being coddled, and were receiving better attention than other unfortunates not in penal institutions. The actual facts of the situation do not bear out any such a state of unalloyed happiness or extreme good fortune to the prisoner as has been depicted by the word-painters. That there has been some minor improvements in housing conditions and in the abatement of corporal punishment, can not be denied, but that prison inmates mn general are enjoying unlimited opportunity for recreation, is, to say the least, decidedly too absurd and ludicrous to be entertained for a moment in the mind of any one familiar with the true aspect of prison affairs. To shake hands with a prison official and pass through the corridors of a penal institution under the guidance of a loquacious guard, who seldom fails to extol the generous (?) privileges accorded inmates, and expect to be accurately informed on prison conditions, is about as near the point as it would be to walk through a college building and to come away with the thought of possessing a college degree.

Just what spirit may actuate the writers of such exaggerated ‘‘stuff’’ as appears in print from time to time, we do not know, nor is it relevant, but the point we do wish to impress on those interested in "the prison problem’’ and the uplift of prison inmates, is, that the circulation of such misleading and erroneous reports hasg a decidedly bad effect on genuine reform and a strong tendency to prejudice the public against immediate and sane advancement in the right direction.

It is our earnest hope that the writers and others who are prone to enlarge upon and paint such roseate views about prison reform and prison conditions in lengthy articles for public circulation, may be induced to stick a little closer to actual facts in future attempts at depicting prison conditions.
