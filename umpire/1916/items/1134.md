STAR NEIGHBORS Mr. C. E. Housden, an English hydraulic engineer, published a few years ago a somewhat startling book on Mars, in which he furnished detailed information in regard to the system of pipes and pumping stations whereby (in his opinion) the Martians are enabled to irrigate their arid planet. He has now produced a little brochure, entitled "Is Venus Inhabited?" in which similar engineering achievements are attributed to the problematical inhabitants of Venus. Mr. Housden sets out from the opinion of Sthiapa elli and Lowell, that Venus always turns the same face to the sun. Admitting the presence of water, this would result in one half of the planet's surface being permanently locked in ice, while on the other excessively hot and arid conditions would prevail. The writer assumes the habitable portion of the planet to be a zone of the sunlit hemisphere bordering the ice fields of the dark hemisphere. Melting glaciers from this ice would supply, water, which to prevent evaporation, the Venusians would convey in pipes rather than open channels to the places where they desired to use it. The book contains an extensive discussion of Venusian meteorology, and is plausible enough to be interesting.
