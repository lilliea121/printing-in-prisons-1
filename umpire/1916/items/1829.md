WORRY A POISON

Worry, like all other depressing emotions, is a poison. It is a short circuit that burns out the mental batteries and destroys the power for useful activity.

It is not merely a habit—it is a real disease. It is not merely the surrender of the will to morbid fancies or imaginary cause of anxiety —it is an actual disease, a real physical state, as real as is indigestion, rheumatism or any other bodily disease.

Within the last few years the emotions and their influence upon the body have been made the subject of laboratory study, and numerous highly interesting, important and practical facts have been developed. It is true that the question, “What is emotion?’’ still remains unsolved, as does the greater and noble question, What is the mind?”’ But the influence of the various emotions upon the body is now fairly well understood and can be described in definite physiological terms and thus made the subject of rational consideration.

The emotions are perhaps among the most powerful of all the influences which affect the body, and their specific effects present as definite, as clearly defined characteristics as do the effects produced by heat, cold, electricity and other physical agents or such bodily states as hunger, thirst and fatigue.
