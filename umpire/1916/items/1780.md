IN A RUT 
Edgar A. Guest

Same faces every day I see, 
The same old task to do,
I know tomorrow’s going to be 
The yesterday I knew.
Though other fellows higher climb 
And prosper, I remain
A settled fixture all the time 
And not a mile I gain.

Sometimes I feel that I am tied 
And bound by circumstance,
That in a field of labor wide 
I’ve never had a chance.
Only the narrow roads of life 
My feet have ever trod;
Without a thrill I face the strife, 
A soulless human clod.

And long ago I ceased to dream 
Of splendors that might be, 
My eyes gave up the glorious gleam 
Of future victory. 
I used to wonder now and then 
What time might have in store 
For me and my fellow-men, 
But I do that no more.

Each day is like its yesterday, 
Each year a year of grind;
Along my narrow, dreary way 
There’s nothing new to find.
I see my neighbors proudly claim 
New pleasures as theyv go,
But all my joys remain the same 
And not a thrill I know.

Do such thoughts ever come to you? 
Do you rebel at night
Against the tasks you have to do, 
And dread the morning light?
Then rouse yourself and break away, 
No door to you is shut,
Your trouble is that day by day 
You're sticking in a rut.
