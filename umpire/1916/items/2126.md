MEXICO AND ENGLAND AT ODDS

Commenting on the Mexican situation, the Toledo Blade remarks that it will be interesting to watch the controversy developing between England and Mexico. It hasnot been the English custom to admit that any nation with which Britain may have a dispute might be in the right. As a rule, politeness is not wasted on a smaller or weaker people. In this affair, it seems to us that consistency compels this Government to stand on the side lines. Having let Mexico know thatitcan go as far as it likes in slitting American throats, the Administration can not possibly inform Great Britain that we will go to war if British warships proceed to blow a few Mexican ports into kingdom come.
