“THIRD DEGREE" METHODS

Following our editorial of an earlier date, “A Near Victim of the Law,” a local paper has taken up the subject of ‘‘third degree’’ methods, in which the writer declares that where these methods are employed with sus- pected criminals, they are frequently open to the gravest abuse, and the pressure brought to bear on the accused is of such a nature as to be wholly contrary to the spirit of law and fair play.

The writer goes on to say it is one of the first principles of law that no one is ‘‘obliged to incriminate himself, and the officers of the law are supposed to warn an arrested person that any statement he makes is liable to be used against him. To attempt to terrorize him, in the absence of counsel to protect his rights, into damaging admissions or confessions is a plain contravention of this principle. It is true that the police may often justly exercise extra-legal powers in the interest of the public welfare. But this liberty is also a responsibility. It should be employed only with a full appreciation of the fact that, except where the evidence is incontestable, the presumption is of innocence, not of guilt. The circumstance that the suspected person is of known bad character should not deprive him of every legitimate legal safeguard. In such a case the ‘third degree’ might be justified by the results. But it is none the less a dangerous power to intrust to any body of men.

“This process of unnerving a prisoner by an appeal to his imagination or his conscience, his ignorance or his fear, is in essence a survival of medieval methods of torture which modern jurisprudence has happily abandoned. These methods existed to some extent even in countries like England, where trial by jury had become an established right. They suceeded the old ordeal and trial by battle, and were accepted as a quast judicium Dei. Confession was the best of all evidence, it was held, though the witchcraft trials refuted this assumption. Even Aristotle imputed to it ‘absolute credibility.' The third degree dces not inflict physical pain or bind its victims to the wheel. But the moral question involved is much the same. The invasion of the rights of the individual differs in degree rather than in kind. Furthermore, no body of men, even the sworn officers of the law, can be trusted with extra-legal powers and not be tempted to abuse them. Where such authority is desirable it should be exercised with due restraint. It is at best an expedient, and it is not in itself a substitute for law.

“These are very obvious considerations, though they are constantly being disregarded by the police. It is important both to punish and to prevent crime. But that is no reason why strong-arm practises should take the place of intelligent investigation. It should not be forgotten that to impress offenders of the law with the belief that they cannot expect justice, that they have no rights which society is bound to respect, that any means will justify the end of punishing them, is to make them more than ever a menace to society. That is a truth which is too often ignored, whether in vice raids or in arrests for more or less serious crimes. The police sometimes seem to think it enough to follow the Dogberry precedent and comprehend all vagrom men, in the hope of discovering among them by brutal terrorizing the real object of their search.’’
