Half the clouds that darken our minds and moods are due to thinking of the faults, failings and weakness of others. A peculiar irritability is thus developed which prevents any possibility of happiness or mental clearness. Call up in thought the men you know. Do the best, or the worst and weakest qualities of each come first in view? Are you friendly, or harsh and critical? No man ever gets peace whose mental keynote in criticsm. No man grow great qualities in himself while he pounders small ones in others. Our thoughts of others may be said to be the soil in which our own characters, small or great, grow.
