UNDERSTANDINGBy Rose De Vaux-Royer"He that hath ears to hear, let him hear."Have pity, Thou, for the unseeing eye;â€”For him who, seeing, understandeth not. Oh, raise their insight to the perfect skyOf promised vision by the earth-bound sought!Restore the sound attuned beyond the sense; Re-string the hearing to Truth's highest tone:Unto the failing give Thou recompenseFor prayers unspoken, mighty deeds undone.Oh, lend compassion to the fettered mind, Grouping the falt'ring of Lifes winding way,That thro' the sin-mist these at length may findThe path that leads unto the Perfect Day.
