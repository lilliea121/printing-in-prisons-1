DO SOMETHING FOR SOMEBODY

Do something for somebody somewhere— 
While jogging along life’s road;
Help some one to carry his burden 
And lighter will grow your load.

Do something for somebody gladly— 
Twill sweeten your every care; 
In sharing the sorrow of others 
Your own are less hard to bear.

Do something for somebody striving— 
To help where the way seems long 
And the homeless hearts that languish—
Cheer up with a little song.

Do something for somebody always 
Whatever may be your creed— 
There’s nothing on earth can help you 
So much as a kindly deed.
