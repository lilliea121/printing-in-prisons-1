Seek Record by Trip Around Globe

The motor-ship Siam will sail from Point Breeze for Japan via the Panama Canal on a voyage around the world during which she will not stop for fuel. The Siam left Copenhagen last July for Philadelphia with her blast tanks full of oil, under charter to load 240,000 cases of refined petroleum for Kobe, Japan.

The vesselâ€™s average speed is 12 knots. From Kobe she will go to Vladivostok to load beans for Denmark.

Captain Hansen, who is in command, anticipates no difficulty in making the entire trip on the oil he will leave here with today.
