KEEP A-GOIN'! If you strike a thorn or rose, Keep agoin'! If it hails or if it snows, Keep a-goin'! 'Tain't no use to sit and whine When the fish ain't on your line; Bait your hook and keep on tryin' —— Keep a-goin'! When the weather kills your crop, Keep a-goin'! When you tumble from the top, Keep a-goin'! S'pose you're out of every dime? Gettin' broke ain't any crime! Tell the world you're feelin' fine —— Keep a-goin'! When it looks like all is up, Keep a-goin'! Drain the sweetness from the cup, Keep a goin'! See the wild birds on the wing! Hear the bells that sweetly ring! When you feel like singin'—sing —— Keep a-goin'! — Selected
