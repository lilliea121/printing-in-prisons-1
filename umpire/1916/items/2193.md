A Mean Imposition

Our attention has been called to the fact that a member of the H. F. C impersonated the editor of THE UMPIRE to a lady visitor at the entertainment on Saturday last. In so far as receving any attendant credit is concerned there is little objection on our part; but we do object most emphatically to any lying cheat palming himself off on an innocent visitor for the purpose of securing correspondence and other considerations at our expense and possible discredit.

If this offense is continued or repeated the culprit’s number will be published and he will suffer the consequences. —Editor.
