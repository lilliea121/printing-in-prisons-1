VOLCANO ACTIVE AGAIN

A report from Redding, Cal., announces that Lassen Peak began belching black balls of smoke at intervals of five to ten minutes. Those who have watched the mountain since it awoke out of a fifty-year torpor in May, 1914, expressed the opinion that the Peakâ€™s crater is a bubbling cauldron of lava.

The most violent eruption of the year took place Saturday afternoon, according to accounts from observers present at the Peak at that time.
