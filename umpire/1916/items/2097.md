THE FIRST TEST

Apparently the first test of the validity of the so-called eight-hour law is to come through the suit begun in the Federal Court at Omaha by the Union Pacific Railroad, says the Rochester Post-Dispatch.

“The company says that the law is unconstitutional because it is not a proper regulation of inter-state commerce and because it violates the amendment to the Constitution of the United States which provides that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation. Another complaint is that the law is unworkable under the present system of train operation. The sooner the questions at issue are settled the better”
