"BREAKING IN" PIPES While it is true that a pipe smoker works up an affection for a pipe which he made use of for a long time, it is likewise true that he would discard the old one sooner if it were not for the somewhat objectionable operation of "breaking in'? a new one. It requires many days of use before the bowl of a new pipe has acquired a crust on the inner surface, which seems to be essential for the full enjoyment of the smoke. It is now proposed to sell the pipe already "broken in," this task being performed by an electrical carbonizer which has just been patented. It consists of a heating element introduced into the bowl of the pipe and sealed in such a manner that an intense heat is applied to the inside of the bowl, after which it is ready to be placed into the hands of the smoker and put into active service by him at once.
