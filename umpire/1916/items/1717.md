REMAINS OF HORNED GIANTS FOUND IN INDIAN MOUND

Mound Uncovered Said to be Over 900 Years Oldâ€”Find of Great Scientific Importance

It is reported from Binghamton, N. Y , that a party composed of Professor A. B. Skinner, of the American Indian Museum; Prof. W. K. Morehead, of Phillips Andover Academy, and Dr. George Donohue, Pennsylvania State hist- orian, who have been conducting a research along the valley of the Susquehanna, have un- covered an Indian mound at Tioga point, on the upper portion of Queen Esther's flats, on the Murray farm, a short distance from Sayre, N. Y. In the mound were found the bones of 68 men which are believed to have been buried over 900 years ago.

The average height of these men, when the skeletons were assembled, was 'seven feet, while many were much taller. Further evidence of their gigantic size was found in large stone axes in the grave. On some of the skulls two inches above the perfectly formed forehead, were protuberances of bone evidently horns that had been there since birth.

Members of the expedition say that it is the first discovery of its kind on record. The skull and a few bones found in one grave were shipped to the American Indian Museum.
