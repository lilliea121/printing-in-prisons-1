Commenting on the conditions which are to be found in many of the penal institutions throughout the country the—Moniter says:—

““Keeping men in idleness in prison, as a means of doing justice, protecting property and accomplishing the other things aimed at under the name of correction, is, rather giadually, being found not only costly to the public, but to place penalties upon the wrong persons. Studies need not advance far to reveal that it is actually the family, rather than the incar- cerated man, that is sentenced. An inquiry, by the Chicago Juvenile Protective Association, as to the experience of families of men sent to a house of correction, shows that in nearly every instance the wife and the children are compelled to do unaccustomed work, or are aided by charity. In only three out of fifty cases did they possess property sufﬁcient for support. At least a share of his earnings at some useful trade is plainly enough the due of the prisoner and his dependents, but that phase of both economic and personal justice is scantily recognized in the present systems.
