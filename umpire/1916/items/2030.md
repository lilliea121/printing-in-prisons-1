It does not matter how many tumbles you have in this life, so long as you do not get dirty when you tumble. There is the greatest practical benefit in making a few failures in life. You learn that which is of inestimable importanceâ€”that there are a great many people in the world who are as clever as you are and you very soon find out if you have not found it out before, that patience and tenacity of purpose are worth more than twice their weight in cleverness.
