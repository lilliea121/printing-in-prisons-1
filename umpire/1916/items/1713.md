GIVE THE FLOWERS NOW

Closed eyes can’t see the while roses,
Closed hands can’t hold them, you know; 
Breath that is still cannot gather
The odors that sweet from them blow, 
Death, with a peace beyond dreaming,
Its children of Earth does endow; 
Life is the time we can help them,
So give the flowers now.
Here are the struggles and striving; 
Here are the care and the tears; 
Now is the time to be soothing 
The frowns and the furrows and fears. 
What to closed ears are kind sayings? 
What to hushed heart is deep vow? 
Naught can avail after parting, 
So give the flowers now. 
Just a kind word or a greeting, 
Just a warm hand grasp or a smile— 
These are the flowers that will lighten 
The burdens of many a mile. 
After the journey is over, 
What is the use of them, how 
Can they carry, whao must be carried? 
Oh, give the flowers now.
Blooms from the happy heart’s garden, 
Plucked in the spirit of love; 
Blooms that are earthly reflections 
Of flowers that blossom above. 
Words cannot tell what a measure 
Of blessing such gifts will allow 
To dwell in the lives of the many, 
So give the flowers now.
