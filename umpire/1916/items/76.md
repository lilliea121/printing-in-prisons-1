H. & F. CLUB NOTES

The entertainment of last Saturday was a
huge success, and judging from the applause
given, jt was very much appreciated by the
boys.

We have other good actsto put on later,
with plenty of music, and songs; but we would
like to hear from any member who may be able
to do a trick, sing a song, or play an instru
ment, as we want all the performers we can
get to help keep the ball a rolling, so if any-
one can do a good stunt, send your number in
to and the entertainment committece will
call on vou; they can help you to perfect your
act.

We have other surprises, in the way of 1ead-
ing matter etc., which will be fully expl. incd
later. All this will depend on the membcrs,
and we expect their full support and help to
accomplish these things.

This week the 5th Block and gallery go out,
tickets will be issued on Saturday. at noon.
