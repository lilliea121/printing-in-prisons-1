COME UP HIGHER By James G. Clark I saw the mountains stand Silent, wonderful, a d grand, Looking out across the land When the golden light was falling On distant dome and spire; And heard a low voice calling "Come up higher, come up higher From the lowland and the mire, From the mist of earth desire, From the vain pursuit of pelf, From the attitude of self: Come up higher, come up higher."
