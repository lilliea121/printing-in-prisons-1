INVERTED VALUES Professor Fisher of Yale, says a baby is worth $90; a grown person $4,000. I always knew that money talks, But now I know it hollers; Oh husaby, oh lullaby, My little ninety dollars! They say that riches all take wings, My trepidation follers; Oh husaby, oh lullaby, My little ninety dollars! The moon looks down the livelong night And shines upon the cholera, Amused to see four thousand plunks Walk ninety little dollars. New York Sun.
