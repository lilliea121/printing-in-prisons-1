It is said that Americans who have enlisted in the British army for service in Europe are to be denied the use of the name "American legion," according to orders of the Canadian Government authorities. These swagger Americans will not be permitted to diplay the title on their uniforms or on any other part of their equipment. This is as it should be, and we are pleased at the action taken by the Canadian authorities, which was induced by a request made by officials of the United States Government.
