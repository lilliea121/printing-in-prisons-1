THE FRAME-UP OF OSBORNE

An eastern paper in commenting editorily on
the frame-up of Thomas Mott Osborne, has
very aptly expressed its opinion as follows:
Warden Osborne may have been a failure asthe
head of the New York State prison at Sing
Sing. The general public certainly does not
think ‘so, but it sometimes happens that
the public does not size up a man correctly for
a time, although in the long run its judgments
are pretty sound and sane However, it may
be that Osborne was a misfit at Sing Sing. But
it will probably take more than the present
“frame-up’’ in New York to convince the
public that it is wrong. The trouble with the
so-called ‘‘investigation’’ of Osborne is that
everybody could see, from the start, that the
investigators were out ‘get’’ the warden of
Sing Sing. The*‘frame-up’’ was too plain for
the public to make much mistake about it.
No matter what the testimony, the investiga-
tors wanted to twist it to something to the
warden’s discredit. Whitman needed some
sort of an excuse before he was willing to dis-
miss the warden. He wanted to please the
politicians, but he did not care to make too
bare-faced a job of Usborne’s political excution,
So the ‘‘investigation’’ furnished the excuse
