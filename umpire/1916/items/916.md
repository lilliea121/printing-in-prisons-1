BREAD CAST UPON THE WATERS "The esteem of one's fellow men is a thing everyone wants. And this, too, is marked with a price in plain figures. It is indicated in the maxim: He who would have friends must show himself friendly. To make others love you there is no. other. recipe than for you to love them. ; You get from the world just about the love and goodwill you put into it. It is easy to criticize and to see unlovable qualities in folks. Give yourself up to this tendency and you discover sooner or later that men regard you, too, with an unnamable eye. But encourage good and kindly judgments, look for the admirable qualities in all you meet, be loyal and loving yourself and this bread you have cast upon the waters shall surely return to you."
