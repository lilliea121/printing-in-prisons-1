P. R. R. HAS LARGEST "ELECTRIC LOCOMOTIVE

The Altoona correspondent of a local paper tells of another mechanical marvel that is soon to be put in operation on the Pennsyl- vania Railroad. After three months work employes of the Pennylvania Railroadâ€™s Juniata shops have completed what is said to be the largest electric locomotive in the country. It is eighty feet long and really two locomotives in one. It has a hauling capacity equal to three steam engines of the L-I-S type in use on the Pittsburg division and will obtain its power from an overhead wire system. Later it will be sent to the Westinghouse plant at Pittsburg to be equipped with motors. After thatit goes to the Norfolk and Western road, which is partly electrified, for an extended test.
