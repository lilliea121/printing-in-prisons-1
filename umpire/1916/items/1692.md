Episcopal Services at the Chapel

The regular monthly Episcopal services were held at the E. S. P. Chapel on Thursday morn- ing last, in charge of the Rev. Thomas J. Taylor.

Notwithstanding the heat of the day, there was a good attendance of the inmate members of the church present. The music and singing was highly satisfactory from a musical stand- point, which speaks well for those in charge.

Confirmation class was conducted by the Rev. Charles E. Taylor, son of the Rev. T. J. Taylor, in the afternoon, at which time he ad- dressed the class on the subject of “‘Will Power.”” The discourse was very interesting and we hope for another visit from him in the near future.
