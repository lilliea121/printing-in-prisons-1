TREMENDOUS COSTS OF THE GREAT WAR

Has Already Cost Over $75,000,000,000 and End Not in Sight

The indebtedness of the seven principal nations engaged in the European war has crossed $75,000,000,000, according to statistics prepared by the Mechanics and Metals National Bank, of New York, and made public in a special report on the fiancial aspects of the war. In the middle of 1914 the indebtedress of these seven nations was $27,000,000,000.

Financing on an extensive scale has taken place abroad this fall. France has issued a second formal war loan, Germany a fifth loan, and Russia a sixth loan. Great Britain has issued temporary securities in encrmous sums.

The war is now costing $105,000,000 every twenty-four hours, according to the bankâ€™s statement, expenditures of the Entente Allies being fully double those of the Central Allies.

Last April, when this bank undertook previously to make a fiancial analysis of the war, its calculation of daily war cost was $99,000,000. 

That Europe will have expended $75,000,000,000 directly for military operations, and that its combined direct and indirect cost will have been above $100,000,000,000 if hostilities extend to the middle of next year, is the statement made by the bank.
