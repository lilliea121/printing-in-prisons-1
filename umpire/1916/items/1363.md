36,000 EMPLOYES TO GET WAGES INCREASED In a report from South Bethlehem, it is learned that twenty-four thousand employes on the payroll of the Bethlehem Steel Company, were made glad lately by the announcement of a voluntary increase in wages of 10 per cent., which will become effective on May 1. The increase will mean the adding of $170,000 per month to the payroll, which last month was $1,700,000. This is a third voluntary increase, each approximating 10 percent. raise in less than a year. The increase also affects the 7000 employes of the Pennsylvania Steel Company, at Steelton, Pa., and 5000 at the Maryland Steel Company's plant at Sparrows Point, near Baltimore, where there is also a shipyard. These two companies were recently purchased by Mr. Schwab.
