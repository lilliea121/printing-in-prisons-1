ALL THE "TRUSTIES" RETURN Over One Thousand Prisoners In North Carolina Lived Up To Their Parole All the prisoners released on parole for the holidays, faithfully kept their promise and returned to the 10 State penitentiary camps and 100 county road building forces; reporting promptly to the wardens and overseers, thus proving themselves worthy of the trust imposed in them by Governor Craig of North Carolina. The officers express great satisfaction in their report to Governor Craig, at the fact that-every prisoner had returned to work. All not allowed the liberty of going home were cheered by their holiday and the happiness of their fellow inmates. Governor Craig's order effected more than 1000, but only two slight misdemeanors are reported. These occurred in Governor Craig's hometown, Ashville, when two liberated men got drunk. They returned to camp punctually. The Governor is reported as being highly pleased with his experiment, and says "he will give other privileges to the prisoners as they prove themselves worthy of trust."
