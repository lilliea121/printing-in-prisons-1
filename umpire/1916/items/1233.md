A PUZZLING ADDRESS One of our esteemed contemporaries whose editor is noted for his acute perception in many puzzling affairs, tells of a letter which got into the mails bearing this address: wood/mass There was nothing more to indicate for whom the letter was intended or the name of his post-office and state. Many postal clerks vainly tried to decipher it, and it finally found its way to the dead-letter office at Washington, where a clerk made out the name, town and state. We promised to explain the puzzle. Here is all there is to the address: "Mark Underwood, Andover, Mass." It is perfectly obvious that there is a mark under "Wood," and over "Mass." Easy, isn't it?
