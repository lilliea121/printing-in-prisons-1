One of the characteristics of modern industry is the utilization of wastes that were formerly thrown away. One of the newer and more surprising illustrations of this is the utilization of the glass dust which accumulates in the factories. This is now melted and molded into blocks, which form an extremely efficient and useful material for paving streets.
