MILE LONG TRAIN OF GOLD IN U. S. TREASURY

A Washington corespondent avers that Uncle Samâ€™s pocketbook never before contained somuch as at the present moment. Two billions of dollars of gold reserve is the record reached by the United States Treasury on Monday, according to a statement issued by the officials yesterday. This far exceeds any amount ever previously corralledin any treasury of any nation at any time.

Experts show that the present gold reserve would weigh 3,668.2 tons, on the basis of a weight 3.68 pounds for each $1000. This would load 138 cars with the weight of $15,000,000 in gold to the car or about 55,000 pounds to the car. The total number of cars, allowing forty feet to each car, would be consider- ably over a mile in length.
