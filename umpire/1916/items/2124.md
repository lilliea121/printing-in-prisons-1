THANKSGINING DAY 
By John Kendrick Bangs

For all the gracious gifts in harvest fair
In things material, whose goodly share I richly prize;
For man’s abundant wealth that lies in sight,
And for the sense of power and of might
With which to meet a foe, and fight the fight, my thanks arise.
But for the richer gift of Love and Peace
That bring the soul a sense of sweet release From pressing care;
For mercy shown; for greater growth of soul;
For light when clouds of deadly dark uproll
To point the way to some more lofty goal, 
And leads us there;
For broader human sympathy, for tears 
Of Brotherhood to ease another’s fears, 
And cheer his way; 
For seeing eyes, and shoulders fit to bear 
The burdens of our fellows in despair, 
And right good-will to help them in their care 
When times are gray; 
For men of hearts and soul inclined 
To honor of a lowlier, meeker kind, 
With grace endued; 
Who seek all dire injustices to mend, 
To guide the hopeless to some hopeful end— 
Not this alone, but all my days I spend 
In gratitude!
