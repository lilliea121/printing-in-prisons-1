RING IN THE TRUE 
By Mabel Lockman

“Ring out the old, ring in the new!” 
Thus England’s laureate, years agone, 
Did prophesy a golden dawn,
The coming triumph of the true.

The doom of dogma, error fraught, 
The end of fear’s old-world demain, 
To usher in the glorious reign
Of peace so long, so vainly sought.

“Ring out the false, ring in the true!”
Pass! false conception of a God 
With wrathful heart and vengeful rod! 
Too long this old distorted view

Has robbed man of his birthright trust, 
Implanted fear and doubt—not love 
For Him, in whom we live and move,
Has kept him grovelling in the dust.

“Ring out a slowly dying cause,’’ 
Let strife give way to brotherhood 
And rivalry to common good,
And greed and crime, to purer laws.

“Ring in the Christ that is to be!”
Oh! even now in every heart
Is born the Christ, man’s nobler part, 
Imparting truth that makes him free.
