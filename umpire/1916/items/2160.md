EXPLORER TELLS OF GOLD SPEARS AND BULLETS
Eskimos Have Mountain of Precious Metal—Ignorant of Its Value

Returning from the Far North and bringing a tale of the land where gold is more plentiful than in Alaska, Christen Leden, a young Swedish explorer, has just arrived in New York City, after three years in the Arctic. He brought with him a harpoon head hammered out of gold by the natives of a camp since wiped out by disease. He also has several specimens of gold-bearing quartz brought to him by Eskimos. Leden said he had visited a land where the ground was so full of oil that in the warm months the smell of it filled the air.

Just where the gold and oil are Mr. Leden, who is now at the Waldorf-Astoria, will not say. The place where the gold is to be found he did not visit, because to have done so, he said, would have meant another two years in the Far North. Eskimos told him of a great hill that had been so split that the different strata were uncovered. Here the reddish-yellow metal could be seen. He adds:

“One very old man told how his grand-father, the possessor of an old-fashioned big-bore gun, had found a yellow metal that he had hammered out to make bullets. The natives, of course, have no idea of its value.”
