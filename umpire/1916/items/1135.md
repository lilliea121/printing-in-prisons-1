"RICOCHET BULLETS. According to a writer in the February "Popular Science Monthly, and World's Advance," most of the reports concerning the use of dumdum bullets in the world war have been unauthentic. He says: "It is now thought that the charges on each side that dum-dum bullets were being used were caused by the peculiar effect of what has come, to be known as a ‘ricochet' bullet. This is a bullet which has struck a very, hard substance with such force that it burst its jacket and then rebounded and hit a soldier. The X-ray has revealed many ‘ricochet' bullets. They make a large wound, much lacerated and bruised."
