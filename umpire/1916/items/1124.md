FASTEST U.S. VESSEL A TORPEDOBOAT CHASER A late report from Washington, states that a vessel designed to be the fastest boat in the United States Navy, is being built by the Green Port Basin and Construction Company at Green Port, L. I. The craft, a torpedoboat chaser, will have a speed of 41 miles an hour. Equipment with double rudders will make â€˜it possible to turn the boat in its own length. It will carry one-pound rapid-fire guns and a 16 inch torpedo tube. Drawing only 2 feet 10 inches of water, the craft will be able to skim over mines. Twenty boats of similar construction were recently completed for the Russian Government by the same company.
