NEW SOUTH AMERICAN STEAM- SHIP LINE TO START OCT. 15

A local paper makes the anncuncement that arrangements for the first sailing on the new Philadelphia-South American Line between Philadelphia and Rio Janeiro were made at the headquarters of the Chamber of Commerce Friday by Herman L. Wright, of New York, president of theline. The first vessel willleave Philadelphia October 15.

The organization of this new company, which is capitalized at $1,000,000, is the re- sult of a campaign carried on by the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce for a line between this city and South America. The need of such a line has long been felt by the business interests of this community, and it is believed that the service will mark a new era in the maritime history of Philadelphia.

Temporary offices have been furnished the new line in the Foreign Trade Bureau of the Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce until per- manent headquarters can be obtained. The Philadelphia terminal of the lines will be the Pennsylvania Railroad piers.
