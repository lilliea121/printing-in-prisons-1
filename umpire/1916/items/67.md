Let us banish all vain regrets, lift up your
heads, and gird yourselves for braveand cheer-
ful toil. “In time the release will come; rest,
made sweet by toil; glory, that is bright after
the darkness is passed; and victory so complete,
that we shall not wish the conflicts to have
been less stern, or the perils of life’s highway
less numerous or compelling.”’
