FORGETTING AND REMEMBERING Let us forget the things that vexed and tried us, The worrying things that caused our soul to fret; The hopes that, cherished long, were still denied us, Let us forget. Let us forget the little slights that pained us, The greater wrongs that rankle sometimes yet; The pride with which some lofty one disdained us, Let us forget. Let us forget our brother's fault and failing, The yielding to temptations that beset, That he, perchance, though grief be unavailing, Cannot forget. But blessings manifold, past all deserving, Kind words and helpful deeds, a countless throng, The fault o'ercome, the rectitude unswerving, Let us remember long. The sacrifice of love, the generous giving, When friends were few, the handclasp warm and strong, The fragrance of each life of holy living, Let us remember long. Whatever things are good and true and gracious, What'er of has triumphed over wrong, What love of God or man has rendered precious, Let us remember long.
