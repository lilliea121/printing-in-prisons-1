THE DRUIDS

The Druids were evidently of very great antiquity, for there can not be much doubt that it was one of their customs that Virgil had in mind when he wrote in the "Aeneid," vi, 142, that the ‘‘only means of access for a living mortal to the world of spirits was the carrying of a golden twig which grew in a dark and thick grove.’’ The resemblance of the story to the Druidical rite is perfect. Druids practised their rites in dark groves. If a mistletoe was discovered growing upon an oak a priest severed it with a knife, a festival was held under the tree at which two milk white bulls were offered as a sacrifice to the sun:god, and mistletoe, from its pale greenish yellow tint, was regarded as a kind of vegetable gold and accordingly looked upon as being a fit offering to the sun.
