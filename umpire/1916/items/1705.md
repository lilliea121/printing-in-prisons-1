The poem printed above is by Miss A. M. C. Dupree, and is sent to the ‘‘Umpire’’ as her “message to all of the ‘boys’ from their faith- ful friend, and ‘The Goal’ is theirs I know.”’

Because of her absence thru long-continued illness many of our men have only a little knowledge of Miss Dupree. All the acts of kindness and attention practiced by the King’s Daughters in here, are due more to her thirty years of influence as an organizing spirit than to any one. The hundreds of potted plants and holiday cards given out at Easter, Thanks- giving and Christmas, originated with her. Her determination to be a help to the inmates was always strong despite the hard conditions for Christian Visitors and the close discipline over the prizoners a generation ago. Like all true workers for the uplift of others, she never seeks publicity, which is the strongest evidence of sincerity.
