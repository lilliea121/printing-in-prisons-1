TURNING SAWDUST TO ACCOUNT

It is a fact known to few that more than 20,000 tons of wood flour, valued at $300,000, are used annually in the United States in two widely different industries, the manufacture of dynamite and the manufacture of inlaid linoleum.

Wood flour is also used in making composition flooring, oatmeal paper, and in several other industries. It forms one of the means by which the huge waste product of our lumber mills is beginning to find some better means of disposal than the burner. Since a total of 36,000,000 cords of such waste is produced each year at saw-mills in the United States, of which about one-half goes into the furnaces as fuel, while the rest is burned as refuse to dispose of it, there is no lack of raw material for industries which can develop ways of turning this waste to account.
