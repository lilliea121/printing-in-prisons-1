SEA POWER PARADOX Writing in "Land and Water," A. H. Pollen states that it is one of the paradoxes of the present war that the possession of an invincible navy, instead of freeing Great Britain from military obligations, has placed them upon her shoulders. He points out that so absolutely has the enemy accepted the British sea supremacy, that she has lost both the advantages and disadvantages of her insular position. â€˜So far," says he, "from our great fleet having relieved us of the duty of maintaining an army proportionate in strength to itself, it is precisely the fleet and nothing else which, by enabling Great Britain to use Such a force, has imposed upon her the burden of creating it."
