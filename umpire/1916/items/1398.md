ARE YOU THE CHAP? by E. A. Brininstool. Someone's always feeling blue. Are you the chap? Someone don't know what to do. Are you the chap? Someone sees disaster pending: Someone's trials are extending; Someone's woes are never-ending. Are you the chap? Someone's always out of luck. Are you the chap? Someone lacks backbone and pluck. Are you the chap? Someone always is repining; Someone all the time is whining; Someone sees no bright sun shining. Are you the chap? Someone never gives a smile. Are you the chap? Someone's grouchy all the while. Are you the chap? Someone's always cross and sour; Someone's grumpy every hour; Someone doubts God's saving power. Are you the chap? Someone laughs the whole day long. Are you the chap? Someone's lips are wreathed in song. Are you the chap? Someone's heart binds ours the tighter; Someone makes our burdens lighter. Someone makes this old world brighter. Are you the chap?
