WILL NOT BE DEBARRED No doubt it will be a source of assurance for some of our readers to learn that ex-prisoners are not to be debarred from taking United States civil service examinations in the future because of having been convicted of a crime. The New Era goes on to say that "if a former prisoner applies for permission to take an examination for the federal service his application is weighed on its merits. These facts, establishing hope for ambitious men who have fallen into the hand of the law, are embodied in a statement by the United States Civil Service Commission, made public recently by Postmaster Weaver on behalf of a prisoner in the McAlester Penitentiary. This prisoner was formerly a man high in the affairs of Oklahoma. He had the confidence of the biggest men of the State and was regarded as one of the coming young men; but one day temptation came to him, he committed forgery and was sent to prison. Now his term has nearly expired and he wishes to know whether or not a man with the stigma of prison on his name will be permitted by the government to take civil service examinations.
