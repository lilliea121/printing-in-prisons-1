HOME IS:Where you wish you were about twenty times a day when you are away from it. Where you got three square meales adayâ€” and didn't appreciate them.Where you can step across the hall wearing a Turkish towel and a cake of soap without fear of seven or eight people seeing you.Where you don't have to dress for dinner.Where you don't have to tip someone every two hours. Where the view isn't much but the food and beds and company and general environments have got it all over any other spot on the map.Where you go when all the other places are closed.
