SAGE LEAVES

If you could only impress some fellows of the necessity of making a good start, there would be no need of catching up.

A petty official of a prison society advo- cates the abolition of tobacco among prisoners. Strange how narrow some men do become. A little alum, please.

How nice it would be if our friends in the outer world would only keep their promises
We know of several nien who have become melancholy through broken promises.

â€” The Ranger.
