AMERICAN CITIZENS

In practise there is no such thing as "a citizen of the United States.” Such “citizen" is about as mythical as the mermaid. In order to vote, for instance, one must bring his citizenship down to the concrete and become a citizen of New York, or of some one of the other states. You can not vote in New York unless you are a citizen of New York; and the same is true of all the other states. The "citizen of the United States” is a very vague gentleman.
