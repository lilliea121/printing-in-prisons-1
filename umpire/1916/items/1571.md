It pays to show a manly spirit when the occasion arises. At last so it proved in the case of Frank Canning, of Clarksboro, N. J., who recently received a fortune of $200,000, left to him by a Detroit, Mich., woman who died some time ago. It appears that at some previous time the woman was visiting in the East and while riding in a street-car she was made the subject of a number of coarse jests by a crowd of loafers who were in the car. This proved too much for Canning's manhood to stand, so he sailed into the crowd and after throwing off two of their number, forced the others to desist. For that act he has just received a splendid reward.
