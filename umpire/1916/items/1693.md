On The Road to Baseball Fame

Information reaches us from Skowhegan, Me., that Bill McKe nty, son of Warden Robt. J. McKenty, has been doing things up in that country that has caused the l8cal fans to “sit up and take notice.”” “‘Bill’’ has won 9 straight games, losing none so far,—the one hundred per cent kind it seems,—which leads us to be- lieve that it just runs in the blood and so comes natural to make good.

Connie Mack believes that there is a fine baseball future in store for “Bill,”” which would indicate that there is a strong probability of his wearing the uniform of the Athletics before long.
