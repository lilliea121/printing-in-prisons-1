FAIRYLAND
To Algernon Blackwood

Whither lies the white road, the right road to
Fairyland?

We find no sign nor trace of it, and old we’ve
grown and gray.

Our eyes are dim with peering, and our quest-
ing feet are weary,

And there’s ne’er a soul to guide us with the
Wee Folk all away. :

Who can tell the dear way, the near way to
Fairyland,

Where none, they say, wax old or sad?
there that we would be.

How shall we believe that the sun and stars
will show it us.

Child and bird and field-flower and butterfly
and tree?

It’s

Who keeps the gold key, the old key of Fairy-

land?

Always and all ways we seek it near and
T, M

Whisht! foolish wanderers—turn, and ye shall
find it

In each heart where wonder and love and wor-
ship are.
