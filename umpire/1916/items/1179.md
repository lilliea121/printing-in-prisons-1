The President Wears Green Tie From a Washington report we are informed that President Wilson celebrated St. Patrick's Day by wearing a green necktie and a sprig of shamrock sent him by John Redmond, the Irish Nationalist leader in the British Parliament. Sprigs of green were worn generally by White House employes, members of the Cabinet, and other Government officials.
