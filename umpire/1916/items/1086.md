A German naval officer is authority for the statement that sixty submarines have been put in hand in German and Belgian yards since the outbreak of the war. Of these, twenty-four are of about 250 tons displacement, twelve of about 800 tons, and twenty-four of about 1200 tons. According to this authority, over one-half have been passed into service and this, at the time the statement was made, gives an average rate of completion of about two boats every three weeks. At the present rate of construction it would seem from these figures that the German statement for their putting out one boar a week, may be correct.
