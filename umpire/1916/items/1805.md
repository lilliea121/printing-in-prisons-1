WOULDN’T YOU THINK
Charlotte Perkins Gilman

Wouldn't you think if it is right to seize 
A man, and hide him in a pile of stone; 
Rob him of sunshine, starlight, grass and trees, 
Freedom and friendship; bottle him, alone, 
An Amputated Man—as where one sees 
A Finger in formaldehyde, to show 
The horrible result of some disease — 
Wouldn’t you think—if ‘tis right, you know- 
Society to take such vengence strong, 
Must blame and fear, in him some awful wrong?

Wouldn’t you think, if any little child, 
Born a pink baby, wholly innocent,
May grow up dissolute, fierce, tempered, wild
Of mischievous behavior and intent;
If, our infancy so undefield, 
May grow a criminal, of sins so great
As warrants cruelty or vengeance piled; 
Wouldn’t you think, if crime so hurts the State,
That State would guard the baby unafraid,
And see that no more criminals were made?

Wouidn’t you think, since prisons cost so dear; 
Since keeping prisoners all the guards degrade; 
Since men imprisoned leave all poorer here, 
For lack of each man’s service in his trade; 
Since prisoners’ families the wolf must fear, 
Or tax the State as our tax-payers know; 
Since long the lists of legal costs appear; 
Wouldn’t you think —if all these things are so— 

Society would find it less a curse 
To make men better than to make them worse?
