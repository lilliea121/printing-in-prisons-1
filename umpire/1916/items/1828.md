AROUND THE BEND

Around the bend there’s a lovelier view, 
And the road may wind sweeter than here; 
With meadows each side that shall glisten with dew, 
And birds that shall warble their cheer. 
There are mountains, perhaps, with their blue summits high 
In the mist and the glory of light, 
And a far-away place in the blue of the sky 
That shall comfort your heart for its night.

Around the world there’s a fairer land dear, 
Than the road has yet shown by the way; 
And the summits of glory may stand out so clear 
In that golden and wonderful day. 
The dust may be deeper above the sharp stones, 
And the grass may be greener, who knows 
And a wind that may sing for the wind that now moans, 
And instead of the thistle, the rose.

Around the bend there’s a valley, perhaps, 
Full of rest, and of blossoms, and dreams, 
Where the wave of the river of quietude laps, 
And the mossy banks slope to the streams. 
There are shelters, no doubt, from the storm and the strife, 
And dancing and music and cheer, 
And a turn for the better in everyone’s life— 
Let us follow, and feel no fear!
