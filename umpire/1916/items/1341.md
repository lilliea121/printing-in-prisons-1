PRISONERS MAKES ROADSBetween 50 and 60 per cent, of the able bodied prisoners committed to the state prison in Colorado, are now employed in building roads. The prisoners live in camps without guards, the honor system being depended upon to prevent desertions. One prison gang has just completed, after two years of blasting of solid granite an automobile highway from Kansas up the Arkansas River to its source, over the Continental Divide and to the Utah line. Another gang of men is building a road in Eagle River Canyon. In addition to the road work the prisoners are working three large ranches. In the last seven years, 1,000 miles of roadway have been constructed by Colorado prisoners.
