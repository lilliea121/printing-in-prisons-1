AN AERIAL AMBULANCE Inventive genius seems never to have been so prolific as at the present time. Among the many novelties announced as practical is an aerial ambulance, built by a California manufacturer, and army aviators at San Diego, Cal., have been permitted to see it. Under the body of the aeroplane is slung a small cot, which is so fastened and constructed that it will be impossible for the occupant to fall out or even be shaken when the aeroplane volplanes to earth. It is understood that while the craft is en route to the hospital a trained attendant will be enabled to give first aid to the patient.
