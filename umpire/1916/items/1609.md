E. S. P. BAND CONCERT ON THE CENTER The Fourth of July was appropriately observed at this institution by a well arranged program of musical selections, which was rendered by the E.S. P. band on the Center. The bandmen seemed imbued with the spirit of the day and did their best to fill the various corridors with harmonious strains, and succeeded to a marked degree. Professor A. F. Wiegandt clearly evinced his ability as a leader, by the fine work of the band in the rendition of the various selections which are given below:
