U. S. SAYS ALL SUBMARINES ARE NOT WARSHIPS

A Washington dispatch says that to the proposal of the Entente Allies that neutrals accept the principle that all submarines are vessels of war, the United States has dispatched a reply which, it is understood, holds that the characteristics of each submersible must govern the case.

Diplomats here announced that Norway, Sweden and Spain had forbidden their harbors to merchant submarines on the ground that they were ‘‘indistinguishable’’ from war craft.

The memorandum from the Allies was sent to all neutral Powers. The reply of the Uni- ted States, it was officially stated, was also in the form of a memorandum, and not a formal note.

To the contention in the Allies, memorandum that it is difficult, if not impossible, for warships to distinguish between armed and merchant submarines, the American reply is understood to point out that it is equally difficult to distinguish between sailing merchant vessels which may have masked batteries.
