TO BE A LINCOLN Edward E. Van Zile Who'd be a Lincoln must be great of soul, Calm, strong and patient, with a loving heart; With wide flown vision to embrace the whole; Not rest too long upon a petty part. A nation's leader, with a people rent In factions bitter and by hatred stirred, Can be like him, our martyred President, Only if deeds shall march behind his word. He waited, Lincoln, till the time was born When it was well that he should strike the blow; He faced contumely and he endured scorn, But neither went too fast nor went too slow Who'd be a Lincoln must both speak and act; His hand must do what tongue has left undone; A Lincoln with his soul must make a pact To gain from force what kindness has not won.
