SUN RIVALLED BY NEW LIGHT

It is reported from New York that with a brilliancy twenty-two times greater than that of the worldâ€™s most powerful lighthouse, at Sandy Hook, a searchlight is mounted on the roof of the Grand Central Palace to focus attention on the Electrical Exposition being held in the palace.

The new searchlight is the invention of Elmer A. Sperry. It is called a high-intensity searchlight and throws its brilliant beam of light a distance of fifty miles. In conjunction with officers of the Navy Department, Mr. Speiry is endeavoring to flash signals to the navy yard in Philadelphia.

So powerful are the rays of the new light that its brilliance equals that of the sun at 8 o'clock in the morning or at 4 in the afternoon at this season of the year.
