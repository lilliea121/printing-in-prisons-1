The Government employes at Washington, D. C., numbering over 30,000, are to get an increase in their pay. National Guardsmen are to receive $2,125,000; and the E. S. P. overseers are to receive the same rate of pay as in the past two years. Remember that a faint heart never won a full pocketbook. Make the start today for an increase. You fellows are dead slow. Do something. Do it now.
