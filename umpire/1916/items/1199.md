THE LATEST ZEPPELINSAccording to a recent press dispatch from Berne, Switzerland, there are some eighty Zeppelins in German service. This statement is said to be based on information developed at Friedrichshafen, where the airship works are located. Recently, one of latest type Zeppelins made a trial flight. It bore the number LZ-95, and its design varied considerably from the antebellum Zeppelins. Its gondolas are said to be plated steel. The craft is plentifully supplied with machine guns and apparatus for throwing bombs and aerial torpedoes; among the latter being a new type which is reported to be far more powerful than any heretofore developed.
