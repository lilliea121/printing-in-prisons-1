Notice of King’s Daughter’s Resignation

It will be a source of regret to the inmates of this institution to learn that Mrs. Simonin has resigned from the King’s Daughters, and for that reason will discontinue visiting here.

Mrs. Simonin has been an unfailing 2nd tireless worker for the uplift and encouragement of those in need of advice and sympathy, and her valued work here is deserving of the highest commendation.
