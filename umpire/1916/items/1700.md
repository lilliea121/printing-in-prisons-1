HAVE FAITH—SAIL ON!

When you go out into world again to face the future, you must be prepared to hear a knock now and then. But don’t let that dis- courage you in the least, you’ll always find the knocker in all walks of life, and like many other pests they will have to be endured for a time. Bear in mind that Columbus started for an unknown shore with a convict crew, and when the three little ships were believed to be lost and everything seemed dark, a majority of his men still had faith and cried, “‘Sail on! Sail on!”’

The great mind of Columbus had realized in dreams, the call of another country. He had heard the clamor of the people’s cry, ‘It can’t be done, Impossible!”” but he was fired with determination and belief in himself and his dreams, and he won.

Any tirne you may hear one say, ‘‘It can’t be done,” move along out of his presence as you would to get out of a foul atmosphere for fear of contamination. He has an infectious disease that is dangerous.
