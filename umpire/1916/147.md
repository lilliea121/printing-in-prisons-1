not belittle a growing change of sentiment.

‘“‘He has proved that at least a large percent-
age of ex-convicts can be trusted just like
men who never have been in prison; that they
are quite as industrious and able and perhaps
a bit more easily managed, since they have
undergone a discipline which would increase
the value of the average worker.

“‘It is one thing to prove a proposition and
quite another to popularize it!

““Witness Galileo, Newton, Harvey, and a
host of others who have made epochal dis-
coveries. :

“‘Yet this matter of fair play for ex-con-
victs is to be popularized—and all through the
efforts of a man who himself is a convict.

“Indeed, already its popularization has ad-
vanced to a stage of definite organization.

“Through the efforts of Winston Salisbury,
an inmate of the Kansas State Penitentiary
at Lansing, a national association known as
‘The Humanitarians’ has been incorporated,
with the governor of Kansas as vice-president,
and with men of the stamp of Governor De-
neen, of Illinois; former Governor Foss, of
Massachusetts; William Allen White, and
President Ripley, of the Santa Fe Railroad,
as advisers and supporters.

“The purpose of this association is to find
congenial jobs in congenial localities for men
discharged from prison or released on parole.

“The idea is to list individuals, firms and
corporations everywhere who will employ
members of the association, when properly
recommended. :

“‘Already several hundred business organi-
zations in more than half the states have
agreed to co-operate. With the movement
less than four months old, it has attracted
the attention and support of a considerable
number of men and institutions in every part
of the land. Hard-headed prison officials
have approved it.”’

THE MAN WITH A CROOKED
BRAIN

This particular one—as a litle newspaper
item relates—was sentenced to three years in
the penitentiary for burglary a quarter of a
century ago. Within a short time after his
release he was convicted, before the same
judge, for another burglary and given a ten-
year sentence. He had been at liberty but a
short time after serving the second sentence
when he broke into a butcher’s shop and
stole two hams. For that, under the habitual
‘eriminal act, he was given a life sentence; but
after serving nearly ten years he was pardoned.

We do not know how many thousand dol-
lars he cost the state, first and last; but we
are quite certain that neither he nor the
state got any good out of it. The presump-
tion, on the record, is that he is not fit to be
at large and will presently steal again and
get another prison sentence.

City police courts and. the circuit courts
constantly have such cases to deal with. The
mere fact that the same case comes back re-
peatedly is sufficieht evidence that, whatever

else should be done with unfortunates who
have these crooks in their brains, locking
them up under ordinary prison regimenis a
useless way of dealing with them. Under
surveillance in the open, with healthy work
to do, they might very likely be made of some
real use to themselves and to society.

If there is any possibility of usefulness in
any man, a walled hive of convicts is the
poorest place we can think of for bringing it
out. The ordinary state prison is usually the
most expensive public institution in the com-
monwealth.

*THE 51st PSALM VERSIFIED

In mercy look upon me, Lord,

Though great my crimes have been;
Wash out my foul iniquity

And cleanse me from my sin.

For numberless transgressions now
Before my soul arise;

Do thou from the dark catalogue
Turn off thy vengeful eyes.

Against Thee only have I sinned,
Though God of pardoning grace;

And righteous would the judgment be
That drove me from Thy face.

In wickedness I first was formed,
Deceit dwells in each part,

And lo! Thou asketh truth, but Thou
Must form anew my heart.

Purge me with hyssop, so shall I
As driven snow be pure;

Make me to hear Thy gladdening voice,
So I shall sin no more.

Look not upon my crimes, my God!
Oh! blot out every sin— :

Create in me a clean heart, Lord!
A spirit right within.

In anger cast me not away,
Nor let Thy Spirit leave

Thy penitent—but oh! to me,
Thy free salvation give.

Then will I speak in fearless truth
Of all Thy love to me,

And by example strive to lead
The wanderer unto Thee.

Deliver me from guilt of blood,
My Saviour and my God!

And my loosed tongue shall testify
Thy righteousness abroad.

No sacrifice that I could bring
Would for my sins atone;

But Thou will accept a contrite heart,
A sorrowing spirit own.

Do good in Thy pleasure, Lord!
To all who worship Thee—

Let Thy own Church with joy be filled,
With peace and purity.

Then shall the incense of the just
To Thy high throne ascend;

And Thou who lovest all Thy saints
Will to their prayers attend.
