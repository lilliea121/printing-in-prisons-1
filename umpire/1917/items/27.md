I will meet the influence of evil deeds already committed, with the indomitable courage of my present righteous resolve. For what I have done, Nature demands payment. Very welll 1 will discharge the debt. I will pay the bill to the last ounce of satisfaction. I will be square—with Nature, with God, with my fel- low-men and with myself. — Ohio Penitentiary. News.

But it is obvious that there are all kinds of useless hardships placed upon people that would not exist were it not for the self- ish greed that runs throughout the land.
