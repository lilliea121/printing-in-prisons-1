ROME'S GREAT COLOSSEUM

The most imposing theater ever built by mortal hands, says a writer in one of the current magazines, was a grim house of death, consecrated by blood and tears. The Colosseum stands today a stupendous monument to Roman pride and degradation. Almost a - third of a mile in circumference, it towers 157 feet up into the air, the original and mouamental ‘‘play to the gallery’’ of popular approval. In 80 A. D. Emperor Titus open- ed its history with a tremendous inaugural of a hundred days of ‘‘games,’”’ in which men fought with other men and with wild animals, and no one knows the exact tale of the lives snuffed out on its bloodied sand ‘‘to make a Roman holiday.”’

In the construction of the Colosseum its builders adhered to the then new note of super- imposing the three orders—Doric, Ionic and Corinthian—an idea that has exerted a great- er influence upon the design of monumental works than any other Roman innovation.

But who thinks of that standing before it today with the golden Italian sunshine glori- fying every scar and conjuring back from the dead past vivid spectacles of Roman holidays, full of noise and color, laughter and bloody agonies, or when liquid moonlight transfigures the classic ruin into a magic fabric, where stalk the thin ghosts of saints and vestal, slave and emperor?ROME'S GREAT COLOSSEUM
