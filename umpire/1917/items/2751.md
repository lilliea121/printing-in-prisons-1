PRISONERS MAY BE DRAFTED

According to a current report it is thought possible that Congress may pass a bill permitting the enlistment of state prisoners in the army and navy during the present war with Germans.

Joseph P. Byers, of this city, secretary of the National Prison Association, states that present indications point to the posssible drafting into the service of the United States army and navy of all prisoners in penal institutions who may be physically and mentally fit for military duties. This matter was thrashed out in detail at a meeting of the National Conference of Charities and Corrections, held at Pittsburg last week.

Mr. Byers attended the conference of delegates representing the penal institutions and seemed enthusiastic about the proposition of igsuing a call for a convention of the Governors of every State in the Union, to put before them the question of obtaining the necessary authority to draft the prisoners of available age into the U. S. service. The present ruling of the War Department extends the age limit to forty years.
