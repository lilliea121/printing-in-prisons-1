LINCOLN’S BIRTHDAY OBSERVED BY E. S. P. BAND CONCERT

Lincoln’s birthday anniversary was fiittingly observed at this institution by an unusually fine band concert on the Center, under the clever guidance of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt’s baton.

The eight numbers of the program were selected from the popular music of the day, which proved alike pleasing to the assembled guests.and to the inmates. A new which added to the pleasing effect of the music, was the introduction of a corps of buglers playing at certain parts of the over- tures. The results proved surprisingly good for an imitator effort. ;

The exit march, ‘‘Colonel Fitch,”” by Hall, terminated a pleasant afternoon of musical melody.
