Historic Pawnee RockPerhaps it may interest some of the readers of THE UMPIRE to learn that a short distance from Pawnee Rock Station, Kansas, is a high southward facing cliff of sandstone known as Pawnee Rock, projecting as a rocky promontory from the broad ridge that forms the north side of the valley. The elements and the hand of man, according to local report, have made great changes in its size and appearance since the days when the Santa Fe trail passed along its base. Here there were many encounters between the savages and the whites, and also between hostile bands of Indians; for the place is noted not only in pioneer history but in Indian traditions as well. Names and initials of many travelers, from the early trappers and the "forty-niners" to the later army detachments, have been scratched on the smooth faces of the ledges.-B4853.
