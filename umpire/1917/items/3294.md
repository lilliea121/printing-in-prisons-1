AN INGENIOUS LIFE PRESERVER

A strange type of life preserver has just been patented by G. E. and Gertrude Fell, of Buffalo. It has a water-tight mask to cover the nose and mouth, and this mask is connected by a tube with a periscope-like tower that floats on the water and is kept in an upright position by a righting weight. In order that there may be no strain on the air tube the floating air tower is secured by a chain to the victim, who also must be supported by floats under the arms.

It is said in behalf of the invention that it offers a minimum resistance to the seas in rough weathers and is especially suited for war conditions.
