MAN COUNTS FOR LITTLE

The things that are really ‘‘done,” which do not pass away in the doing but last on in fructifying power, are not done by man but by God. Man reaches out and tries to do some of the things which are clamoring to be done, but when they are really done it is not man who affects them but God. Therefore, it is that the more man identifies himself with God—and prayer is that very identification, since the heart of all prayer is: ‘‘Thy will be done’’—man finds himself at the center from which all forces and energy proceed.
