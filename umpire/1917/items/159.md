WONDERFUL HAND-WEAVING IN MEXICO

Those who have traveled through Mexico tell of the wonderful hand-woven blankets made by the Indian girls of Mexico, to whom a dime a day is a good wage, although they begin work at sunrise and labor until sunset. They are the admiration and despair of all who appreciate fine handiwork or value perfect color combinations. A small blanket boughtin Mexico City five years ago, although it has been used as a wall tapestry ever since, seems as brightin every one of itsrainbow colors as on the day it was bought. The weaving is so perfect that it has no right or wrong side.
