MUSIC AND SONG BY THE ORPHEUS CLUB

The annual visit of the Orpheus Club to this institution occurred on May 14, giving rare joy to the hearts of the inmates. Arthur Woodruff ‘wielded the baton as leader, while Ellis Clark Hammann presided at the piano. The ‘‘Road to Mandalay,” by Oley Sparks, was first sung, in which Noah Swayne, Jr., carried the solo part with a fine, even voice. This was followed by ‘‘The Briar Rose,’’ “Rolling Down to Rio’’ and ‘‘Lightly Flitted Around the Rose,’’ with Phillip Warren Cooke as soloist. Prolonged applause followed the rendition of the numbers, the final piece sung being ‘‘The Viking Song.”

One of the features of the afternoon not on the program, was the bringing out of the inmate Catholic Choir to sing the ‘‘Credo from Le Jeal’s Mass’’ in D, the E. S. P. orchestra assisting. This proved a surprise “hit” to the club members and guests. As a final it was suggested by the President of the Orpheus, Alexander Van Rensselaer, that all present join in singing ‘‘The Star Spangled Banner,” which was carried out with ringing enthusiasm, to the delight of all.
