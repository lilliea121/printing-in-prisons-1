ANTI-NARCOTIC BILL INTRO- DUCED AT HARRISBURG

A Harrisburg correspondent states that a sweeping anti-narcotic bill was introduced in the House of Representatives last week by Samuel A. Whitaker, of Chester County. “Under its terms it becomes a crime for any person but a druggist, physician or other

authorized person to possess a habit-forming

drug and unlawful for any physician to pre- seribe narcotics to patients who seek to *be cured of the habit, without filing with the Director of Health, or other local health of- ficer, the name, address and other informa- tion concering the patient, as well as a diag- nosis of each case and the nature and amount of drug prescribed.

“The act also provides detail forms which physicians, druggists and others qualified to possess a drug must fill out and place on file for official inspection at any time. It makes unlawful the selling, distribution, pre- seribing or giving away of any habit-forming drug except under the conditions imposed in the bill. Druggistsare forbidden to dispense a drug except upen a prescription of a phy- sician, and also are required to obtain from the physician a written order, signed and properly dated, which must be kept .for two years, sccessible for official inspection at any time. Veterinarians are forbidden the banned drugs for use of a human being.”” -
