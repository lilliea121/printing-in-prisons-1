A NEW WORD, BUT OLD IDEA

We have anew word —camouflage. A new word, but not a new idea or a new art. We have had the camouflage girl with us for some time. Camouflage, so the dictionary people tells us, means painting to deceive the eye. It is an art that is being employed in the war. The tops of submarines are being painted to look like the rippling green sea waves. Battleships and cruisers are being painted so that their hulls will blend with the gray sea mists. Along the war front camouflage is being used to convey the impression to the enemy balloon and airplane observers that batteries are located where they are not, also conceal the real location of guns, ammunition cellars and strategic troop movements. Paint is used to deceive the eye. That is camouflage. Butis it a new thing undeér the sun? Go to! It is not so! Are we not all distressingly familiar with the camouflage girl? The idea is just ‘the same when applied to faces,we take it, as in the case of the submarines and the terrible tanks to deceive the eye of the critical observer.

Camouflage as applied to ships and armored tanks may be more or less of a success, but as applied to the ladies it doesn’t fool even the wayfaring man.
