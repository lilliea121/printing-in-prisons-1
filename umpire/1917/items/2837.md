SECOND BLOCK NOTES The women of the 2nd Block wish to extend their thanks to little Irene Trost, who came as a little sunbeam, bright and early, July 4th, and passed candy to all on the 2nd Block. Instead of buying fireworks for herself and her companions, she thought of us poor, unfortunate women behind the bars, and did her best to brighten our corner. We also wish to thank her mother, Freida, our cook, for her kindness in giving us ice cream in the afternoon. Our most earnest prayer is that mother and daughter may be happily reunited in the near future, and that they may enjoy to the fullest the happiness that we trust shall be theirs. Freida, our cook, got tired reading about the other blocks having flags, and to show that she has the right spirit she purchased a dandy flag, so now the stars and stripes of "Old Glory" proudly wave o'er the 2nd Block. Long may it wave. WOMEN OF THE 2ND BLOCK.
