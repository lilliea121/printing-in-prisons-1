Philadelphia, May 18, 1917. To the Officers and Members of the Honor and Friendship Club. Dear Friends:

We, the girls of the 2nd Block, wish to extend to you our sincere and heartfelt thanks for the entertainment furnished to us recently. Words can not express to you our high appreciation of this courtesy which was extended to us and we congratulate you most cordially on the ex- cellent result of the same.

We also take this opportunity of offering to you our assistance in any way in which we may be of any help to you in the uplift of your Club; we are always willing and ready to help.

Recently we learned that the mother of one of our girls was greatly in need of help, so it was decided to take up a collection for her benefit. The result was most gratifying, the sum of three dollars and fifty cents having been collected and presented to her.

With best wishes for the future welfare and success of your Club, we are

Sincerely yours, 
Freida Trost. 
Maria Smothers. 
Mrs. Boal, Matron. 
Per Mrs. R. C. McKenty, Representative Delegate.
