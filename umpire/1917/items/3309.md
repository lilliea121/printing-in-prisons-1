RT. REV. BISHOP McCORT CONFIRMS 45 MEN

On Thanksgiving Day 45 inmates of this institution received the Holy Sacrament of Confirmation, the right Rev. Bishop McCort officiating.

The prison Chapel was beautifully decorated with an abundance of flowers and palms and a select musical program was rendered by the local Catholic choir with orchestra accompaniment.

Assisting Bishop McCort with the services were the Rev. Michael J. Oâ€™Shea, S. J., and Rev. Benedict Guldner, S. J. There was also present the Rev. Patrick Quill, S. J., Rev. Charles E. Bowles, and Rev. H. Borgmann, C. S. S., Chaplain Joseph Welch, Warden Robt. J. McKenty, and a large number of visitors. Many members of the Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners were on hand to congratulate the newly made communicants of the Church. 

Before confirming the men Bishop McCort addressed the class as soldiers of the Eternal King, pointing out the importance of the sacrament and the need of living upright lives in the future as members of the Holy Catholic Church.
