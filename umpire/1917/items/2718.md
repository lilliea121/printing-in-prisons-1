HAVE A PURPOSE

Young man, have you a purpose in life? The question strikes you with something of a novelity. Yet it is the great one on which your future place in the world depends. If no life pursuit is yet formed in your mind, it is full time that you sit down and spend a season in grave reflection. Without an ear- nest purpose nothing worth accomplishing can be done in the world. Thought, will, energy, work—these are the elements of all success. These are the materials out of which men construct their fortunes and if you are dreaming of wealth, honor or position in the future and have not these to build on, and with advancing years, will see the beautiful structure that now rises pleasantly in your fancy, fading away like the baseless fabric of vision. Gird up your loins, and in good earnest seek to acquire the highest ability in your art, calling or profession. Let each day see you advancing in skill and knowledge; and as certain as the sun shines, orthe water runs you will rise above the common mass. And just in the degree that your motives are honorable and unselfish, you will add happiness to your success in life.
