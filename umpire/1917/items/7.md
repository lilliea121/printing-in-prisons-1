PREJUDICE A STUMBLING-BLOCK

One of the great stumbling-blocks to be overcome in life’s struggles is prejudice. In other words the pre-judgment of others, which is usually formed without examining the facts, a hasty acceptance of a conclusion withput investigating the evidence upon which it is formed; it is allowing ourselves to be hoodwinked and deceived, when careful re- flection would keep us from such a mistake; it is drinking in hearsay when proof should be forthcoming; it is putting aside all else at first sight, which fails to confirm our first convictions or suit our former belief or agree with our preconceived ideas; it is a persist- ent hesitation to accept as true what we do not wish to believe; a mean unwillingness to admit that we can be in the wrong and others in the right. Its weakness is that it con- demns or favors upon the slightest excuse; and embraces or rejects as it is moved by .mere caprice. Furthermore, it is not limited alone to persons, nor to class, sect or creed, but is carried on to parties and systems, and often finds an abiding-place among the most high.

Prejudice is likened unto plants that grow upon rocks, that seem to stick fast though they have no roots penetrating the inter- stices. It is a pestiferous thing that speaks with partial accents and listens with itching ears; it clings to that which it should not, and lets go that to which it should adhere, and when defeated in a fair showing, it still remains defiant, sullen, and obstinate. A noted author bas said that ‘‘prejudice finds nothing too low or mean for its love, or too high for its ha- . tred; nothing is too sacred from its attacks, or too deserving to be freed from its slanders.”’
