PRAYER

Thy heart to my heart, great King of kings, Throbbing its love and such glad things, Thou thinking to me, God, as I fain would to Thee, Unfolding Thy purpose, Thy love, Thy great plan, Thy heritage sure for each child »f man; Thy infinite patience with slowness and sin, Thus proving Thy power all love to win; Thou, taking my thoughts and transmuting to gold Their dross and their alloy, with pity untold; Thou, blending Thy will with mine own Freely proffered to Thee, Thus possessed by Thyself, yetroyally free;— This then is Prayer, God ¢f all souls, Such communing with -Thee: therefore, O Father, Think Thou to me.- ~ —A. M. C. Dupree.
