A COTTON LEGEND It is said that cotton was the theme of one of the most fabulous nature stories on its first introduction into Europe. Travelers related that in Tartary there grew a shrub that when its ripe fruit was cut open within was "a lyttle Beaste in flesche, in bone and blode as though it were a lyttle Lamb with outer wolle." The flesh of this "vegetable lamb" was eaten, ran the story, and the wool made into cloth. The basis of the legend is the way in which the cotton pod ripens and bursts, showing the white fluffy raw cotton, which closely resembles wool. Raw cotton is called "cotton wool."
