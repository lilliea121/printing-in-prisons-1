THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCE

It can be safely asserted that the indeterminate sentence is fast gaining new advocates as time advances, and if one may judge from present indications, it will not be long before that method of passing sentence upon law-breakers becomes general in this country. As matters now stand, no two judges give the same sentence for a similar offense, which is the cause of much dissatisfaction to many because it works extreme hardship to some, while others fare well and are permitted to escape the rigors of the law with a light sentence.

It was recently declared by a well-known New York jurist that the failure of our present penal code was largely due to the manner in treating prisoners. The fact that more than half of the prison inmates are old offenders, averred the judge, is ‘‘principally because there was no real attempt to study the conditions of the criminal mind. When prisoners are turned out at the end of a specified term, they are little changed in thought and soon drift back into their own haunts and into crime.’’

As a fact, no man can discern with any degree of precision just how long a man ought be locked up in order to protect society against the commission of crime. “Where one judge may impose a term of three years on an offender, another judge, having had a heavy dinner the night before, might pronounce the maximum of ten years for the same culprit.” To remedy this evil, it was suggested that the indeterminate sentence be adopted, ‘‘leaving it with an independent board of parole vested with the power to bring the prisoner before the court for judgment.’’

Referring to the indeterminate method of imposing sentence in New York state, it was declared to be ‘‘one of the greatest steps ever taken in prison reform, and had worked out most admirably.” In conjunction with the present system, the establishment of a psychiatic ward for examination of prisoners was averred to be necessary to proper scientific handling of the great problem.

By providing an indeterminate sentence, it was asserted, ‘‘prisoners may be referred to the board of parole by the judge, with a maximum number of years as the sentence. In case an offender is sentenced for three years and the board decides that after one year he has been sufficiently impressed with his responsibilities to society to be discharged, the prisoner is set free, with the remaining two years as a term of probation.” Again if at the end of a stipulated term, it is thought that the prisoner is still unfit for release, his sentence may be extended to fit the requirements of the case.
