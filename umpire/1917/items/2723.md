A GREAT UNDERTAKING

Once more the Parliament of Holland is considering the problem of draining the Zuider Zee. Centuries ago the work of land reclamation was begun, but previous attempts along that line yielded but comparatively slight areas of land, as compared with the present endeavor. Itis estimated that by means of the pending project a tract of 500,000 acres of the finest land will be gained for agricultural purposes. The plan, as now contemplat- ed, calls for a dam from North Holland to the Friesland coast,—twenty-four miles,—of which the land of Wieringen,—five miles wide,—will constitute animportant section. The estimated cost of the work is $44,220,000. The vast sum is considerea none too much, in consideration of the end to be accomplished. If, by some means, mankind could be as strongly impressed with the importance of saving perishing souls,—no matter at what cost,—there would be no scarcity of either money or workers. All would be aflame with missionary enthusiasm.
