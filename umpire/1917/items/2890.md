BRITISH REGIMENTAL MOTTOES

The Irish Division in adopting the motto ““Ever and Always Faithful’’ have chosen one not already claimed by any British regiment or division. The nearest is the‘‘Ever Faithful’’ of the Devonshire Regiment. As a rule little originality seems to have been shown in selecting regimental mottoes.

At least a dozen have ‘‘Quis separabit?’’ while even more are proud of ‘“Nemo me impune lacessit.’’ Three regiments adopted ‘“Montis insignia Calpe,’’ for no other reason than that it forms part of the arms of Gibraltar.

The Royal Irish Fusiliers: with ‘‘Faugh-a ballagh” ("Clear the way") are the only regiment with an Irish motto; the Seaforth Highlanders stick to the Scotch “‘Cuidich’n Rhi’’ (“Help to the King'’), while the Welsh Guards swear by ““Cymruam Byth’’ (Wales for ever”).
