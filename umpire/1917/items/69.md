ELECTING A PRESIDENT

The power of Congress to deal with Elec- toral College returns is answered by a writer in the New York Tribune, who says:

““The electoral commission established the precedent that Congress should not seek to go behind certificates regularly submitted by recognized state governments. That princi- ple is aiso embodied in the Edmunds law of 1887, which defined and enlarged the power of Congress to deal with Electoral College returns.

“This Act directs that if any state shall have provided by law before the selection of electors for the final determination of con- tests regarding their appointment, the state’s decision shall be final unless the regularity of the state’s action is questioned by both houses of Congress.

“If two or more returns are received these rules govern:

“First—If the state shall have determined that the votes forwarded in one of the re- turns were given regularly, those votes shall be counted.

“Second—If two authorities, each claim- ing regularity, shall both have determined that the different sets of voters were regu- larly cast, then Congress must decide which set shall be accepted.

““Third—If the state shall have made no determination, then Congress shall be free to determine. But if the houses can not agree, the votes of those electors whose ap- pointment is certified by the governor shall be counted.

““The general purport of the Act is to rec- ognize the right of Congress to decide all disputed questions in regard to the counting of electoral votes which the state has not decided or has decided irregularly.’’
