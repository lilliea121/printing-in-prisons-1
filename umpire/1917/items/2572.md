DISTANCE LENDS ENCHANTMENT

It has often been said that nearly every fellow lives in hope that some day he will be able to quit the kind of work he is doing. If it is hard work, he wants to do something easy, and if it is easy he wants a position that isn’t so confining. If he has a job where he works in an office part of the time and on the street part of the time he wants to get into something where he wo'n’t always have to be running in and out.

There is the clerk doing store work who thinks he would like a place where he wouldn’t have to work regular hours, and the man whose time belongs to himself thinks he would like to be a clerk. "When you are through with the day’s work,” he says to the clerk, “you’re through, but I have always got something to worry me.”’

Frequently a husband thinks that doing housework and talking to the neighbor is a snap, and wife feels that she would be perfectly happy if she could go out and work like a man does.

Nearly every one is at times dissatisfied with his or her job and is determined that his son shall not do that kind of work. Even the fellow who draws an enormous salary isn’t contented—he feels he ought to be doing something else.
