THE TENREC

One of the strangest animals known zoologists is the tenrec. an insect-eating animal found only in the island of Madagascar. It is supposed to represent a very ancient type of animal which is now almost extinct. Madagascar, once a part of the mainland of the African continent, was separated there from at a very remote period in the past. As a result a fauna peculiar to the island has been developed.
