BRITISH TO RECRUIT NEGROES

It was announced by a Chicago correspondent recently, that the British recruiting mission in that city is attempting to raise a battalion of negroes, subjects of Great Britain, in Chicago. If the effort is successtul the battalion will be trained in Chicago and later attached to the British army, with British pay.

The mission is also recuiting among friendly aliens. This departure was taken because of many applications from Poles and Bohemians. It is said that this will afford service to many not eligible at present to serve in the United States Army.
