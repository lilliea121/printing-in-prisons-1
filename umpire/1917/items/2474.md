WELL-KNOWN ROCKAWAY BEACH SEIZED AS SITE FOR FORT It has recently been announced by New York reports that a commission of New York state now has power to seize land at Rockaway Beach desired by the War Department for coast defense purposes. Under an emergency message from Governor Whitman the legislature passed the enabling act with only one dissenting vote. It is understood that the commission will act without delay and that a deed of the property will be sent to Secretary Baker in a few days. The construction of fortifications at Rockaway Beach, designed to protect the city and especially the borough of Brooklyn, is already under way.
