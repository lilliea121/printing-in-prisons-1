THINK WELL OF MANKIND

“I am far from thinking that all those who have depreciated our species have been ene- mies to virtue, and have exposed the frailties of their fellow-creatures with any bad intention. I must, however, be of opinion, that the sentiments of those who are inclined to think favorably of mankind, are more advantageous to virtue than the contrary principles, which gives us a mean opinion of our nature. When a man is prepossessed with a high notion of his rank and character he will naturally endeavor to act up to it, and will scorn to de a base or vicious action which might put him below that figure which he makes in his own imagination.”

—Hume.
