NEW YORK’S GREAT SUBWAYS

More than 2000 trains start each day from the terminals of New York’s subway systems. They are run on schedules as carefully prepared and as closely timed as those of a trunk line railroad.

Between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 persons ride each day on the subway. This is more than twice the number carried daily by all the trains on the entire Pennsylvania railroad system.

Nearly two-thirds of the New York users of the subway are carried during the morning and evening rush hours.
