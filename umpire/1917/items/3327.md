HISTORIC GUNS

The largest cannon bore recorded is a gun of 28 inches calibre, at Bejapur, India, during the seventeenth century, and known as “Malick o Meiran’’ signifying ‘‘Lord of the seventeenth century, and known as "Malick o Meiran" signifying "Lord of the Plains." By some authorities it is said to have been made of cast iron and by others of bronze. Cast iron cannon were not made until the latter half of the fifteenth century. Previously they were always made of bronze. As the Bejapur gun was not completed until nearly two hundred years after the introduc- tion of cast iron for guns, the question may be genuinely open to doubt. But be that as it may, the projectile fired by the gun weighed 1,600 pounds, and at the time it must have been a formidable weapon.

The 111-ton guns of the Bendow, the Brit- ish battleship built in 1885, used a projectile of 1,800 pounds, so the Mahrattas, said to be responsible for the Indian gun, have no cause to feel ashamed for the capabilities of their earlier weapon. Italy purchased in1884 from the Krupp firm a 119-ton gun, and the same firm six years later made a 145-ton gun, which is at Cronstadt, at the head of the Gulf of Finland, in Russia.
