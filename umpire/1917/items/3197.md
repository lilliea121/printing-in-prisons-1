GOOD TIMES AFTER THE WAR

It is asserted that unprecedented growth in the foreign trade in the United States has been accompanied by a beneficial chenge in its charater. The most important change is an increase in exports of manufactured gocds and a decrease in imports of the same class.

In a recent interview by a Washington correspondent, Dr. Pratt, chief of the Government’s bureau of commerce predicted that America will be in a better position after the war than now to develop foreign trade. He says; “‘I believe it is absurd that Euro- pean nations will be able to do more after the war than they did before. I believe that domestic wants will have to be filled before European nations can seriously undertake foreign trade. Ihave yet to find the practical man largely engaged in exporting who believes he will do less business abroad after the war than he did before.
