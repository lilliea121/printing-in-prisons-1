CANALS OF VENICE

The canals of Venice are a part of the Adriatic sea. The city is built on 118 small islands or shoals in the gulf of Venice. These islets are connected by several hundred bridges and the direction of the canals, of which there are nearly 200, are so formed as to constitute the “highways.” Thus it is due to the situation of this city and not to special intention of man that it has canals instead of paved streets.
