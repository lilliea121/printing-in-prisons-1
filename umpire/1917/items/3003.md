A REMARKABLE FEAT

It is told of a forester, Elijah Coleman, of Portland, Ore., that he accomplished a most remarkable feat recently, by making of himself a sledge on the snow-clad upper slopes of Mount Hood, he managed to save Hans Fuhrer, a badly injured mountain guide, who is now in a hospital and who is expected to recover.

Yuhrer had guided a party of men and women to the summit, 11,000 feet up. When a mile from the top on the descent Fuhrer fell on the sharp blade of an axe, receiving a serious wound in the abdomen.

Coleman, the lookout, had been watching the party through a glass from the summit and saw the accident. He slid, coasted and plunged down the intervening mile in a few minutes. With other members of the party he stanched Fuhrerâ€™s wound. Then, throwing himself flat on his back, he drew Fuhrer on his body and directed those in the party to attach a rope to his feet. Holding the wounded man with his clasped arms, Coleman was dragged over the snow two miles to the timber line. There the wounded man was placed in an automobile and brought to the city.
