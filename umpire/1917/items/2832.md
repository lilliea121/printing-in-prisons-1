POWERFUL NEW LIGHT INVENTED

It is announced that a powerful artificial light that can not be distinguished from daylight has been hailed with delight by illuminating engineers. It is claimed that the light, which is transmitted by a flaming arc lamp, will prove of inestimable value to the arts and sciences. It will be used in photograph and movie studios and in the paint and dye industries for color matching in the laboratory.

Also, wholesale and retail clothing houses will find the white light valuable in the salesroom, it is said, as the color values are practically identical with those of daylight. It is claimed that the light also will replace the greenish-hued mercury vapor lights in studio and engraving rooms.
