To the Members of the H. F. C.

Dear Sirs:â€”I appreciate the compliment the H. F. C. has paid me in electing me to honorary membership in the Club and also delegate of the 2nd Block.

Sincerely yours, 
Mrs. Reuben C. McKenty.

To the Warden and Members of the H.F.C.: 
The members of the 2nd Block wish to thank you all for the kindness which was shown them in giving the minstrel show. They all enjoyed it and hope to be able to have another show in the near future. 
2nd Block Delegate.
