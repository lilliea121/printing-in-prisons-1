LIFE AND THE SPIRIT All life must rise to so nothing in the spirit, Some height of nobleness in deed and thought. We face the battle not to flee or fear it, Or be cajoled, or trifled with or bought. We must be linked with that high spiritual vision That sees beyond our daily trivial cares If we would stamp on life with true precision Our faith that conquers all our brief despairs. Vaster our energies of high contentions Against the dragnet of the sundering wrong If with high-souled and spiritual intention We save ourselves by helping lift the throng. â€”Boston Post.
