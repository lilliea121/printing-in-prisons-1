The great American sin of today is profanity. ''The use o:f profane language is not confined to the street loafer, to the thug or the sot; men who move in good society, business men of standing and reputation, young men and old men, and even boys of tender age are addicted to this inexcusable habit and sin,'' says Thomas (Okla.) Tribune. There is nothing more disgusting than to hear a man punctuate his every utterance with lurid oaths.
