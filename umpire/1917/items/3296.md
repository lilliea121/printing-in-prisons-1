A BIG FIND OF MANGANESE

It is announced that a great strike of manganese has been made in the Leadville district at the old Bohen mine.

Since the opening of the deposit its development has attained the height of twelve feet and progressed a distance of forty feet without the top walls of the ore body being reached. Its width is between twelve and fifteen feet. The remarkably high grade of the ore rather than the huge size of the deposit gives the discovery prominence, for it is said to assay between 35 to 40 per cent. Further, the ore is unusual because it contains only 8 per cent. silica and 14 per cent. iron.
