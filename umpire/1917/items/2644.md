TOOK A PENNY TIP

“About three years ago,’’ says E. M. Statler in the American Magazine, ‘‘one of the boys in our Cleveland house was called to the room of a Nashville, Tennessee, banker. The boy did what he was asked to do, and did it promptly and courteously. As he started to leave, the banker handed him a penny. Instead of showing pique or surprise, the boy quietly thanked the guest and went out, closing the door carefully.

‘‘Five minutes later the banker came rushing up to the desk.

“I just called a boy to my room,’ he exclaimed. ‘I want to see him again.” The boy was sent for.

“A few minutes ago,’ said the banker, ‘I thought it was a dime. It seemed to make no difference with you; if it had been a dollar you couldn’t have been more courteous. Here, take this!” and he handed the boy a five-dollar bill.

“This incident supports a fact thatI try to impress on every one who works for me, that constant courtesy and attention to little things will bring them success.’’
