PRISONERS TO KNIT FOR SOLDIERS

A Sacramento, Cal., correspondent reports that a plan to have some of the prisoners at the Folsom State Penitentiary knit for Uncle Sam’s soldiers in the trenches was suggested recently by Joseph Stephens, Chairman of the local branch of the Red Cross, to Gov. William D. Stephens and received favorable consideration.

The local Red Cross has a number of knitting machines for making sox, sweaters and ‘‘helmets’’ for the soldiers, and it is planned to let the prisoners use these if the authorities favor the scheme.
