GET CLOSE Many a General, since Time got to going, has bitterly learned the futility of fighting a battle at long range. Also many a Business Man has learned to his sorrow, the disaster back of a distant relationship between himself and his customers. Step a Step Closer. Individual supremacy and power result from combat, whether or not it is a Battle at Arms, a Battle in Business, or a Battle with your own self. And the Closer you get to your Opponent the surer you are of Victory. Step a Step Closer. Another thing to remember—Imagination is a powerful factor in Success and the Closer you are to your work or your Opposition, the bigger will be your Vision, the more will you see, and the clearer will loom the real Purpose back of each effort that you make in life. Step a Step Closer. Close quartered you are able to detect defects and correct them. Close centered there is no lost motion, but power in every stroke. If you will but apply the suggested thoughts back of this little talk to your work today, larger growth is sure. You will be a bigger man or woman. —George Mathew Adams.
