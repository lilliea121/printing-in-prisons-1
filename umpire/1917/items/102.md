BOY SENTENCED TO BE SPANKED

Loud wails, mingled with sounds of scuf- fling, emanating from the office of Probation Officer Hackney on the fifth floor of City Hall recently startled attaches, who opened the door in time to see a boy getting an old- fashioned spanking, a sentence imposed a short time before by Judge Patterson on a sixteen-year old youth from North Gratz Street.

The boy was accused of stealing $500 from his employer, Frederick A. De Haven, of West Hortter Street. He spent $108 of this on a trip to New York before being appre- hended. Owing to the prisoner’s youth, the Court decided to treat the case as a juvenile one. As the boy’s father was present, the Judge said: ,

““Tf you can give him a good old-fashioned spanking I will suspend sentence and place him on probation until he is twenty-one years old.”’
