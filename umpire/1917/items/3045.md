PRISONERS BUILDING CHURCH

A correspondent from Sunbury, Pa., announces that owing to the shortage in the labor market at that place, the situation is being met in an unusual way, in the building of the new $50,000 St. Johnâ€™s Methodist Episcopal Church. Across the street is the Northumberland County Prison, with fifty idle convicts. By arrangement with Warden Barr, the more trusted ones are allowed to work on the job. The men eat and sleep in the jail, and it is said that they are allowed $2.50 a day, the same as paid other workmen, and have done satisfactory work, according to the boss.
