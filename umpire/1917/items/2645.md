WHERE THE OCEAN IS DEEPEST

A most peculiar fact about oceans of the world is that the largest depressions are to be found near the coast lines. The largest of these are all in the Pacific, two of them being near island coast lines, says the Popular Science Monthly for May. The ‘‘Swire Deep,’’ just off the Philippines, measures no less than 33,000 feet from the surface of the ocean to the bottom. This is just 3,000 feet deeper than Mount Everest, in Asia, is high. The “Aldrich Deep," in the South Pacific, ranks next to this, being nearly 31,000 feet deep. The thirdis the “Tuscarora Deep,” near Japan, which soundings indicate to be 27,600 feet in depth. This would then make the boettom of the Tuscarora Deep over two and three-eights miles below the average level of the bottom of the ocean.
