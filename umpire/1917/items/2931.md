THE MODERN SAMSON

When Samson found himself at lastin the banquet hall of the lordsof the Philistines he leaned against the pillars and brought down the roof—thus destroying himself and all others beneath it.

William II had leaned hard on the pillars of monarchy. The Romanoff pillar cracked and Nicholas was crushed in the ruin. Constantine fell when the supports of his dynasty broke beneath the strain and Hohenzollern friendship. Now Alphonso is threatened with disaster as the result of William’s intrigues, and Austria’s young Emperor sees his government crumbling for the sins of Potsdam. Even Sweden’s king has heard rumblings of menace.

There is this difference between Samson of old and Samson of today—the former destroyed his enemies, the latter is destroying his friends, or those who have refused to become his open foes. 

But there will be no difference in the result to Samson. He, too, will perish.
