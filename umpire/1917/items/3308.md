BROADWAY LINE RUN BY WOMEN

New Yorkers were surprised the other day when a number of young women made their first appearance on the Broadway lines as street railway conductors, filling the vacancies represented by as many blue starson the service flag of the New York Railway Company. The young women are in uniformed blue skirts and rather mannish coats with caps like those of the men conductors.

It is said that most of the women stick to their jobs after a tryout and the railway officials consider the innovaticn a success.
