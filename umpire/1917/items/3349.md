THE GREAT HIGHWAY

As I came down the great highway 
The river hills were bright with dew, 
And where the hill trees lined the way 
The morning light was streaming through 
I do not know if you have felt 
The thrill of beauty when the day 
Is breaking through the river mists 
So softly delicate and gray— 
But God was in His Heaven then, 
As I came down the great highway. 

Within a day so many pass 
Upon that wide and brimming road, 
But do they all, I wonder, know 
That beauty there-has her abode? 
Do their hearts, too, make tender songs 
For beauty of the summer day— 
For willows mirrored in the stream, 
And great green hills in their array? 
I wondered while my own heart sang, 
As I came down the great highway.

The great highway is there for all 
To travel as their fancies choose— 
The great boats welcome and the small, 
Alike for all their gallant crews. 
Within a day so many pass, 
But do their fancies ever play, 
As children might, in that broad road, 
Delightfully? I cannot say. 
I only know my own heart sang 
As I came down the great highway.
