An exchange mentions the fact that Warden Murphy, of the Oregon State Penitentiary, recently put twenty-six members of the "honor gang" to the supreme test when he sent them forth to capture one of their fellow-prisoners who had violated the privilege extended to him. Every one of the men re- turned, and they brought the fugitive with them. It is an encouraging condition, in the larger penal and correctional institutions everywhere in the United States, that the persons responsible for the conduct of the inmates are learning that those in their charge can, in most instances, be trusted. When the prisoners themselves learn this, their restoration will be an easy next step.
