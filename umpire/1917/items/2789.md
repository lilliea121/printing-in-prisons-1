THE TRUE SPIRIT

We know what will happen in the long run to this country, but we don’t know much about the intermediate processes. We know it is a great country, with lots of good people in it, and destined to a great future, but whatups and down it mayhave we don’t know. If great mistakes creep into its guidance it will suffer, and it will have to share the consequences of the sins of the world. That is the common lot, and we need not lose sleep over it, but we should take thought always that the spirit of the country is honorable and sound. It should not be timid nor lazy nor overbearing. It should be the spirit of a gentleman, of truth, of helpfulness, of patience, of humility sweetened, perhaps, by humor and of the ready courage that rates all material gains below honor. Whenever such a spirit shines out—out of a man’s eyes, out of a country’s eyes, as now of France— it wins. Everybody loves the spirit of a gentleman when they get the real thing.
