REGISTRATION COMPLETED

Acting upon direct instructions from the War Department at Washington, Warden Robert J. McKenty has completed the registration of all male prisoners at this institution between the ages of 21 and 31 years. Approximately 500 inmates came under the Registration Act. While army and navy regulations positively forbid the enlistment of persons who are or have been under sentence of a court in a reformatory, jail or penitentiary, the present law makes it mandatory that all prisonersâ€™ names be registered that come within the prescribed ages.
