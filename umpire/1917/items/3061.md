FOOD CONSERVATION IN 1777

An interesting historical fact, brought to public attention by Senator Henry L. Myers, of Montana, is that the Congress of 1777 engaged in grain preservation just as the Congress of today.is doing, and on February 27 of that year adopted a resolution reading:

“Resolved, That it be recommended to the several Legislatures of the United States, immediately to pass laws the most effectual for putting an immediate stop to the pernicious practise of distilling grajn, by which the most extensive evils are likely to be derived, if not quickly prevented.’’

Senator Myers, after dwelling upon the wisdom and patriotism of the Continental legislators, appealed to the Senators to catch up with their ancestors.
