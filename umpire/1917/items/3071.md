TATTOOING ABOLISHED FROM NAVY

It is announced that America’s infant industry, the placing of skirts and flowing draperies on immodest tattoo decorations on seamen, has come to a sudden death in consequence of the order of Josephus Daniels, Secretary of the Navy, placing a new restriction against the Navy League of the United States.

There are, therefore, a vast army of tattoo artists out of jobs, and quite a lot more men, formerly seamen of the United States Navy, going around and biting pieces out of bars and speaking unprintable words because they can see no way to get into the war. The Navy League, because of its fight with Mr. Daniels, has had to close up its tattooing headquarters, in which it fixed up experienced seamen for service. It’s a long, sad story, mates.
