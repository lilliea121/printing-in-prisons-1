CURIOUS FRENCH DUEL

It is said that Charles Coypeau, Sieur d’Assonci, a French poet and musician of the seventeenth century, relates in his book ‘‘Adtures,’’ that his father and mother were one day engaged in a discussion on questions of law when a dispute arose between them as to the precise signification and bearing of a provision in Justinian’s code with respect to the rights of brothers.

Ultimately the quarrel waxed so furious that the disputants lost all control of themselves, defied each other to single combut, and proceeded to settle their difference and determine the mind of the ancient legislator by a fight with swords.

This singular duel took place in their son’s presence. Coypeau, pere, was an advocate by profession and a member of one of the French parliaments. Madame was exceedingly diminutive and bad to wear exceedingly high pattens to approach the ordinary stature of women, but she was fierce and domineering in temper. The combat seems to have been a drawn battle, and the sense of Justinian remained as secure and debatable as ever.
