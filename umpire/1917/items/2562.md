E. S. P. LEAGUE OPENS BASEBALL SEASON

The E. S. P. League baseball season of 1917 opened at the Storehouse grounds on Wednesday last in accordance with the plans previously arranged by the President and of- ficers of the league. '

Assembling at the designated rendezvous at 3 P. M., the ball players composing the sev- eral clubs of the league were formed in line by their managers for the opening parade. In the meantime Prof. A. F. Wiegandt had as- sembled the members of the E. S. P. band at headquarters and played several patriotic airs, so that when the signal to start was given, the excitement of the baseball fans had worked up to fever heat, and enthusiasm ran high.

Headed by the band and officers of the league, the line of march around the peni- tentiary grounds was taken up by the parad- ers amid the flare of trumpets andstrains of martial music. After the indicated route had been covered, the leaguers were counter- marched for review by the Warden and offi- cials, and after saluting the Stars and Stripes, the clubs broke ranks, marching off to play ball at the scheduled grounds: B 6936 featured in the rear of the paraders, carrying a water bucket, sponge and duster, fully prepared to render succor to any one suffering from over exertion or hot-air stroke. Thus the baseball season at the E. S. P. opened, with each team manager fully confident of carrying off the honors at the end of the season.
