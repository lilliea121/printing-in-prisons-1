IF I COULD KNOW

If I could know the agony of pain 
In which my brother wrought, yet gave no sign, 
His bungling work would take on graceful shape, 
And glory would illumine every line. 

If I could know the heartache bravely hid 
Beneath the smiles of courage, day by day, 
I’d not withhold the kindly deed and thought 
To cheer my friend upon his lonely way. 

If I could know the struggle to do right, 
Oh that poor fallen one so sore beset, 
Not ‘‘shame,’’ but ‘‘bravo,” would I cry to him; 
“Thou fightest foes whom I have never met,’’

If I could know the longing pressing close 
Beneath the derision’s sneer at holy things, 
A friendly hand I’d stretch across the gulf 
And know the thrill which world-wide kin- ship brings. 

And I can know! Come, Son of Man, divine, 
Flood all my soul with sympathy benign,
Until my very life is love impearled,
And pulses with the heart-throbs of the world.
