ONLY 

Only a little tiny spark, Falling so softly down; In one short hour a frightful glare Shall rouse the sleeping town.

Only a little spiteful word, A scarcely noted sneer, Finding a sunny, joyous heart,

Leaving behind—a tear.

-Only a careless, mocking smile, A fooljsh, ill-timed jest;

It quenched the dawning of a love, Too weak to bear the test.

Only the shadow of a doubt, The whisper of a friend,

It sent two lives to grieve apart, Mistaken to the _ua.

Oniy a little broken toy, Shabby and old and torn,

1t woke the memory of a loss Too heavy to be borne.

Only the little daily wants Left at the gate of prayer, Taking instead the golden spoil, Won from the Master there.

— Selected.
