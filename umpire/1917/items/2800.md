“FLOWER MISSIONS”

Oftimes people begrudge the expenditure of money to beautify the home or to bring the comforting message of true friendship to others in their time of trouble. To them flowers are of no use, and pictures or music seem a waste of money. But a life entirely restricted to things that are worn on the back or go into the mess-kettle are bound to result in starving the spirit—the joy of living. It has been said that if a person ‘‘had two loaves of bread it would be better to sell one of them to buy white hyacinths to feed the soul.” That was the apt and poetic expression of a truth too frequently neglected. 

Beyond question even the poor need other things more than money. The money may be spent in a short time, but the pleasant memory of a bunch of wild flowers remains with us always. ‘‘Flower missions’’ furnish a beautiful ministry that any Sunday-school, any nature club, can exercise to great advantage for good. It engenders the true spirit of giving with love. By sending your posies to the sick, to the children of the slums, or to those in bonds, you exercise a privilege more potent than the power of gold.
