Country Will RuleDiscussing the liquor question a writer in the Portland Telegram says, that "becausethe saloon cannot be reformed from the inside, and because its menace ·to society is steadily increasing wherever it is allowed to exist, Prohibition sentiment is bound to grow. States which have no cities of half a million population or over will go dry soon, say within four years; some of them in · November next year. It will not be long, at the present rate, before the country districts will vote the big cities dry.''
