SECOND LIBERTY BOND SALE

The second Liberty loan campaign, which has just been launched, is now under full swing, and is being handled in much the same general course as in the first instance.

Undoubtedly there are some of the inmates who would be glad to avail themselves of the opportunity to purchase one or more of these Liberty bonds, as it will evince their approval and support of the principles of our Government.

Further information in this matter can be obtained by applying to our Chaplain, the Rev. Joseph Weleh, who will be pleased to explain in detail the conditions under which the bends are sold. â€” EDITOR.
