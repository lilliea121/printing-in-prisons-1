DIAMOND MINING

In Kimberley, South Africa, the DeBeers Company find it necessary to use the most stringent means to protect their diamonds. When a man goes to work for this company he must sign a contract for four months, and during that time he can not leave the compound except to go to his work. A large per cent of the workmen are Kaffirs, avers the Miner.

The twenty square miles owned by the company are fenced with barbed wire stretching for miles under a tangle of underbrush. If a man attempts to escape, or break in, there is a system of alarm bells which notifies the guard and indicates the exact spot. At night the mines are brilliantly lighted with great electric cres. But in spite of all precautions the DeBeers Company estimated their annual loss into the millions. How the stealing of diamonds is possible where the workmen are so closely watched no one can imagine. In some cases Kaffirs about to leave have been known to tie up a valuable diamond in a rag, and when opportunity offered, would throw it over the barbed wire fence, hoping to find it again when once outside. The guards have several times picked up diamonds done up in this fashion.
