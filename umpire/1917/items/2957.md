TRANSFERRING PHOTOS TO WOOD

A recent issue of the Electrical Experimenter gives the following method of transferring pictures to wood as follows:

Dissolve salt in soft water; float your photo print on the surface, picture side up; let it remain about an hour. The wood should be of birdâ€™s-eye maple or other light-colored hardwood. Varnish with the best copal or transfer varnish.

Take the picture from the water, dry a little between linen rags; then put the engraving, picture side down, on the varnished wood, and smooth it nicely. If the picture entirely covers the wood after the margin is cut off, so that no varnish is exposed, lay over it a thin board and heavy weight; leave it thus over night. If you wish but a small picture in the center of the wood apply the varnish only to a space the size of the picture. Dip your forefinger in salt and water, and commence rubbing off the paper; the nearer you come to the picture the more careful you must be, as a hole would spoil your work.
