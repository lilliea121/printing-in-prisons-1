FINE BAND CONCERT
ON NEW YEAR’S DAY

The afternoon of New Year’s day was the
occasion of a fine concert on the Center, by
the E. S. P. Band, Professor A. F. Wie-
gandt leading with his customary energy and
dash. The program was especially suitable
for the occasion and enlivened the inmates
with its catchy, tuneful numbers.

A large number of visitors were present,
and many expressions of admiration for the
clever work of the musicians were to be
heard. Asone visitor remarked, "This has
been a surprise to me. I never before real-
ized that the prisoners took so much interest
in music."
