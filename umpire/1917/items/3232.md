SING SING CELL-HOUSE RAZED

A New York correspondent writes that with the removal of a stone of Sing Singâ€™s antignated cell block by Governor Charles S. Whitman, during appropriate exercises one day last week, the work of demolishing the historic structure was formally begun.

Sing Sing made the occasion a gala day.

The Mutual Welfare League band turned out to greet the Governor, who was escorted into the prison by the prison officials and sergeant-at-arms of the Mutual Welfare League. Inside the 1200 inmates lined up to receive and salute the Governor, who in return saluted them.

Work of tearing down the old, damp cell block, which houses 1200 convicts, will prog- ress steadily now. It was built in 1815, and for fifty years the State had considered abolishing it.
