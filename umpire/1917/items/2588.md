CHURCH CHOIRS GIVE FINE SONG SERVICE AT E. S. P

The combined choirs of the Church of the Nativity and St. Jude visited this institution on Sunday afternoon last and gave an excellent selection of sacred song for the edification of the inmates.

The choristers have every reason to feel proud of their ability to render high-grade music in a delightful manner, pleasing alike to visitors and to those who appreciate the perfect blending of trained voices in tone harmony and fine tonal quality.

It is to be hoped that we may be favored by another visit of these clever choristers in the near future.
