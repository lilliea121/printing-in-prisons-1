FINE PROGRAM OF SONG BY E. S. P. CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA

An atmosphere of musical charm prevailed on the Center at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, which was due to the excellent song service and orchestral, program of the inmate choir and orchestra under the direction of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, whose ar- rangement of the selections rendered proved most pleasing to the assembled guests and inmates, and they were responsive to the appeal of the music, by numerous encores. Several instrumental solos added to the com- pleteness of the musical miscellany, reflecting credit on the performers.

At the conclusion of the service, Chaplain Joseph Welch addressed the :assembly with a few well chosen remarks, which called out a vociferous applause from all present. The program follows:
