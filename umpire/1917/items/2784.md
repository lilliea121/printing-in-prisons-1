WHAT HAVE WE DONE TODAY?

We shall do so much in the years to come, 
But what have we done today?
We shall give our gold in a princely sum, 
But what did we give today?
We shall lift the heart and dry the tear,
We shall plant a hope in the place of fear,
We shall speak the words of love and cheer, 
What did we speak today?

We shall be so kind in the after-while, 
But what have we been today? 
We shall bring each lonely life a smile, 
But what have we brought today? 
We shall give the truth a greater birth, 
And to steadfast faith a deeper worth, 
We shall feed the hungering souls of earth, 
But whom have we fed today?

We shall reap such joys in the by and bye, 
But what have we sown today?
We shall build us mansions in the sky, 
But what have we built today?
'Tis sweet I idle dreams to bask,
But here and now, do we do our task?
Yes, this is the thing our soul must ask: 
“What have we done today?’’
