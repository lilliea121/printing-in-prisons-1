SONG SERVICE BY INMATE CHOIR AT E. 5. P.

The inmate choir, assisted by E. S. P. or- chestra, gave a fine song service on the Cen- ter, at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, under the able direction of Professor A. F. Wiegandt..

The program consisted of a number of pop- ular and melodious sacred songs and several tuneful orchestral pieces well calculated to please those in attendance and the inmate pop- ulation.

Chaplain Joseph Welch’s short address to the men completed a most pleasurable after- noon of entertainment.
