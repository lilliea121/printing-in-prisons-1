JUDGE CRITICISES NEW METHOD

Our esteemed contemporary, the New Era, published at Leavenworth, Kansas, whose astute editor is ever on the outlook for matter that will make for the welfare and uplift of the imprisoned, quotes a recent statement coming from Judge Paul J. MeCormick, of California, in regard to the parole law, and the indeterminate law as administered in some states, in which the Judge says:

"I am in sympathy with the principal of the indeterminate sentence law, but I am not at all pleased with its working out in some states. It leaves the judicial powers of fixing the extent of the sentence entirely to the governing authority of the penitentiaries; a body that is in no way answerable to the people and which too often is selected on political bases, and has a power which, under the constitution, should be alone vested in the judiciary.

"It offers opvortunities for favoritism, political pulls, and devious methods which are reactionary and not advisable. The controlling commissions are not surrounded by the qualities of a court; there is no necessary publicity; there is no systematic guidance of evidence; there is an absence of everything that makes for justice and right, and a presence of much that often opens the way for "much evil.‚Äù

This keen-minded jurist is well and favorably known on the Pacific coast as a man of high integrity and humane sentiments, and an expression such as the above coming from such an authority will surely receive the attention it justly merits.
