Mrs. Jane Gates, of the Kings Daughters, the Little Mother of the Honor and Friendship Club, attended services at the Episcopal Church held in the Prison Chapel, and was deeply impressed by the evident sincerity of the purpose of the Communicants. She was prevailed upon to sing for the benefit of those present, and choosing one of the older Communion Hymns for her vehicle wrought wonderfully upon the hearts of her hearers, being herself almost overcome by emotion at the moment. The extent and value of this lady’s work among the inmates cannot be measured by earthly standards. We can bow our heads in tribute, and believe with her:

“That men may rise on stepping stones, 
Of their dead selves, to higher things.”
