HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD By Sam Walter Foss

There are hermit souls that live withdrawn,

In the peace of their self-content; v There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart In a fellowless firmament; There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths Where the highways never ran— But let me live by the side of the road, And be a friend to man.

Let me live in a house by the side of the road, Where the race of men go by — The men who are good; and the men who are -bad, As good and as bad as 1. I would not sit in the scorner’s seat, Or hurl the cynic’s ban— ; Let me live in a house by the side of the road, And be a friend to man.

I see from my house by the side of the rosd— By the side of the highway of life, The men who press with ardor of hope, The men who are faint with strife. But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears— Both parts of an Infinite plan— Let me live by the side of the road, And be a friend to man.

I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead, And mountains of wearisome height; And the rowd passes on through the long afternoon, ; And stretches away to the night;

But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice, And weep with the strangers that moan, Let me live in my house by the side of the

road, And be a friend to man.

Let me live in my house by the side of the road, Where the race of men go by—

They are good—they are bad—weak and . strong, : Wise foolish, so am L

Then why should I sit in the scorner’s seat Or hurl the cynic’s ban?

Let me live in my house by the side of the

road, And be a friend to man.
