TRY ONCE AGAIN

Turn ’round; that’s not the way to go; 
The past is dead: tomorrow grow
All opportunity. The fare
To Better-Luck-Land is a dare.
You are not poor so long as will 
Persists within your being still.
With capital of hands and head 
A myriad of men have led
Themselves to fortune. Pluck and pride 
Gave answer when their fellows lied
And told them that their chance had died. 
Try once again—the world is new
Each day. Your chance? Your chance is YOU. 

— Herbert Kaufman.
