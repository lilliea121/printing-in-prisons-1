Governor Paroles Man to Save Homestead

A correspondent states that Henry A. Sei- gler returned to Lawton recently on a sixty- day parole from the Oklahoma Penitentiary where he is serving a life term for murder. Governor Williams granted the parole to give Seigler a chance to provide money to save a Government homestead for his wife and children.
