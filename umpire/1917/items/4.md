E. S. P. GIVES SONG SERVICE ON THE CENTER

The last day of the old year was marked by a well rendered song service on the Center, at this institution, by the inmate choir, ac- companied by the E. S. P. orchestra, under the skilful direction of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt.

The program was selected from the popular sacred songs of the day, and elicited con- siderable praise from those present, espec- ially the baritone solo by B 7962, who pos- sesses a rich baritone voice well above the average singer. B 6252 presided at the piano with consummate skill.

The concluding number of the program was the signal for Chaplain Joseph Welch to ad- dress the assembly in a spirited and able manner on the subject of ‘‘Moral Uplift,’’ which was puncuated by many striking re- marks that found a ready response from his hearers in repeated applause. The Chaplain was followed by Warden R. J. McKenty, who briefly outlined a few of the new bills for the relief of the families of men serving time at penal institutions, which are to be intro- duced at this session of the legislature.
