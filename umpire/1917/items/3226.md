PLUMBAGO MINES

Plumbago, Ceylonâ€™s most important mineral product, is known all over the world for its luster, lubricating, polishing, and binding qualities. In appearance it is a strong black crystalline. There are now about 1000 plumbago mines in Ceylon, including all the shallow pits open works, and deep mines. The depth varies from a few yards to as much as 700 feet. Most of the mines are worked by natives the only important one controlled by Europeans being the Medapola. At the majority of the mines the only machinery used is the dabare. This consists of a long wooden barrel with handles at each end. Round this a rope is given two or three turns, and a bucket is fastened to each end. It is worked by seven or eight men turning the handles.
