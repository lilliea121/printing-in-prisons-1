ASSISTANCE

The Ladies’ Auxiliary began their H. F. C. good work during the week. One of the girls learned that the mother of a 2nd Block member was in needy circumstances. She called a meeting of the ladies’ finance (the First meeting) committee and a collection was taken. The following lady members, B 8233, 8077 and 7857, 50¢; B 8280, 30¢; B 6896, 8312, 8528, 8584, 8435 and 8511, 25¢; B 8654 and 8530, 10¢, contributed their mite. The money, $3.50, was forwarded to the needy family. This is the beginning. The ending is in the future.
