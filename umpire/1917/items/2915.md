A HUMAN SKIN SCREEN

There are many priceless relics in the menage of the Sultan of Turkey, most of which symbolize brutality and vice. But the romance of the famous screen in the throne room of the Sultan’s palace is worth repeating.

It is made, so rumor hath it, of human skin, perfectly tanned and elaborately tooled and embossed, and it has been in the royal quarters for more than two centuries. This remarkable screen is not an evidence of cruelty or barbarity on the part of Turkey’s ruler 200 years ago, but is a memorial to twelve faithful servants of a former Sultan.

At one time during the Sultan’s reign, two hundred years ago, a wing of the palace caught fire, and during the conflagration a much-loved member of the Sultan’s family was rescued by twelve servants. The twelve servants perished, some of them dying later of their wounds and burns, so his Majesty had their skins removed by an expert and had them preserved in this touching though remarkable manner. The screen is now looked upon as a part of the ruler’s inheritance, and it is said that every Sultan cherishes it as a mascot.
