What Sort of Friend Are You?What sort of a friend are you?Do you stick by a brother's side,As you know you'd want him to do If you were as sternly tried?Is there ever a pleasure rare That you willingly go withoutTo share another's care,And smilingly help him out?What sort of a friend are you? Just one of the fair kind?A smile when the skies are blue, Ahead when he falls behind?Do you put yourself out at all,Do you pass up a joy that's nighTo answer a brother ' s call, Or selfishly hurry by?Do you stick when his days are glum, As you did when his days were fair?When he wishes that you would come, Do you eagerly hurry there?Or do you think of yourselfEach minute the whole day through,Of comfort, of fame and pelf? What sort of a friend were you? -Exchange.
