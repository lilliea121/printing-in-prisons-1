PATRIOTIC ADVICE

Don’t get in heated arguments.

Don’t keep asking the orchestra to play “Star Spangled Banner.” If you feel that way about it, go up and enlist as soon as the Board of Pardons grants your application.

Don’t try to explain what the President should have done. Cheer what he is doing.

Don’t peddle rumors! Make at least a little effort to ascertain what truth there is in a story before you repeat it.

Rumors incite disorder and excite people!

In short, keep your shirt on!
