Try Deep Breathing Deep breathing, sensible breathing, everyday breathing-long life depends upon it, good looks always. Yet nine-tenths of the world's creatures hate to breathe, and young folks especially are as niggardly in the matter of filling their lungs with clean, wholesome air as if they thought they were dealing with poison. Twenty long breaths night and morning will quickly improve the looks of a girl who has begun to go down with study and carelessness, and surely there is no beautifier cheaper than deep breathing.
