THE SUNNY SIDE

There’s a custom I admire, 
It’s a strictly rural one, 
Jest the plain ol’ country custom 
Of a stayin’ in the sun. 
W’y our visitin’ in winter, 
When the neighbor men drop in, 
Is a-mostly in the sunshine 
On the south side of the bin.

On the south side of a buildin’ 
Some’rs ’bout the dear old farm 
You can find us, talkin’, laughin’ 
Where the sun is bright and warm; 
And our hearts are warmer, gladder, 
For the friendly tales we spin, 
When we visit in the sunshine 
On the south side of the bin.

Trouble clouds can’t stand the sunshine, 
Worry has to beat it, too,
When you let a little sunlight 
Filter round the heart of you,
And there ain’t no sweeter sunshine 
Ever fell across the day
Then you’ll find about a farmyard 
In the winter time, I say!

So, when days are dark and dreary, 
And old Trouble’s hangin’ ’round, 
H’ist your head up in the sunshine, 
Plant your feet square on the ground, 
And jest git out in the open, 
Where the farmyard echoes blend, 
On the south side of your troubles, 
Where the sunshine is, my friend!
