OBITUARY
Two more of the members of the Honor and Friendship Club died during the week jast past, and the expense of their burial was accepted by the Club. These expenses are necessary, and one of the sources of satisfaction. It is a fact, however, that they draw heavy on the Treasury, and a request to each and every member for acontribution, be it a dollar or a dime, to meet this and other expenses is sufficient.

Give your number to the Representative Delegate, and the amount you wish to con- tribute. It’s a donation well made. i
