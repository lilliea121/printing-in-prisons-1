FRIGHTFUL WEAPONS

The weapon common to every part of Hin- dustan, so as to deserve the name of the national arm, is the ‘‘katar.” This is a broad, two-edged dagger, the hilt of which is formed something like an H. the hand grasping the crossbar, which is generally double, while the side bars extend on each side of the wrist.

Some katars are made with five blades which unite into one, but by squeezing together the crossbars the blades diverge like the fingersof a hand when the thrust has been given. Other katars are made in sets of two or even three, of diminishing sizes, the blades of the larger being hollow and forming sheathes for the smaller.

Some of the southern Indian katars, known as ‘‘death givers,” are immense weapons, nearly two feetlong in the blade, and the hilts are a mass of fantastic scrollwork and mythological monsters, the cobra with ex- panded hood figuring largely.

There are also the ‘‘bich’hwa,’’ or scorpion’s sting, a doubly curved dagger; the ‘‘khanjar,” a larger form of the same, and the ‘‘peshkabz,’’ or hunting knife. But none of these elaborate weapons has about it the terribly ‘‘businesslike’’ look of the Khybet knife (“ch’hura,’’) with its ponderous single edged, tapering blade and plain ivory hilt.
