OFF FOR SERVICE IN FRANCE

Two of this institution’s most popular and efficient officers, Frank Tees and Frank Tucker, who volunteered for active service in the Ambulance Corps, prior to registration, have left here for the Allentown, Pa., cantonment to undergo a six-weeks’ course of instruction preparatory work prior to embarkation for France, where it is expected they will be immediately sent forward to the firing line for service with the U. S. forces. The ambulance service back of the firing line is of a particularly hazardous nature and the mortality has been very high in the present European war.

It is very much to the credit of these worthy young men that they chose that branch of the service where the danger is greatest ard the chances for adequate reward for valiant service are of the least.

Messrs. Tees and Tucker bid a host of friends good-by yesterday before leaving Philadelphia, while all joined in wishing them safe return from the path of perilous duty.
