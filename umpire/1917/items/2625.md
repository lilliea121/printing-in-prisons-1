A DEATH LURE According to tradition, Kenith, the legendary king of Scotland, was allured to his death in a most novel manner." Kenith had slain a son and brother of Fennella, who to be avenged ordered Wiltus, a famous silver-_ smith, to construct a death-dealing statue of silver. In its right hand the statue held a basin and in the left hand an apple of pure gold, both set with diamonds and other precious stones. â€˜To touch the apple was to defy death, it being so arranged that any one guilty of such vandalism would be immediately riddled by poisoned arrows shot from openings in the body of the statue. Kenith was invited to inspect the wonder, and, as Fennella had hoped, he tried to pluck the precious imitation fruit. When his hand touched the apple he was wounded by the arrows and died as he fell.
