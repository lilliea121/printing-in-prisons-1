The Jumping CocoonA noted traveler who recently returned from an extensive trip through South and Central America, tells how many visitors to the southwestern states / and Mexico have amused themselves by watching the queer motions of "jumping beans," the seed vessels of a plant, each of which contain the pupa of an insect whose spasmodic movements cause the bean to hop and roll about.More remarkable are the "jumping cocoons" found in South Africa. The cocoon is formed by the mother insect and is very hard. The pupa when ready to emerge must cut its way out. The front of its head has a sharp, chisel-like edge, and by driving this against the inside of the shell it gradually makes a hole. The violent motions of the pupa within cause the cocoon to leap so that one has been seen to spring out of a small glass tumbler.
