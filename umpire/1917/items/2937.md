LOCAL OPTION IN RED RIVER DISTRICT

The Red River of the North, which has long been the division line between ‘‘wet’ territory in Minnesota and ‘‘dry’’ in Dakota, is gradually losing that distinction as one after another the counties of the former state vote out the saloon under local option. Moorhead, Minn., opposite Fargo, N.D., closed its emporiums some months ago, and now East Grand Forks, across the river from Grand Forks, N. D., has taken similar action.
