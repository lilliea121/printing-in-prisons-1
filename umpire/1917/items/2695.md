INMATE CHOIR GIVES SUNDAY SONG SERVICE

The inmate choir assisted by the E. S. P. orchestra gave an unusually well rendered song service on the Center at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, under the capable direction of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt. In addition to the clever singing of the choristers the service was featured with an instrumental solo, and the fine baritone rendition of "The End of a Perfect Day,‚Äù by B 7962. The program was happily selected to meet the varied tastes of the assembled guests and the inmates, and the numbers were heartily encored.
