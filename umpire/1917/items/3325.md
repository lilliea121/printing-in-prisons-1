SKYSCRAPERS

There are several ‘‘skyscrapers" in Westminster which challenge comparison with the stately towers of the Houses of Parliament. The newest tower—that of the Middlesex Guildhall—is 110 feet in height, or more than 100 feet lower than the dome of the Wesleyan Central Hall, the summit of which is 212 feet above the ground floor. Almost facing these two buildings the two towers of Westminster Abbey rise 225 feet, while the great campanile of the Roman Catholic Cathedral, off Victoria street, rears itself 60 feet higher than the Abbey towers.

The clock tower and the Victoria tower of the Houses of Parliament, however, are still easily supreme, the former boasting a height of 316 feet and the latter—the most stupendous tower, as distinguished from spires in the world—being 75 feet square, 345 feet high, or, to the top of the vane, 420 feet, 55 feet higher than the cross which crowns the dome of St. Paul’s.
