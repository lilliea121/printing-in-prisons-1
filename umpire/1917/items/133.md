THE FOLLY OF CRIME 

Crime is beyond the least lucrative occupa- tion. To begin with, stolen gcods can only be sold in certain markets. The ‘‘fence’’ naturally takes advantage of circumstances and pays a ridiculous fraction of actual val-

ue. When years of penal servitude are consid-

. ered and the sum total of earnings during

such periods added to these precarious glean- ings, the average income from a criminal ca- reer is less than that from the lowest form of menial labor.

In brief, crooks work harder, get less out of life, undergo more suffering and depriva- tion than any other class of people. :

No thief ever continued his calling and died in comfort. The most notorious felons spent their last days in outrageous poverty.

Nobody can accomplish much with his hands tied. Wrong is such a handicap and offers so few opportunities that native abil- ity, however remarkable, is shackled and discounted by knavery.

It stands to reason that an individual can go farther with the good-will of the com- munity than with its opposition.
