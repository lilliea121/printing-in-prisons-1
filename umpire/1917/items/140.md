HISTORIC PAWNEE ROCK

Perhaps it may interest some- of the read- ers of THE UMPIRE to learn that a short dis- tance from Pawnee Rock Station, Kansas, is a high southward facing cliff of sandstone known as Pawnee Rock, projecting as a rocky promontory from the broad ridge that forms the north side-of the valley. The ele- ments and the hand of man, according to lo- cal report, have made great changes in its size and appearance since the days when the Santa Fe trail passed along its base. ‘Her'e there were many encounters between the savages and the whites, and also between hostile bands of Indians; for the place is not- ed not only in pioneer history but in Indian traditions as well. Names and initials of many travelers, from the early trappers and the ‘‘forty-niners’’ to the later army de- tachments, have been scratched on the smooth faces of the ledges.
