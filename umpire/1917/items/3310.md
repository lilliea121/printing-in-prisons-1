KNIGHTS COLLECT FUNDS

The Knights of Columbus drive for funds for war camp work met with deserved success at the mass meeting in the Grand Opera House on Sunday afternoon.

This endeavor is but one of many efforts throughout the country to raise the Knights of Columbus ecamp fund to $5,000,000.

It is expected that a much larger sum will be required to provide for the comforts and assistance of the soldiers.
