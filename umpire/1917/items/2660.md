EGGS STERILIZED BY GAS

A method of preserving eggs which is said to keep them absolutely fresh for an indefinite length of time is in use in France. New laid eggs in tin cases holding 1,000 each are placed in an autoclave, from which the air is exhausted until all the gas within the shells has been drawn out. Then carbonic acid gas and nitrogen are introduced from tanks of these gases in liquid form, and the tins containing the eggs are sealed with solder. Any germs of decay are killed by these gases, and it is said that the flavor of the eggs is in no way affected.
