NOTICE

We regret to announce that the Librarian of the Club has resigned, causing a reorganizing of the magazine circulating de partment. B 8334 and B 7364 have been appointed librarians and will have full charge of the same. Both are experienced in magazines and periodicals and will be pleased to give any information desired regarding the Clubâ€™s methods. This is a splendid opportunity to secure good fresh reading at a very small cost and assist the Club with your subscriptions.

B 7542, Secretary.
