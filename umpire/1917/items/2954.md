OUR RESPECTABLE CITIZENS

A writer in the Worth While Magazine avers that it may not be far out of the way to predict that before the war with Germany ends, a number of our so-called ‘‘respectable citizens’’ will be looking through the bars of a prison cell from within. 

“And it won’t be for ordinary treason, either,” says the writer. ‘‘It won’t be for giving aid and comfort to the enemy, but for wilful, brutal injury to their own countrymen.

“The man who, for the sake of personal | gain, will see the poorin want and children hungry, has no place even in hell, with a traitor. The man who will take advantage of the poor in time of stress or war and by adulterating food, manipulating prices and speculating in food and other necessities, so as to create a shortage that causes distress and suffering, is the worst kind of a criminal in or out of jail. 'It is an ill wind that blows nobody good,' and out of this world war, even, many good things will come and one of them will be the ability of the American people to take care of themselves.’’
