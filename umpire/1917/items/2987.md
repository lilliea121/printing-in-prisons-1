SPECIAL SERVICE OF MUSIC AND SONG FOR INMATES

A special service of sacred song and select music was provided for the inmates of this institution by Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, on Sunday afterncon last, the E. S. P. choir and orchestra rendering the various numbers with such consummate skill that unstinted praise was to be heard from all in attendance at the musical medley. Particular mention of Master Wiegandt’s showing of techniqe at the piano is fully justified by his clever performance.

The program was as follows:
