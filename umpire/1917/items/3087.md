IRON IN USE OVER 5,000 YEARS

The best infomed sources give the period from 2000 to 2500 B. C. as marking the transition from bronze to iron. Professor J. B. Wilson, in a recent article in the Princeton Theological Review, presents pretty nearly all of the available evidence on the subject.

The “iron age’’ seems to have begun earliest in Asia Minor, where iron was used for various purposes as early as 2500 B. C.

The people of Nipur used iron knives and arrowheads as early as 2000 B. C; and iron is claimed to have been used in Babylon five centuries earlier. India is known to have had iron abundance in 1500 B. C; and the Chinese ‘‘Annals’’ mention it as having been in use there in 2940 B. C; or nearly 5,000 years ago.
