Despots of DemocracyTimorous legislators and "pussy-footed" executives yield to the threatening demands of organized busybodies, and occasionally an inspired ass with a certificate of election in his pocket originates vexatious legislation. But the annoyance comes principally born unofficial busybodies who promote legislation designed to make the common herd conform to their ideas. * * * * * The necessarynumber of public servants is swollen by swarms of official parasites, who are taken away from the producing class and who find in oppression a justification of their continuance on the public salary roll. It is time to call a halt. N. Y. Herald.
