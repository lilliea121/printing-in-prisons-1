ST. JOHN’S ASYLUM BOYS REGALE E. S. P. INMATES WITH SONG

St. John’s Asylum boys visited this institution on Sunday last and entertained the inmates with a splendid selection of song. The entertainment was arranged under the auspices of the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, and proved highly pleasing to all in attendance. It was most refreshing to hear the sweet voices of the youthful singers who were under the able direction of Prof. Alfons Heuermann. The program was as follows:
