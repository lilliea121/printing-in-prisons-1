WOULD TRAIN HOBOES

An exchange says that J. A. Gray, of New York, formerly of the University of Minnesota, declares that hoboes cught to be registered and put into training so that they would amount to something to the country. ‘‘There are millions of hoboes in the country,” he said, ‘‘thousands of whom are of the draft age and who would profit from military train- ing. Round them up each year, train those who are fit and put the others to work in va- rious institutions and keep them under supervision for at least three years.
