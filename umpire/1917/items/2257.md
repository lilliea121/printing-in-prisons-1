The Most Used LibraryClose after the discovery that New York is the greatest city in the world comes the report that its public library is the most used library on earth. Its daily average number of readers is double that of the British Museum of London or the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris, according to the report for 1915, just published, which says that 10,384,579 books were borrowed in the year and that 2,558,7l7 persons entered the central buildingat Fifth avenue and Forty-second street. The war has brought a great increase in the number of people who use the library for research. It has become, the director says, an immense laboratory for scientific investigation, particularly to those seeking information regarding new industries.
