EPISCOPAL SERVICE

Thursday, Nov. 15tn, services were held in the Chapel by the Episcopal Church at this institution under the charge of the Rev. Dr. Hutchinson, rector of St. Clemont’s Episcopal Church, this city.

Mass was celebrated by Father Hutchinson assisted by a deacon of his parish.

Prior to celebration of Holy Communfon, Dr. Hutchinson delivered a discourse on the subject of, ‘“The Sacredness of these Sacraments.”

In sequence to the discource the congregation was honored with a mezzo-soprano solo, entitled:— "I Come to Thee,” words by George Graff Jr., music composition by Caro Roma, sung by Mrs. Gates.

The Choir, under the efficient leadership of B 7737 proved to be in excellent shape, and its chants of praise sounded melodiously throughout the Chapel.

In the afternoon, Dr. Hutchinson gave particularly for the benefit of those who are to receive the Holy Rites of Confirmation, an interesting and instructive talk upon the “Doctrine of the Church," and his competency as a lecturer and perspicuity enabled all to grasp with ease the lesson which was being expounded to them.
