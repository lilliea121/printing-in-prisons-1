Sage LeavesPunishment is said to be the fruit that unsuspected ripens within the flower of pleasure which conceals it.***If you attempt to put a chain around theneck of another, be assured that the other end will fasten itself around your own.He who treats men as mere pawns and checkers, will some day suffer as well as they.***For all the benefits we receive we mustrender again, deed for deed, dollar for dollar, to somebody.***Objections and criticisms are the stumbling-blocks for the weak and the delight of the censorious-minded. So much of our time is spent in preparation and routine, that the pith of each man's genius contracts itself into a very few hours.
