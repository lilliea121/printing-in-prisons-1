HONOR CLUB NOTES

The beginning of the celebration of the Second Anniversary of the H. F. C. was made a festive occasion on Saturday. )

The band, under Professor Wiegandt’s able leadership, had the opportunity to try out their new instruments.

The parade was formed in front of the amusement hall, and promptly at 12:45, the band leading and playing a joy-inspiring march, the word was given to the Vice-Pres- ident (A 8432) and the parade started.

Immediately following tbe band, in the place of honor, came the charter members, with the organizer (B 5888) leading; then followed the respective blocks, marshalled by their respective delegates. A brave showing and one to verify Bobby Burns’ ‘A man’s a man for a’ that.”” Around the institution, to finally defile into twos and, quietly and order- ly, marched up the steps and into the amuse- ment hall, to be greeted with a processional from the H. F. C. orchestra, fitting music to the hall, decorated for the occasion with flags, bunting, electric lights of many col- ors, and the Club’s colors, tastefully distrib- uted throughout the hall. This work, by B 7648, assisted by B 7849, was well done.

During an intermission the Vice-President, (A 8432) introduced the President, who spcke. a few words of interest and then introduced B 5888, ‘‘to whom,’’ to quote the President, ‘““the Club owes everything, for, from his mind came the idea of the H. F. C.”” B 5888 then addressed the members with a few appropriate remarks, among which, he said, “‘his heart, and every interest, was for the Club’s welfare.’”” . His words. were received with hearty applause, which lasted urtil he had resumed his seat. After quiet had been restored the show was on. The H. F. C. or- chestra, under Professor Wiegandt, rencered an overture; then came the 'Iriangle fine arts picture, ‘‘Double Trouble,”’ with -Doug- las Fairbanks the feature. It was a fine picture, in six reels, and was given hearty applause. :

The vaudeville opened with a violin solo- ist, who was given a hearty reception.

Then came ‘“The Musleal Seminoles,’” who richly deserved all the applause they receiv- ed. Their work was very good, and the house simply went wild over them. The In- dian costume and their original acting were fine. 3

(Continued from page 1.) team, came next. Their yoddling and clever sketch was well - received and loudly ap- plauded.

Franklin and Bergman, with a comedy sketch, appealed to the audience. In the opening many were fooled when Bergman came on and apparently sang a song in a fe- male voice. Mr. Kraupa pulled aside the curtains, revealing Miss Franklin, who had been singing under cover. Then followed a sketch in comedy that every one enjoyed and applauded to the echo. '

A high-class dress comedy sketch wound up the performance. It was like getting a letter from home to see Coster and Kane. There were some there who know the team. especially Mr. Kane, and would have been well pleased to have said ‘‘HHow-de.”” The audience united in voicing ‘‘good’’, and Cos- ter and Kane retained their reputation for good-fellowship by remaining every minute they could.

“Fatty’”” Arbuckle in ““The Other Man”’ was the rib-tickler to send the audience home (?) in a good humor, satisfied that ev- erything possible had been done for their en- tertainment, and they had done their little ‘“‘bit’’ to make things agreeable.

A special mention should- be given to a work of art, a large fac-simile of an H. F. C. button in white and gold, the letters H. F. C. blazed forth in electricity, and the effect was splendid. The idea was conceived and the button made by B 8361. It was in- tended as a surprise for President McKenty and Vice-President A 8432, and was very fine. The Warden was with us and was well pleased. He had as his guests members of ~ the staff of the Pennsylvania Hospital, Dr. J. Walter Levering, Chief Resident Physic- ian, and Drs. F. F. Lane, John Connelly, Harold Kinderman, Robert: McKiver. They voiced the remark of Dr. Levering, ‘“We have had a good time.”’ v

Miss Elsie McKenty graced the Club with her presence. ‘‘Bill’’ was there; his mind is on spring training now and he’s thinking of Southern skies and camp. Charlie (B 6252) looked over toward the drum. He found Sam and immediately began to play. Miss Mae Russell had as her guest Mrs. Cross, theatrical booking agent and wife of the publisher of the Vaudeville Times.

Mr. Kraupa was pleased with himself and congratulated Jimmy (The Man in the Box) and ‘‘Doc Bird’’ on their work of tcday. He could not har.dle hot potatoes though, so left hot-handed.

Herbert says he has a ‘‘gun,’’ but we think it’s loaded with pleasant smiles.

The President, R. C. McKenty, stated from

the stage that ‘“The Warden had not had one complaint against an H. F. C. member since the entertainments had been started.’” - This is some record. . :

Mr. Collins took off his official robes and came to the show just to have a good time; and he did.

Next week will wind up the anniversary when the 2nd Section will have their outing, Jan. 13th, 1917.

The Vice-President (A 8432) thanks the members for the good conduct maintained for the past year. The influence of the Honor and Friendship Club is felt in that the Administration report shows that there has been less infraction of the rules, therefore less cause for punishment, since the organi- zation of the H. F. C. than has ever been known before, either in this or other institu- tions. This is directly credited to the Honor and Friendship Club. :

Let the motto for the coming year be ‘“‘give and take.”” Avoid quarrels and their conse- quences. KEach man endeavors to make the condition of the other fellow a little brighter each day. As long as you are square and on the level the officers of the Club are beck of you. As long as the officers are square and on the level the Administration is back of them. One for all, all for one. Good luck for 1917. _ Vice-Pres’t, A 3432: Sec’y, B 7562.

With the ending of the year 1916 the Of- ficers, Delegates and Members of the Honor and Friendship Club can look back on a year of achievement of which they may well be proud. :

Not only have they proved themselves worthy of the consideration and confidence of their friends and well-wishers, but by their appreciation of the privileges granted them, the cause of the prisoner throughout the country has been advanced to that position that it must go forward, and as the confi- dence is proven, so will greater privileges be extended. At all times the conduct of each member is under close observation; he-is vir- tually in the lime-light. Individually and collectively, he is judged—one is valueless without the whole; the whole is weakened by loss of one. - 3

The pride of each member of the Honor and Friendship Club is not one jot less than the satisfaction of the Warden and of those who have the power and extend the privilege that permits the advancement of the condi- tion of men who heretofore have been consid- ered fit only for the discard. It is the record of ths past year that the Honor and Friend- ship Club can refer to, that will go far to indicate that, although removed from the outer world, we retain our individuality and are a human thinking and able link in the great human chain.

This record is from May 3rd, 1916, to Jan., T
