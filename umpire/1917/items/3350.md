MUST WORK OR JOIN ARMY

Work six days a week and support the family, or join the army.

Such was the ultimatum delivered by Pennsylvania’s committee of public safety, which has recommended that a minor, exempted because of his occupation, who worked only four days a week, be made eligible for draft service again. His exemption has been withdrawn, and in a statement issued recently by the committee it is said that this action has had a salutary effect on several other cases.

The man was granted exemption because of his plea of ‘‘married responsibilities,'’ supplemented by an occupational claim. Then he refused to work more than four days a week, and after warning defied the committee.
