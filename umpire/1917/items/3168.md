ENTERTAINMENT OF MUSIC AND SONG BY ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR

Patriotic airs and sacred songs abounded in the program rendered by the E. S. P. orchestraand inmate choir on the Center, at this institution on Sunday last.

The numbers were happily selected to please and inspire the visitors and inmates and was received with repeated encores.

Professor A. F. Wiegandt, as conductor, yielded the baton with becoming grace, holding the musicians and choristers under perfect control, and clearly showing the fine results of his careful drilling.

A pleasing address by Chaplain Joseph Welch followed the conclusion of the program, which was as follows:
