OUT OF THE SILENCE

And what can you say when the day is done 
And you’ve gone to your bed of rest? 
When the shadows come and the light has gone 
O’er the rim of the golden west, 
And a silvery beam of the moon creeps in 
As if in aimless quest?— What do you say 
When a kindly voice that you seem to know, 
Out of the shadows speaks soft and low, 
“Well, what did you do today?’’

O, what can you say when you’re all alone 
With the master of all the task?— 
How much of sin do you have to own 
When the voice of the master asks?— 
How many things that you left undone 
Your studied answer make? What do you say 
When out of the shades of the silent night 
The Master speaks with the Master’s right: 
“Well, what did you do today?”’

Thrice blest is he of the humble way 
Who sinks to his bed of rest— 
The rest he earned with a toiling day 
With love of his labor blest— 
Who hears the voice of his Master ask 
And can truthfully say ‘‘My best!” 
The man who can say 
“I’ve trod the way of my best intend, 
I've helped a friend and I’ve made a friend” 
To “What did you do today?
