A MUCH NEEDED MEASURE

It has been definitely announced that Judges Martin and Bregy, of the Common Pleas Court, have drafted a bill to be presented to the next Legislature authorizing the cities of the first class to make appropriations for a fund to be used under the direction of the Quarter Sessions Court for needy priscners at liberty on probation. E. M. Hackney, probation officer of the Quarter Sessions tribunal, brought the matter to the attention of the Judges.

It is understood that the plan is not to make an outright gift of any money, but rather in the way of a loan for immediate purposes, so that it can be paid back when the probationer obtains work.

As the state law now stands, a prisoner is given five dollars on his release; a sum barely sufficient for two dayâ€™s lodging in these days of high prices.
