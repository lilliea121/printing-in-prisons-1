E.S.P. Choir Hold Song Service on CenterThe monthly song service of the E. S. P. choir was held on the Center at this institution on Sunday afternoon last. The program as arranged by Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, consisted of several numbers of sacred song selections from the popular hymns of the day, which proved entertaining to the inmates and visitors. The choristers did well in song and they were ably supplemented by the even playing of the orchestra. The program is given below.PROGRAM1.
