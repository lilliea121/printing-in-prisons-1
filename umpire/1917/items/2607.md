OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE HoNoRr AND FrIENDSHIP CLUB OF THE E. S. P., 21ST AND FAIRMOUNT AVENUE.

GENTLEMEN:

I can poorly express in these few lines my heartfelt appreciation to you all in your expression of love and genuine friendship in sending your beautiful gift to my husband.

Before his illness I know his pleasure was to be with you in the Trade School and talking with the boys.

The floral-piece was the most beautiful I have ever seen, and it is with him in the churchyard at Mount Holly, N. J.

My son and daughter join with me in love and sincere thanks to you all.

EMILY MUNROE DOBBINS. 
1811 Arch Street, April 10, 1917.
