MY PENKNIFE* By B 8244 Only a little penknife, A delicate, dainty thing! But it means to me a ray of hope, And it makes my glad heart sing;— O life's wasted years and bitter tears! They recall the days of youth, When I trod the ways that lead to death, The ways that know not truth. Only a little penknife, With a delicate handle of pearl! The gift to me from the fair hand Of all that is best in a girl;— O angels of mercy in Heaven, Look down today from the skies, Make me love her whom God gave me, Keep her image before my eyes. Only a little penknife, With two tiny blades of steel!— Cut from my heart all guilt and sin As on bended knees I kneel;— And O God, in Thy infinite mercy, Take Thou my wasted life, Teach me to love with all my heart The woman who is my wife. * A lady recently paid a visit to her husband, who is serving a short term in the Eastern State Penitentiary. Her parting gift was a tiny pearl handled penknife.
