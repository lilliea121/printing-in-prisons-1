Wonderful Hand-Weaving in MexicoThose who have traveled through Mexico tell of the wonderful hand-woven blankets made by the Indian girls of Mexico, to whom a dime a day is a good wage, although they begin work at sunrise and labor until sunset. They are the admiration and despair of all who appreciate fine handiwork or value perfect color combinations. A small blanket bought in Mexico City five years ago, although it has been used as a wall tapestry ever since, seems as bright in every one of its rainbow colors as on the day it was bought. The weaving is so perfect that it has no right or wrong side.
