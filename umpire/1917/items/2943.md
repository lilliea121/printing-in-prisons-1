Wm. Webber.

Dear Friend Pete:—Just a line to you and all of the boys of the H. F. C. 

I am doing well and can truly say that I think that every man that makes up his mind to do right need have no trouble in getting along. There is plenty of work and good wages to be had; so no one need feel discouraged. If you personally know of one or two good men who know anything of the line of business that I am in (waiter), let me know, and perhaps I can place them. I am captain of this Club—over the waiters—and a word from me would go towards securing a place for a man—pantryman, buss boys and waiters.

Please tell the officers and delegates that I send my regards, hoping that I may soon see you and many others.

Remember me to Mr. Reuben McKenty, Chaplain and all.

Sincerely yours,

July 31, 1917. H. Ed. Percival.
