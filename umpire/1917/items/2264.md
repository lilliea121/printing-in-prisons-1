Going the RoundsThe cooler has been pretty well patronized so far this year. This is rather hard on stock exchange members.We are still living in hopes of the ten to fifty cents per diem schedule being carried into effect. "Good things come s-1-o-w;" especially in a penitentiary.There seems to be much talk on the outside at present about new legislation bearing on the betterment of prison conditions, food, etc. Let us hope it is not all smoke.It i::; rumored that a mutual reserve bank is to be opened when work becomes plentiful hereabout . It's a good idea and will obviate the necessity of using tin cans or old socks as temporary repositories.How many New Year resolutions still stick? One man of the 7th Block who had sworn off on half rations of beans and pot-pie has fallen from grace, and is again in line for three pans of 'beans and two pieces of p. r More power to him.The State Attorney-General's decision on back time cases has come as a source of surprise to many of our inmates, but we hope they will not consider it too seriously. Remember it is always darkest before dawn, and perhaps the present legislature may do something to brighten up matters '0r those affected.
