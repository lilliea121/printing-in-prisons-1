NOT OURS UNTIL WE LIVE IT

The truth which another man has won from nature or from life is not our truth until we have lived it. Only that becomes real or helpful to any man which has cost the sweat of his brow,the effort of his brain, or the anguish of his soul. He who would be wise must daily earn his wisdom.

â€”David Starr Jordan.
