“KEEP ON KEEPING ON”

What shall a man do when faith seems to fail and hope dies and final failure seems to soak in like an impenetrable cloud? Keep straight on. It is the moment of supreme evil, for, according to the old fable, the devil’s best weapon is despair. It is the supreme test of character, the moment which shows whether faith has been a matter of sunshine, of prosperity, of happiness, or has become an unshakable foundation, on which rest the hopes, the performances, the strength of a man’s soul. Has he the vitality of conviction and the immovable loyalty to stand when all help seems to fail him? That hour is the supreme test of the man. . . .When Cavour, broken-hearted by failure in his ardent dream of a united Italy, was on the verge of suicide, success was already in his hands; and it was during that tragic winter when Washington’s troops, ragged, half-fed, seemed like the ghost of a lost cause, that a compact and effective army was created for him.
