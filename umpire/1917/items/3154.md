SEWING WITHOUT THREAD.

A prominent writer says thathe overheard a little girl declare that she liked to sew when there was no thread in the machine, because it ran so easily.

A good many people, I think, are pretty fond of running their machines without thread.

When I hear a boy talking largely of the grand things he would do, if only he could, and if only things and circumstances were different, and then neglecting every daily duty, and avoiding work and lessons, I think he is running his machine withoutany thread.

When I see a girl very sweet and pleasant abroad, ready to do anything for a stranger, and cross and disagreeable in her home, she, too, is running her machine without any thread.

Ah! This sewing without a thread is easy indeed, and the life machine will make a great buzzing, but labor, time and force will, in the end, be far worse than lost.
