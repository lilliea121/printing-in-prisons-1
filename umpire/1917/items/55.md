Shoes Too Dear; Will Wear Sandals

Footwear styles of ancient Greece may be- come the fashion in Burlicgton counâ€™y next summer, as granges and farm clubs are dis- cussing the increasing price of shoes, and shoe dealers have been asked to ascertain the cost of sandals. The sandal can be worn without hosiery and effect a further saving. Advocacy of the idea is not confined to the sterner sex.
