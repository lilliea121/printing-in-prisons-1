New Use for Patrol Wagon

““Mooing’’ at her captors, a Jérsey cow was recently noticed by cnlookers as she rode in the patrol wagon of the Eleventh District, East Girard Avenue, clackety-bang through the streets. The cow was locked up and is being held for an owner. She was discovered through a phone call to the station, at Grom- ley’s wharf, Beach Street below East Colum- bia Avenue, which said a ‘‘wild animal’’ was prowling around in that vicinity.
