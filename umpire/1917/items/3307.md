TO BE THE “CLYDE OF AMERICA”

Philadelphia will soon be the center of the ship-building industry of the United States, said Walter Goodenough, general manager of the American International Corporation, recently. The plant is located on Hog Island near this city, and the management is now seeking a large number of men to fill positions at the works.

Mr. Goodenough gave a detailed description of the work at Hog Island, showing how well adapted it is to ship-building. He spoke of the school that is to be opened there next week, under the direction of the Williamson Trade School, for the purpose of instructing men in mechanical work. Concluding his remarks he said that after the war comparisions with shipyards of other countries may show those of Philadelphia to be the largest in the world. Let us see that our river is not termed the “Clyde of America,’’ but the “Delware of the United States.”

And remember that a boost for ships is a boost for Philadelphia.’’
