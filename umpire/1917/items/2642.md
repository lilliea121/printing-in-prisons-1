LIFE AND THE WEAVER

Life is a woven fabric; 
The pattern and web are wrought 
By the dark threads and the golden 
That into the loom are shot.

You can not judge God’s purpose 
By the thrust of a single thread, 
What to you may be dark, mysterious, 
May be gloriously bright instead.

For he holds in mind a pattern 
As fair as his love is strong,
Which grows each day in the weaving; 
Not a single thread goes wrong.

No warp in his hands shall tangle, 
No slumber his eyelids close,
We only can thwart his purpose
When our stubborn wills impose

Our tangled and broken efforts 
To walk in his kind commands
Will give life an added luster 
Restored by his loving hands.

So trust in the Weaver’s wisdom, 
In his love and unfailing care,
And the fabric of life completed 
Some day will be wondrous fair. 

—A. W. Dewar.
