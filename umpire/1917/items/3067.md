SONG SERVICE GIVEN BY E. S. P. CHOIR

The Sunday afternoon song service on the Center at this institution by the E. S. P. Choir, with orchestra accompaniment, proved a gratifying musical event to those in at- tendance, as well as to the inmates.

A select miscellany of sacred song and classic music was provided for the occasion by Prof. A. F. Wiegandt, who has the inmate choir in charge.

The choristers were in good voice and made a most favorable impression on the visiting guests assembled to hear their rendition of the selections.

The program was as follows:
