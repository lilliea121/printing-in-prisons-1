THE SILVER DOLLAR

Although the silver doller is almost daily increasing in intrinsic value, the policy of holding it in the vaults and permitting it to be represented in circulation by a paper silver certificate is to be continued. Throughout the greater part of the United States the silver dollar is almost a curiosity. Notso in the Missouri Valley, however, where one is likely. at any time, to be handed three or four in the breaking of a $5 bill. Nobody has thus far explained why the silver dollar should cling to circulation in this particular quarter, but travelers from other sections as a rule, are glad it does.
