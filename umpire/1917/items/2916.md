PUNISHMENT TO FIT CRIME

An English author states that new uses are being found for the phonograph. One of the latest of these, as tried in a Western city of the United States, is the employment of the phonograph to teach singing. A record is made of the pupilâ€™s interpretation of some song, and he is then permitted to hear himself sing it, the theory being, of course, that he will thus be able to judge his effort more accurately.

In time perhaps the custom will become so general that all singers will try their songs on themselves before they try them before audi- ences, and this, it must be admitted, would be an arrangement which many audiences would greatly appreciate.
