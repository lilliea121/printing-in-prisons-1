LINCOLN’S BIRTHDAY

Before we again go to press, Lincoln’s birthday anniversary will have come and gone,

so that it is incumbent upon us that we:

should fittingly observe the approaching birth- date of this great man with the due respect to which it is justly entitled.

It has been said that one notable charac- teristic of Lincoln, was his fine equipoise of temperament— his sterling character. Strict- ly honorable and of unusually .sensible atti- tude of mind, he was firm, and yet so kind and had such a fund of humor in his regard of others’ opinions, that he usually gained his desire by allowing others to have their say. A well-known writer once said of him, after a personal interview, .‘‘He seems to me somewhat like a ship’s cable—swaying with the tide, but holding fast at both ends.”” Of one thing we are sure: he was a capable manager of men. Another striking thing worthy of comment was the steadfast pa- tience and persevering intelligence with which by constant study of a few choice books, by contii u lly fraining himself to clear, concise thinking, and by learning to say tersely what he thought, he finally became master of an unsurpassed English style of speech. His addresses, his state, public and private cor- respondence, all possess this distinction, and none of them more so than his brief address at the dedication of the National Cemetery at Gettysburg, a year after the war bad been fought; though it was written while en route in the cars, on the way to the ceremony.

On that occasion Edward Everett was the chiet orator of the day, and although him- self a past master of oratory, he wrote a note to the President on the following morn- ing stating: ‘I should be glad if I could flat- ter myself that I came as near to the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in a few minutes.”’

Which recalls to mind the fact that Mr. Everett’s eloquent address is nearly forgot- ten, while Lincoln’s brief, concise remarks are remembered as a classic, and as a fine example of his manner and purity of speech.A man that can succeed in working 1s to me always a man. —Carlyle.
