JEWELS OF AN IDOL

The jewels of an Indian idol must be worth stealing if many of those remarkably hideous images possess such valuable head ornaments as one made for the idol Parthasathy, in the Triplicane temple in Madras. The ornament is worth some 50,000 rupees and is made of sovereign gold studded with diamonds, emer- alds and rubies, the largest emerald being val- ued at 1,000 rupees and the biggest ruby and diamond at 300 rupees apiece.
