THE KEY OF TIBALDO

The "key of death’’ is a large key which is shown among the weapons at the arsenal at Venice. It was invented by Tibaldo, who, disappointed in love, designed this instrument for the destruction of his rival. The key is so constructed that the handle may be turned around, revealing a small spring, which being pressed a very fine needle is driven with considerable force from the other end. This needle is so very fine that the flesh covers over the wound immediately, leaving no mark, but the death of the victim is almost instantaneous.
