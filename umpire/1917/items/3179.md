WAR NOW COSTING $160,000,000 DAILY

According to the estimates made by the Mechanics and Metals National Bank of New York, the belligerent nations of the world now spend at the rate of $160,000,000 a day—$6,500,000 an hour—and the United States is paying at least one-quarter of this staggering sum. By next August, according to the bank’s figures, the total cost to the world will be $155,000,000,000. Already expenditures have exceeded $100,000,000,000, of which all but a small fraction bas been translated into permanent national indebtedness.

Interest on public debt is now calculated to be more than 10 per cent. of the normal income of the German people, as compared with less than 4 of 1 per cent. in the case of the people of this country. About 53,000,000 men are today engaged in the war. To what extent the allies have gained superiority over Germany is shown by the bank in striking fashion.
