THE OLDEST BOOK

It is announced that the oldest book continues to be the best seller.” Year after year the Bible is away ahead of any other.

“Since the war started, publishers tell me, millions of copies of Holy Writ have gone to the soldiers. Our United States exports of Bibles have been very large the past year.

“Many religions are represented under the flags of contending armies, in which are found Japanese, Turks, Algerians and Indians, besides the many shades of difference in European countries.

“But the Bible, written by 40 different authors over a period of 1600 years, is the book of books, and has been for centuries.

“If all that the Bible teaches about the hereafter were false, the world is still enormously bettered merely by the vast circulation of such inspiring literature among the generations of men as they come and go.”
