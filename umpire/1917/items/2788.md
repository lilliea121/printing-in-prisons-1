THE INDICTMENT

The ‘‘Liberty Loan’’ is over, Uncle Sam is going to fight 
For the lives of women and children, and everything that’s right;
Uncle Samuel is determined, and has entered in the race, 
And for the Kaiser’s Army we will surely go in haste.

We have stood his shady dealings, humiliation, and disgrace
Until we were pointed at with scorn by every other race;
But he shall answer to your ‘‘Uncle,” who was forced into this fight,
And to defeat this German War Lord we shall strive with all our might.

The lives of women and children he has held in cheap esteem,
For when in their dying moments, hisleering face has beamed;
But the works of God grind slowly, and he’ll surely pay his toll,
When his name’s among the missing on St. Peter’s “Honor Roll.”

The Lusitania’s victims cry out with all their might 
To avenge their ruthless murder on that dark and stilly night:
So with a “God of Justice’’ standing nobly by our side
This friend of hell must perish for our martyred ones who died.
