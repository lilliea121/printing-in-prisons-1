LEGGINS OF ASBESTOS

Wearing of old shoes in the foundry is a bad idea. In case of a spill, a shoe which is in a bad condition will allow the molten mertal to reach the skin and burn it. It is cheaper, in the long run, to spend money for a new pair of molderâ€™s Congress shoes. The use of Congress shoes as well as the leggins is advised. A very good type of leggin, worn in gome foundries, is made of asbestos in the shape of a boot and covering the entire top of the foot. It is held in place by steel bands which are sprung over the leg.
