SOLDIERS PAY

A bill introduced in Congress to pay a bonus of $50 a month to the American soldiers sent to Europe met opposition on the ground that an American soldier didn’t have to be paid to make him patriotic, says a writer in Leslie’s.

Uncle Sam shows up as a generous provider as compared with some of the other nations. 

The Austrian soldier gets the munificent salary of 97 cents a month. France pays her poilus $1.45 for the same period of service, while the German in the trenches receives $3.78 and the Italian $2.67. There is a wide range of payment between Great Britain and her colonies. The English tommy is paid $7.30 a month, although he fights side by side with the Canadian at $33, the New Zealander at $36.50 and the Australian at $43.80, the highest-paid man of them all. foots the list at 39 cents a month for actual war service. All of these figures are for the lowest grades of fighting men, with the amounts rendered in the equivalent of American currency.

The lowest pay of an American soldier is $30 a month at home, which increases to $33 a month in foreign duty. It is hardly to be believed that putting a premium on patriotism would even please the men most concerned.
