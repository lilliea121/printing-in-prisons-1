CUT IT OUT!

If you have a grouch that pains you, Cut it out; Or a habit that enchains you, Cut it out., Don’t waste time in useless thinking; You can’t cure yourself by winking. So, just can the foolish shrinking— Cut it out.

If you’re fond of sorrows telling, Cut it out;

Ere you hear the chorus swelling: “Cutiitiout

Folks are bored by all this goating

And this grief-charged anecdoting;

If you want to keep a-floating, Cut it out.
