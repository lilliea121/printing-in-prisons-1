Our First BattleshipOf our so-called modern American battleships, the old Texas of Spanish-American warfare was the first. She was authorized by Congress in 1886 and was completed six years later. The original battleship was little over 300 feet long and had a displacement of 6,315 tons. The present day Texas is 554 feet long and has a tonnage of 27,000 tons. The old Texas ended her days as a target for navy practice.
