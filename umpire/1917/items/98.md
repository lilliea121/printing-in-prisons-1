CONCERT BY THE L.ADIES’ OF SAN DOMINGO CHORAL

The Ladies’ of San Domingo Choral gave a delightful concert of song at this institution on Sunday afternoon, under the clever direc- tion of Dr. Joseph Burns, with Miss Loreto MecCann as accompanist.

The program consisted of a pleasing selec- tion of sacred and classical music, which was rendered in a charming manner, alike pleas- ing to the assembled guests and to the in- mates. Judging from the delightful blend- ing and control of voices as evinced by the singers, and the many expressions of praise, Dr. Burns has good cause to feel proud of his talented chorus.
