WHAT IS THE MOST VALUABLE METAL?

If you were guessing you would naturally say that gold is, of course, the most valuable of the metals. But you would be wrong, says the ‘‘Book of Wonders.” The proper answer to this is iron. We do not mean the pound-for-pound value, for you, could get much more for a pound of gold than for a pound of iron. We mean in useful value— iron is in that sense the most valuable metal known to man. This is true because iron is of such great service to man in so many ways, and it is very fortunate that there is such a great amount of it available for man’s purposes. Iron is not generally found in a pure state in the mines. It is generally found compounded with carbon and other substances, and we obtain pure iron by burning these substances out of the compound.
