STARTING LIFE ANEW

Youth is marching to the front. Old age and middle age remain behind to make up the home guard. Ruthlessness has called the “comers’’ in business and professional life.

Eyes that have grown tired from watching the drab scenery along the weary road of failure are brightening. Steps that have been halting and uncertain have regained the spring of youth. Many men are starting life all over again at the age of 60 or 50 or 40, and in the absence of youth they are not tobe denied.

The grim reality of the existence of war is shot through with its strips of silver, says the Sioux City Journal. Everywhere, the land over, the men who were not swift enough for the pace of youth are ‘‘coming back.” And what an inspiring sight it is to see the elderly man step back into theranks, head up, chest out, ‘dressed in the garments of anticipated success. as a father who has been regarded with some suspicion by sons and daughters, he is now regarded as one who for all his life has been misjudged, and who, given the opportunity, has power to lead all men. It is given to sons and daughters to forget economic facts in this new judgment.
