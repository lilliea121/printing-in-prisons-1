HIS TRUST NOT IN VAIN

In a recently published article by Frank M. White, he tells a unique incident of a former warden’s daring experiments to prove a sense of honor among the men of the prisons. One night in the spring of 1915 the delegates of the Mutual Welfare League had held an election in the prison court-room in Sing Sing, and the count was not finished until after one o’clock in the morning. The warden then invited the fifty-four delegates to his house, sent for his cook and butler, both convicts, and served sandwiches and coffee. The warden’s house, which has no bars on windows or doors, is outside the prison walls; there was no guard within a hundred feet of it. The New York Central Railroad tracks are just under the windows on one side, and the public highway on the other. After their repast the prisoners, a number of them under life sentences, went quietly to their cells. Had any of the men escaped or made the attempt to escape, the warden would have been an object of derision and the future of the Mutual Welfare League imperilled. He was ds confident that they would not take advantage of his hospitality as he would have been in the instance of any others of his friends.
