BISHOP WOODCOCK ON WORRY

“Worry weakens the heart and hardens the arteries. It destroys more than rum or vice. It is as sinful as drinking or gambling. It is a cowardly thing, a sign of personal weakness.’’

So saith Bishop Woodeoek, of Kentucky, and we think he is right, says a writer in the Evening Telegraph.

Not many generations ago a boy had to ac- quire a taste for whiskey before he was considered a man. Nowadays many people think they must acquire the worry habit to show they are serious, responsible citizens.

The habitual use of opium is not more deadly or unnecessary than than the custom of worrying about something all the time. In fact opium is said to give one a brief pe- riod of pleasure. Worry is 100 per cent. loss.
