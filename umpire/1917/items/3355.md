OUR FIRST COINS

The first coins really deserving the name of United States coinage were struck off as ‘‘pattern pieces’’ by Benjamin Dudley at the instigation of Robert Morris and were laid before congress in 1783 as specimens of what the coinage should be. They were a “mark” and a ‘‘quint’’ and are thus described: The ‘‘mark’’—observe, an eye, the center of a glory, thirteen points cross equidistant a circle of as many stars. The ‘‘quint’’ is similar in design, the value on reverse being noted.
