ACQUAINTANCE WITH GOD A JOY

There is little doubt that the strong characteristic of the early Christains was their joy in daily communion with God. But nowadays it often seems as if religion was a burden to be carried. In the old days it was the unbounded faith that carried believers as if on eaglesâ€™ wings. This contrast is heightened all themore by contrast of circumstances.

Perhaps nearly a majority of Christians fifty years after Calvary were slaves, subject to compulsion and indignities and with little hope of comfort or worldly success. Yet the impression they made upon their generation was that of people who were in possession of a great and overflowing joy. They went joyfully to drudgery. They sang hymns in prison at midnight with backs sore from the whip. They went to their death like those who saw a heavenly vision. A company of such happy Christains in every village and city would simplify the problemofevangelism. This joy was so strange in that old, weary Greek and Roman world that men were attracted to Christainty by it as the iron filings are attracted by the magnet. It brought many a sorrowing man and woman into the fold to experience the joy of a loving acquaintance with God.
