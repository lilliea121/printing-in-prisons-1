WHAT THE FALLING LEAVES TEACH US

There is nothing in the world that so reminds us that time is fleeting and ourselves going with it, as the falling leaves. It is really a solemn time for one to see a leaf fluttering down through the air to the ground. Itis a reminder that that is the way we are going— falling to the ground and soon disappéaring and forgotten. But the thought should be one of hope rather than of despair, for the very circumstance should inspire everyone to live a better and truer life, and make the world brighter because the leaves fall. The leaves have done their share in the world’s work. They have brought beauty to the woods and fed the fruits and flowers thrcugh the summer, They have earned their rest, but they have something else to do, and that is to make music for the footsteps that move through them. The music of the deep leaves of the forest is imitated nowhere else. It finds expression in no instrument, unless it be in the heartstrings, where no sound is heard.
