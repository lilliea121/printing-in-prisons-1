JOBS FOR BLIND SOLDIERS

It is an established fact that the blind far exceed in acuteness of hearing and sensitiveness of touch their fellow-men who have unimpaired sight. The French, with their usual forethought, have taken this into consideration in planning for occupations for French soldiers after the war. French scientists, after careful investigation, have decided that the blind soldiers WIH make the best wireless operators.

In opening these positions to her blind soldiers France will not be performing any charity in the common use of that term. She will simply be fitting the best man to his job, and giving the men who fought for her their deserved opportunity. The benefit derived will be for the public as well as the individual.
