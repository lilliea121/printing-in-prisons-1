SWOLLEN GRAIN SAVES SHIP

One of the most unusual salvages yet recorded in these days of submarine warfare, is that of the Norwegian steamship Kongsli, whose grain swelled to such an extent on the inrush of water through the ragged hole torn in her side by a torpedo, that the hole was clogged up and the water prevented from flowing in and sinking her. 

A party of fishermen, clambering aboard to discover the trouble, were amazed to find that the ragged hole on oneside and the hull plate torn loose on the other by the force of the explosion had been effectively plugged by the swollen grain, says Popular Science Monthly. 

The fishermen were afraid to attempt to tow her beause the rush of the water along her sides might have washed away the effective grain seal. Accordingly, they improvised bales made of cotton filled with grain and forced these into the holes. This made the stoppage secure enough to enable the vessel to be towed to a nearby port.
