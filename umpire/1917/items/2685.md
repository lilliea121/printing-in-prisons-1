MOTHER'S DAY

I can hear my mother weeping, 
Her tears are trickling fast,
She sits in a corner thinking, 
When she kissed me last.
She wishes to kiss me now, 
She wants to see me I know, 
Her heart is filled with sorrow, 
And her tears continually flow.

Oh, how sweet is her love, 
Her kindness and all the rest 
She taught me of God above, 
Since I was on her breast.

When I think of my dear mother, 
My heart commences to pain,
I feel so pensive and bothered, 
That I am unable to explain.

Oh, if I only knew 
The day when I left her alone,
I on account of my youth didn’t know, 
What was meant by mother’s love.

I will now go back home, 
To my beloved mother far away; 
Never again will leave her alone, 
Don’t forget Mother’s Day.
