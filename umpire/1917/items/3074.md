PERIL IN UNCLEAN DISHES

The danger of contracting disease by eating from unclean dishes or drinking from unclean glasses at restaurants and soda fountains is pointed out by Director of Health Krusen in his weekly bulletin.

“Dishes are rapidly washed and rinsed at many restaurants, giving no assurance of cleanliness and protection to the patrons,’’ he says. ‘‘At some of the drinking fountains the usual practise is to rinse glasses in a bucket or basin of water afteyr use, and then place them upside down to drain.’’

State Commissioner of Health Dixon devotes his health talk to warning persons against taking patent medicines when they do not know the nature of their illness.
