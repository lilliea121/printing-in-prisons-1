THE EMBLEM OF CHRISTIANITY

The emblem of practical Christianity is the Samaritan stooping over the wounded Jew. No fastidious hand can lift from the dust fallen humanity and bind up its unsightly gashes. Sentimental lamentation over evil and suffering may be indulged in until it becomes a sort of melancholy luxury, like the weeping for Thammuz by the apostate daughters of Jerusalem.
