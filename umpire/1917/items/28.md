SHEKELS AND HALF SHEKELS

The early Biblical reference to pieces of silver do not in the original convey the ideas of coins, but to weight, shekels. The Mosaic ‘“‘oblation to God’’ was a half shekel, and the shekel is explained by Josephus as equal to four Athenian drachmae of the value of about 554 cents in American money. first Jewish coinage under authority was, it is believed, struck by Simon, the Maccabee, about the year 140 B._C. It consisted of shekels and half shekels. This coinage had its value signified upon it, ‘‘Shekel Israel,”’ in Samaritan characters.
