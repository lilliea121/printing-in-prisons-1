EVILS THAT BESET YOUNG MEN

The question was recently asked a prominent educator of broad mind and long experience, “What do you consider the greatest evils among young men in the cities, and what do you consider would be the best thing to be done that is not being done now to make more manly men of the youth of our cities?" After some thought, he answered, ‘Lack of home training, failure to profitably employ leisure hours, lack of definite aim in life, the saloon, the dance hall, larceny, false ideas obtained in the movies, unhappy homes and lack of civic interest in the community.”’ Some of the remedies suggested were: ‘‘Arouse interest in civic affairs; give the young men a definite aim in life; supervise the dance halls; make better and more cffective use of our public schools for evening instruction; more stringent laws against the receivers of stolen goods; more places of proper entertainment and recreation for young men, and greater care in religious training in the home.” The one needed remedy suggested by the greatest number was a detention home in the country, where boys who had juststarted into evil could be under homelike care and training and their life changed at this formative period.
