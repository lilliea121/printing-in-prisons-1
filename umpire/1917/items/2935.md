ALFALFA FOR LUNCHEON

Perhaps we will soon be ‘‘eating grass like an ox, if all that is said of alfalfa be true,” avers a writer in a recent issue of a farm journal.

Alfalfa, which is usually thought of as food for cattle, was served to Kentucky farmers in the form of hot biscuits, doughnuts, cake and candy, at a luncheon during the recent farmers’ week exhibition of the Agricultural College at the State University.

The progressive young women of the domestic science department took care of the cookery and convinced their farmer guests that very palatable products may be obtained for the table from their alfalfa crops.

The flour of alfalfa is of a creamy tint before cooking and a light green afterward, and white pea-green biscuits may not at first appeal to the average housewife, the flavor is regarded by many as rich and delicious. Food requirements may easily resultin greatly increased use of alfalfa for flour in the near future. The recipes used in cooking it are about the same as those for wheat flour. Alfalfa candy is made from a glucose pressed from the stalk.
