EARNS $21 PER DAY AS MINER.

$21 per day is pretty good pay for a miner. At least such is the opinion of Robert Conway, a West Virginia coal miner, who load- ed 17 cars of coal the other day, for which he received $21.25. It is said that Conway was a former Southern league baseball player with a good pitching record.
