AUSTRALIA PROTECTS THE FALLEN

We have it from the New Era that in Australia it is now a felony for any person to circulate oral, written or printed information to the effect that a person has served time in prison. In other words, when a man’s sentence expires, Australian society considers the debt as paid and protects the former prisoner by imprisoning any one who even speaks of his past record in public.

What a record of enlightenment is represented there!

And how much more humane it would be for America to do likewise!

Man no longer eats man. Christians do not burn witches. American society is not supported by slaves. Opium joints are out of being. Prize fights are on the wane. Race tracks are regulated by law. Gambling But the prisoner’s sin seems unpardonable.

When will the intelligent civilization of this great country respond to the needed and helpful requirements of men discharged from prison, in the Australian way?

To the latter question we venture to say that if recent reports are true, the state of Washington now has a similar law in its penal code.

What state will be next to follow this excellent innovation?
