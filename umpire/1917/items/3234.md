INDIGO NOW MADE IN'MICHIGAN

Advices from Midland, Mich., tell us of the first production of indigo from coal tar in the United States. One thousand pounds of 20 per cent. paste are produced daily, dispite the fact that in the last tariff bill the duty on dye-stuffs was removed from indigo. The annual consumption of indigo in normal times is in the neighborhood of 10,000,000 pounds.

By 1972 the German makers of coal tar in- digo, which is chemically the same as the product of the tropical indigo plants, has driven the natural product from the worldâ€™s markets. The artificial is considered the bet- ter and more reliable than the natural dye.
