OCTOBER 26 SET FOR ARBOR DAY

A Harrisburg correspondent writes that Dr. Nathan C. Schaeffer, State Superintendent of Public Instruction, has issued his autumn Arbor Day Proclamation designating Friday, October 26 as the date and urging people because of the war to plant trees extensively. ‘‘The problems of conservation and reforestation are more pressing than ever before,” says the Superintendent.
