WHEN MAN IS A FAILURE

When he has no confidence in himself nor his fellow-man.
When he values success more than character and self-respect. 
When he does not try to make his work a little better each day.
When he becomes so absorbed in his work that he can not say that life is greater than work.
When he lets a day go by without making seme one happier and more comfortable.
When he values wealth above health, self-respect and the good opinion of others.
When he is so burdened by his business that he finds no time for rest or recreation.
When he loves his own plaints and interests more than humanity.
When he knows that he is in the wrong, but is afraid to admit it.
When he envies others because they have more ability, talent or wealth than he has.
When he does not care what happens to his neighbors or to his friend so long as he is prosperous.
When he is so busy that he has no time for smiles and cheering words.
