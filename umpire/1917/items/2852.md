WHERE THIEVES MEET

It is true that many strange things come out of the Rus- sian revolution, but none more so than a convention recently held at Rostoff-on-the-Don, says The Index.

This was a convention of THIEVESâ€”men who had preyed on society in all manner of illegitimate ways. They said they had gathered to demand a place in the new freedom, and a chance to turn over a new leaf.

Imagine a convention of thieves and safe-blowere in Madison Square Garden or Chicago Auditorium! Imagine a gathering of confessed pickpockets and strong-arm men in Dreamland rink or in a public plaza in New Orleans! 

You have guessed it right. The reserves would come on the double quick.
