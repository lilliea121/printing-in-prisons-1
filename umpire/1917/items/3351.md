WAR WORK FOR PRISONERS

Again the report is current that plans to take convicts from prisons and put them to work to aid the Government in the prosecution of the war are to be worked outat a conference of prison experts in Washington in the near future.

The foregoing was announced here by William H. Wadhams, Court of General Sessions.

It is to be hoped that something will be done to make use of the large number of men now in idleness in many of the penal institutions throughout the country. Such a step would benefit both the Nation and the men doing time.
