SURGERY AS A CURE FOR CRIME

It is asserted on reliable authority that fifty per cent. of the criminals in this country under thirty years of age can be restored to good citizenship under proper surgical attention.

Judge George W. Bridgeman of Benton Harbor, Mich., made that statement at the dinner of the American association of Orificial Surgeons in the Hotel La Salle in Chicago, Ill.

"Seventy-five per cent. of the criminals brought into courts of this country are be- tween the ages of fifteen and twenty-four years and 80 per-cent. of them suffer from physical disability.’’ said Judge Bridgeman.

"In most of these cases this disability is responsible for mental disability, manifested in crime, and it is capable of correction.’’

It is understood that a billis being prepared for presentation at the next session of the Michigan Legislature, providing for surgical operation on habitual criminals in that state.

Should the experiment prove successful there it is likely that similar legislation will follow in other states.

As a noted surgeon puts it, ‘‘something has got to be done to counteract the growth of crime.”
