LUMINOUS LIFEBELT

In the darkness of a storm at sea, many a shipwrecked person, clinging to a life pre- server, has finally despaired and gone down, for lack of means by which he or she could signal to rescuers. This fact has recently prompted the invention of a luminous lifebelt, by a resident of New York city. It is made in either circular or folding form, and firmly strapped to it are two electric flashlights, thoroughly insulated against contact with the water and operated by a conveniently located button. The two lights are placed some distance apart so that if one is submerged the other probably will project above the water. The flashing signal of such a life belt would many times attract attention when a person clinging to an ordinary preserver would be undiscovered in the darkness.
