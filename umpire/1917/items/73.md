QUEENSLAND SAVAGES FADING AWAY

The aborigines of Queensland are fast fad- ing away, and in view of the fact that this race will be extinct an examination of their social customs is interesting.

The death bone or bone apparatus, with its supposed property of producing death, is one of the most dreaded and universal supersti- tions among the natives of the Queensland interior. . The apparatus consists of a pointer connected by a string with an elongated cylin- drical receptacle. The pointer, three to tive inches long, is made from a human forearm bone, the string is made from human hair, and the receptacle, which encloses the viec- tim’s life-blood, is fashioned from a shinbone. The ‘‘medicine man’’ of the tribe uses the weapon by aiming the pointer at the perscn selected for punishment.

One of the most curious of the aborlglnal weapons is the ‘“‘whirler,”’ or ‘‘bull roarer.”’ It is made of a flattened piece of gidyea tim- ber cut into spindle shape, into one extremity of which a hole is drilled with a sharpened emu bone. By means of the aperture this whirler is attached to a piece of stick fixed at the end of a small stick. Revolving rapidly, the whirler gives out a roaring sound.QUEENSLAND SAVAGES FADING AWAY
