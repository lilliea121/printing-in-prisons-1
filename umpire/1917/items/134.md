SEGREGATION OF PRISONERS

An important and far-reaching considera- tion, that could safely be introduced into all prisons, is the segregation of prisoners. That it ie necessary if first offenders are to be saved from association with hardened ecrimi- nals, is evident. Every prison possesses its bad characters whose influence upon men in- carcerated for the first time, and in many cases for trivi 1 offenses, often prove the ruination of what might have become useful citizens. Classifying men in prison, separat- ing them according to their records, and pos- itively prohibiting careless intermingling of all races, creeds and nationalities, is worthy of the effort from a humanitarian standpoint. Prisons abound with demoralizing influences, and it is only true reform to lessen evil en- vironment for the many who are easily sway- ed. Let us hope this comes to pass soon for the benefit of those men whose first experi- ence in prison is teaching them a beneficia) lesson. â€”New Era.
