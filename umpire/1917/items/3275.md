CHEMICAL LAKES

There are several lakes in the United States which contain sodium carbonate, borax, potash, and common table salt, says the Popular Scitence Monthly.

The longer the war continues the more valuable these chemlcal bodiesbecome. Perhaps the best known of these is Great Salt Lake, Utahâ€™s ocean of salt. Others are Searles Lake, Owens Lake, and Mono Lake, all in California. The origin of these lakes is doubtful. In some cases they are probably due to an arm of the ocean becoming land-locked. The most remarkable feature about them is the fact that they seem to be continuously fed from subterranean sources, since they maintain a uniform amount of salt.
