OUR NATIONAL BIRD

Our national bird, the bald eagle, wild in its native haunts, is so large, so majestic, and flies with an evidence of so enormous strength, that one is impressed with the thought that here is the king of birds. On one occasion while eating my lunch in the shade of a little bush on a Southern prairie, I saw one carry off a lamb, writes T. Gilbert Pearson of the Audubon society.
