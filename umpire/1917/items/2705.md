MOVING STONES

A correspondent writes that there is a curiosity in Long Pond, which lies mostly in Bridgeton, Cumberland county, Maine, and which has often afforded matter of speculation.

On the easterly side of the pond is a cove which extends about one hundred rods farther east than the general course of the shore.

The bottom is clay, and so shoal that a man may wade fifty rods into the pond. At the bottom of this cove are stones of various sizes, which, it is evident from various circumstances, have an annual motion toward the shore. The proof of this is the mark or track left behind them, and the bodies of clay driven up before them.

Some of these stones are two or three tons weight, and have left a track of several rods behind them, having at least a common cartload of clay before them. The shore of the cove is lined with these stones, which, it would seem, have crawled out of the water.
