SHE IS THE ONE

It’s the wife of the man behind the wall 
That knows the weight of a fellow’s fall. 
She is the one that can tell, pard, 
Whether or not the game is hard; 
Most of the prison term she bears, 
All of the prison grief she shares, 
Patiently suffering silently, 
While her heart aches most violently.

Yet she smiles on writing days, 
Bringing her husband hopeful rays, 
Whispers to him sweet words of peace; 
Yearns and pines for his release. 
None more noble my mind recalls 
Than the wife who sticks when the husband falls. 
So pal, if you have a wife that’s true 
Don’t turn her down, whatever you do; 
A good, true wife is hard to find; 
One who’ll stick when your’re doing time.
