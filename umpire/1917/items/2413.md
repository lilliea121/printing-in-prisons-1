Elimination of 1005 Useless Laws Bill PassesIt is announced from Harrisburg that sixty-seven bills providing for the repeal of obso- lete laws were introduced in the House at the late afternoon session by Mr. Whitaker, of Chester. These bills were included in a single act known as "the omnibus repealer" in the session of 1915, which was vetoed by the Governor on the ground that they should have been grouped according to subjects. The bills presented were drawn to meet the objections. They would repeal 1005 laws which have either been superseded or declared unconstitutional by the courts.
