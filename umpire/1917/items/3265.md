INDIVIDUAL STILL COUNTS

Games like football and tennis are being utilized to a large extent in the training of our soldiers in camp. They develop physical fitness, but they go farther and produce what modern psychologists are calling moral tone. Physical tone has a very direct influence on moral tone, says a writer in the Evening Telegraph.

It has been said that battles of England were won on the football fields of Eton and Rugby. Professor Ross interprets this as meaning that the coolness of the British officer in a Dervish charge or an Afghan rush is the same imperturbability that the seasoned football player attains when, amid the cheers of excited thousands, he thinks quickly and unerringly what is to be done.

The private in the ranks, however. profits from games and sports equally with the officer. He shows form when he displays all-around efficiency, physical and mental, and especially when he manifests the game spirit in success or defeat. There is no better place than the athletic field to acquire the moral as well as physical tone which insures the triumph of will over impulse. It is essential to good team play, for the individual still counts in athletics and war.
