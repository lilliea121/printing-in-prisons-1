SCRATCH A CHIEF JUSTICE

The primitive disposition in man, which remains unchanged below the surface although the appearances are refined, is humorously illustrated in the Canadian Magazine by a story of Sir Matthew Begbie, Chief Justice of British Columbia.

In a case tried before Sir Matthew, in which one man was accused of sandbagging another, the evidence was conclusive, but to his amazement and disgust a verdict of ‘‘Not Guilty’’ was returned.

“Gentlemen of the jury, this is your verdict, not mine’’ thundered Sir Matthew. “‘If there were many repetitions of such conduct as yours trial by jury would become a horrible farce and the city of Victoria would be. turned into a nest of criminals. Go! I have nothing more to say to you.”

He then turned to the prisoner and said savagely: 

“You are discharged! Go and sandbag some of the jurymen; they deserve it.”
