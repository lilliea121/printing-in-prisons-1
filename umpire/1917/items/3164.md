Before the war Germany was the most highly socialized State in the world. Now the war is forcing the complete adoption of the theory of Karl Marx. It remains to be seen whether the masses of the German people will be willing to go back to the old social system after the war, or whether they will insist that if Socialism is good enough for the Empire in war it must be good enough for the Empire in peace, says the N.Y. American. We are inclined to think that they will hold fast to Socialism, that their example will excite similar action in other European countries, and that in a few years the whole bunch of kings, potentates, princes, aristocrats and bureaucrats will be working for a living in every country from Petrograd to Lisbon.
