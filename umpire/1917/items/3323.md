GRASSHOPPERS AT SEA

The grasshopper would seem to have nothing in common with the seagull, yet grasshoppers have been picked up in swarms at sea, 1,200 miles from the nearest land.

The African grasshopper, according to the Popular Science Monthly, has been known to cross the Red and Mediterranean seas in destructive numbers and even fly to the Canary Islands. For the most part, these grasshoppers are of a migratory species (Schistocera tartarica) noted for its great flights. The bodies are about four inches long and are equipped with large air sacks in addition to the usual breathing tubes. These sacs buoy up the insect so that it is able to stay in the air for days at a time, exerting practically no effort at all. During flight its speed varies from 3 to 20 miles an hour. When it is tired it rests on the water and is borne along on the waves.
