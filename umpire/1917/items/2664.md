STORES IN BURMA

You may walk through the muddy old markets of Rangoon for hours at a time or through the bazaar at Mandalay without any of the salespeople taking the slightest notice of you as a possible purchaser of their wares. The dear little ladies sit crosslegged upon long tables in front of the high cupboards containing their goods. They are placidly smoking or chatting or painting their faces or braiding their hair. They are not attending to their business in the least.

It requires a great effort to get a Burmese shopwoman (they are nearly all women) to show you her silks, and when at last she has spread her merchandise broadcast upon the table and you are reveling in the illusion that you are living in the middle of a rainbow, with a chance of holding fast to some of its colors, she will ask her price, which is seldom more than a rupee too much, and will stick to it like glue.

She is an indolent lady in many ways, who loves a quiet life, and she has determined that her most comfortable course is not to haggle in the market place. So you may make up your mind that bargaining and persuasion are useless arts to practise in Burma, however valuable they may be elsewhere.
