VIEWED FROM A CITY’S MOUNTAIN TOP

On gaining the top of one of New York’s man-made mountains there is to be found the same ‘‘peaceiul quiet ascn ary mountain top. No sound from the street below comes up this distance. Men on the sidewalks are in- finitesimal dots, darting hither and yon. Looking down upon them, one is inclined to reflectiwhat puny beings humans are and from this lofty point of view almost forgets his sympathy for their personal interests. ; Then comes the realization that this mountain was built by these puny beings from materials dug out of the earth in a crude s’?ate, purified, shaped and fastened together in a manner that will make it stand practically for all time, and then a feeling of reverence for the human brain—that God-given boon which has made these things possible.”’
