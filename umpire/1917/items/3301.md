It has been found that by feeding silkworms partly on mulberry leaves and partly onosage leaves, being extremely caveful with the allowances of the two foods, they can be made to produce red and blue silk. Colored thread has been obtained by feeding the worms on dyed leaves, but this method is not practical on a commercial scale. The natural color of raw silk is yellow or white.
