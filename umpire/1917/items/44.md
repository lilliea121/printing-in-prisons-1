DESTINIES OF LIFE

Know well, my soul, God’s hand controls Whate’er thou fearest,

Round Him in calmest music rolls Whate’er thou hearest.

Man sees no future—a phantom show Is alone before him;

Past time is dead, and the grasses grow And flowers bloom o’er him.

The present, the present, is all thou hast For thy sure possessing;

Like the patriarch’s angel, hold it fast Till it gives its blessing.

Like warp and woof, all destinies Are woven fast,

Linked in sympathy like the keys Of an organ vast.

Pluck one thread, and the Web ye mar; Break but one

Of a thousand keys, and pammg jar Through all will run.

And in life, in death, in dark, and light, All are in God’s care; Sound the black abyss, night, And He is there. —John Greenleaf Whittier.
