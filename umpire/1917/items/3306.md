LAST QUOTA OF DRAFTEES CALLED FOR

The local draft boards have received word from Harrisburg that it is expected they will send the remainder of their quota of the first draft to camp within the next ten days.

Information has been asked as to the exact date when the last of the first draft men would be sent to camp, and when the first men of the second draft could be sent, so that the War Department could make its plans accordingly. Most of the boards in this city have sent 85 per cent. of their first quotas to camp, but a few have sent only 80 per cent. It is the desire of the War Department to get the work of the first draft out of the way before the second draft call is made.

Next Saturday the sending of the new questionnaires to the registrants not now in uniform will be begun.

The declaraztion of war upon Austria has presented many new problems for the draft boards, and may cause apostponement of the closing of the first draft if many unnaturalized Austrians are found at Camp Meade.
