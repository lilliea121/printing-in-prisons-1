Sage LeavesWe live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to glide well on them.***Life in itself is a mixture of power and form, and it will not bear an excess of either.***Everything good is to be found on life's highway, if you look for it.***The middle region of life is to be found inthe temperate zone.â€¢All good conversation, and action, come from a spontaneity which overlooks usages, and maks the moment live.***Let us not forget that the vari-colored wheel must revolve very fast to appear white.***Why not treat our neighbors well; as if they were human: perhaps they are.-The Ranger.
