The oldest zoological gardens in the world were found in Egypt. Fifteen hundred years B. C. Pharaoh Totmes I, at the request of his daughter, sent an expedition to Somaliland, in northern Africa, to bring back strange animals in large numbers to populate the temple gardens. It is stated that 60,000 animals passed in a parade before the royalties at the dedication of the first zoo.
