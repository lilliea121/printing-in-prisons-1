GOLD SOVEREIGNS

It was in 1817 that the gold coin known as the sovereign was declared to be of the value of 20 shillings. The proclamation declaring this to be its price current was issued on July 5 of that year. In 1489 pieces in value of 20 shillings, ‘‘to be called the sovereign,”’ were ordered to be coined out of a pound of gold, but by 1550 they were passed as of the value of 24 shillings, and by 1552 they were passed as being of the value of 30 shillings. By the coinage act of 1870 the weight of the sovereign was fixed at 123.27447 grains troy.
