THE EXCELSIOR CHESS CLUB TO EXTEND ITS MEMBERSHIP

The Excelsior Chess Club, recently organized by several devotees of the game: is now in a flourishing condition and expects to enroll a sufficient number of beginners and others to its roster to make the coming season a record breaker in the art of scientific chess playing. The dues are merely nominal, or just sufficient to gather enough shekels to provide a suitable prize for the winner of the coming tourney.

All those who think they know how to play chess are invited to join the knights of the chessboard and show their skill. The names of those desirous of membership may be forwarded to B 7940, 6th Block, who is the general manager of the organization, and he will see that the communication receives attention.

The standing of the players in the tournament now in progress is as follows:

Won Lost Drawn Pet. Harry 5 0 0 1600 Harold 2 3 0 .400 Joe 2 3 0 . 400 Carl 1 4 0 .200
