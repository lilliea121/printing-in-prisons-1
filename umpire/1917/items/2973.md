ENLIST OR DEPORT THE ALIEN

In the United States there are hundreds of thousands of able-bodied men from Great Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Greece, Serbia and Rumania.

Their Governments are officially at war with and have conscripted their populations to combat the Teutonic alliance. But their subjects and citizens in America are avoiding service.

Today we are preparing to send millions of our boys to the front. Yet certain treaties make it impossibâ€™e to draft the unnaturalized subjects of our allies.

Those treaties were adopted when no statesmen had conceived of a war in which more than half the world would be allied against virtually all the rest. So they are as much out of date as the flintlock musket.

America is not going to tear up the trea- ties, but she is going to surmount the obstacle which they present. Aliens from our allied countries are likely to have the choice soon of fighting in the American Army or going back home.

The proposal is 100 per cent fair. What can be said for the man who slinks behind while others die in his behalf?
