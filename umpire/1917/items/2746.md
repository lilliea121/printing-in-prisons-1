KEEP UP YOUR PLUCK

Keep up your pluck and take another hold, 
Don’t whimper; it is useless to complain.
Fortune still deals her favors to the bold. 
There’s never loss but somewhereis a gain.

While you have left your body and your brain, 
In spite of all misfortune be consoled, 
There’s always hope while these you still retain, 
Keep up your pluck and take another hold. 

The world to you may seem both hard and cold, 
And yet it is a good world in the main; 
If sympathy is in small measure doled, 
Don’t whimper; it is useless to complain.

With cheerful smiles conceal the hidden pain. 
Leave your vexations and your wrong untold. 
Fight, but if beaten, from weak tears refrain,
Fortune still deals her favors to the bold.

Oh, those invertebrates who fret and scold, 
Make faces at the cup they have to drain, 
Dumbly despair at loss of land or gold! 
There’s never loss but somewhere is a gain. 

Be valiant. Bound, then strive to break the chain 
That binds you. Show yourself of iron mold. 
Sit down and weep and you will weep in vane; 
Work manfully and fate may be controlled.
