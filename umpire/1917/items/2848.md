“MIZPAH”

Go thou thy way, and I go mine, 
Apart, yet not afar; 
Only a thin veil hangs between 
The pathways where we are; 
And God keep watch ’tween thee and me—
This is my prayer. 
He looketh thy way, He looketh mine, 
And keeps us near.
I know not where thy road may lie,
Or which way mine will be, 
If mine will lead through purling sands 
And thine beside the Sea. 
Yet God keeps watch ’tween thee and me, 
So never fear, 
He holds thy hand, He claspeth mine, 
And keeps us near. 
I sigh sometimes to see thy face, 
But since this may not be, 
I’ll leave thee to the care of Him 
Who cares for thee and me. 
I’ll keep you both beneath my wings— 
This comforts, dear; 
One wing o’er thee and one o’er me, 
So are we near. 

—Julia H. Baker.
