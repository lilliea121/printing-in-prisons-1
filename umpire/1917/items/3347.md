ABOUT CHAMOIS

The encyclopedia informsus that "the chamois was a goatlike antelope with small horns inhabiting the Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Caucasus and the mountains of western Asia.’’ There was a time when his hide was used to make ‘‘shammy’’ skins, but the chamois is virtually extinct, so now practically all chamois skins are all sheepskin or part sheep-skin. When the skinis split so as to make two skins, the flesh half is used to make ‘‘chamois.”

The making of so-called ‘‘chamois skins’’ is a rather interesting operation. Alcng the south shore of Long Island, beyond Islip, you are apt to be assailed, if the wind is from the south, by an odor which reminds you of “chamois." It is not the odor of the skin, how- ever, but the pungent ‘‘smell” from a fish oil factory where tons of menhaden are boiled for the oil the fish contains.

"All sheepskins used in the making of ‘‘chamois” leather are treated with nothing but this oil. The skins are immersed in vats of the oil and are permitted to remain there for a month or more. They are wrung out and hung up to dry, turning meanwhile a yellow color.

If a white or cream shade is desired the skins are bleached in the sun after they have been washed in clean water and beaten with a club.
