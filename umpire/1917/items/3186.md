MUST MAKE ALLOTMENT

Every enlisted man in the military or naval forces of the United States must allot for the benefit of a wife or child an amount equal to the Governmentâ€™s family allowance, with a maximum, however, of half his pay and a minimum of $15 per month, declares the Review of Reviews. If he has no wife or child and makes no voluntary allotments for other dependents, or for other purposes, the the Secretary of War or Navy may require him to deposit with the Government at 4 per centum compound interest half his pay, or so much of half his pay as he does not allot either for his dependents or for other purposes.

This puts the man with dependents more nearly on a democratic footing of equality with one who has none and the better-paid American soldier with the poorer-paid Euro- pean with whom he is fighting.

The family allowances are basedon a graduated scale depending on the number of dependents, and are conditioned on allotments of equal amounts up to half pay. In no case, however, does the allowance exceed $50 for one family. An ordinary enlisted man receiving $33 per month in foreign service, if his family is large enough, may be required to allot $16.50 per month and secure thereby for his family a total income of $66.50 per month.
