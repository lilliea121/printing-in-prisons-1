WE NEED MORE LIKE HIM

The Hon. Jacob H. Sckhiff, of New York, recently celebrated his seventieth birthday by giving and not receiving a present. He gra- ciously but firmly declined the banquet that his friends offered him, and in place thereof made the munificent gift of $100,000 to the American Red Cross, the largest gift the organization has received since the beginning of the war. It is his wish that two-thirds of the sum be spent in relieving distress in the Entente countries and one-third be used sim- ilarly in the Central Empires.

It is said that Mr. Secniff did this in re- sponse to President Wiison’s recent appeal for the Red Cross, and it sets a splendid ex- ample which other rich men and women might very well follow.

If there were more Americans of this high type of thought and breadth of action, this world would be that much better for their being in it, and for the elevating influence it would exert for the good of others.

He who works with his hands only is a mechanic; he ‘'whp works with hands and head is a artisan; and he who works with hands, head and heart is an artist.WE NEED MORE LIKE HIM
