WHEN IS A MAN REFORMED?

A man is reformed only when his viewpoint of right and wrong becomes properly adjusted, says the New Era, when his attitude toward society becomes that of pity rather than revenge, when he shows a desire to traverse the straight path instead of the crooked path, when his aspirations visibly denote a voluntarily self-seeking ambition for higher and nobler ideals. Without doubt when this change takes place in a prisoner’s heart, his reformation has been successfully accomplished.

And when this period in the offender’s life reaches this stage, that is the psychological moment to consider giving him another chance. This is the moment to seriously consider granting him the merited reward that he has earned—and which he deserves. Society can do nothing more, it can expect nothing more. When the man has fulfilled his duty toward society, society should fulfil it’s duty toward the man. Further confinement only tends to punish and harden a prisoner rather than make him a better man. Continued and prolonged imprisonment frequently shatters and tears down the good work which may have required many years to build.
