STUPENDOUS WAR FIGURES

The stupendcus figures about war expenditures dismay a good many people and naturally enough. It is not easy to adjust standards so as to consider spending billions where millions were a short time ago considered as possibly extravagant, says the Detroit Free Press. That there should be grave doubts of the countryâ€™s capacity to raise the enormous amounts now proposed or of its ability to sustain their loss if they could be raised is quite intelligible.

Chairman Fitzgerald, of the House Committee on Appropriations, summed up these huge amounts in his speech on the proposed expenditures, and among other things he showed that the total amount raised by Great Britain since the war began had been $15,975,000,000 in bonds and $5,410,000,000 in taxes, while the pending requirements for the United States he put at $11,538,945,460 in bonds and $4,067,000,000 in taxes.

Reduce all these amounts to a per capita basis of the two populations and it will be found that the burden our people are asked to shoulder is about the same as that which has been borne by the people of the United Kingdom. Allow 45,000,000 people for the British side of the calculation and 101,500,000 for the American side, and the relative quotients will be a little less than $120 taxes for every person in the United States, while the respective allotments of bonds will be $344 and $113.
