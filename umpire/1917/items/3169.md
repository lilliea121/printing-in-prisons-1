RULES FOR SUCCESS

At a meeting of the Brooklyn, N. Y. Y. M. C. A., recently, Alfred C. Bedford, president of the Standard Oil Company, delivered a highly interesting address to its members, in which he gave the following rules for success: 

“Do everything you are told to do.

“Have no regard for hours.

‘‘Read and study and think of your work.

“Have imagination, have some vision.

“When a fellow misses a chance, he worries. But there is another coming—it is just around the corner. Catch it as it goes by.

"I always ask any young man that comes into my office whether he has any religious affiliations or not. When any fellow has somebody or something stronger than he, on whom he trusts in temptation, it will bring him over his trials and give him success.’’
