THE TITLE OF CZAR

Many people have hazy views as to the precisely correct use of the title Tsar. There have been, from the ninth to the fifteenth century, no fewer than forty-five ruling dukes and grand dukes of Muscovy before Ivan (John) I assumed the Czarian style, 1482. It continued as the highest title till it was superceded, on October 22, 1721, when Peter the Great declared himself Emperor. It is true that Basil V, sucessor of Ivan III, took the Imperial title, but Czar remained the supreme word for a dozen successions. Since then there have been ten ‘‘Emperors (and four ruling Empresses) of all the Russias.”
