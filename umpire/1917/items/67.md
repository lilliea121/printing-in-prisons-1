A SONG OF TRUST

I can not always see the way that leads To heights above;

I sometimes quite forget that He leads on With hands of love;

But yet I know the path must lead me to Immanuel’s land,

And when I reach life’s summit I shall know And understand.

I can not always trace the onward course My ship must take,

But, looking backward, I behold afar Its shining wake

Illumined with God’s light of love; and so I onward go,

In perfect trust that He who holds the helm The course must know.

I can not always see the plain on which He builds my life;

For oft the sound of hammers, blow on blow, The noise of strife,

.Confuse me till I quite forget He knows And oversees,

And that in all details with His good plan My life agrees.

I can not always know and understand The Master’s rule;

I can not always do the tdSk He gives In life’s hard school;

But I am learning, with His help, to solve Them one by one,

And when I can not understand to say, ““Thy will be done.””’
