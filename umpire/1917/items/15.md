The great American sin of today is pro- fanity. ‘“The use of profane language is not confined to the street loafer, to the thug or the sot; men who move in good society, bus- iness men of standing and reputation, young men and old men, and even boys of tender age are addicted to this inexcusable habit and sin,”’ says Thomas (Okla.) Tribune. There is nothing more disgusting than to hear a man punctuate his every utterance with lu- rid oaths.
