INDOLENCE

Indolence is the sleep of the mind. What is often called indolence is, in fact, the unconscious consciousness of incapacity.

What men want is not talent: it is purpose; in other words, not the power to achieve, but the will to labor.

The darkest hour in the history of any young man is when he sits down to study how to get money without honestly earning it.

Laziness grows on people; it begins in cob- webs, and ends in iron chains.—The more one has to do the more he is able to accomplish. 

Indolence is the dry rot of even a good mind and a good character; the practical uselessness of both. It is the waste of what might be a happy and useful life.

So long as he must fight his way, the man of genius pushes forwaid, conquering and to conquer. But how often is he at last overcome by a Capua! Ease and fame bring sloth and slumber.

Of all our faults, that which we most readily admit is indolence. — We persuade ourselves that it cherishes all the peaceful virtues, and that without destroying the others it merely suspends their functions.

I look upon indolence as a sort of suicide; for the man is effectually destroyed, though the appetite of the brute may survive.
