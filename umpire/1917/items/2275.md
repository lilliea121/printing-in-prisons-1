Argentina's CapitolBuenos Aires is to Argentina what Paris is to France, says a writer in the Geographic Magazine. The center of the national industries, thought and culture. Commerce, journalism, politics, the drama, music, literature, art and social life are intensely focused there. The brilliant activity of the greatest city of the southern hemisphere (the fourth city of the Americas after New York, Chicago, and Philadelphia) draws the Argentines to it as a flame attracts moths, and one-fifth of the population of the country struggles there in feverish competition for pleasure and gain. No traveler to the southern countries but stops as lur g as h~ may in . Buenos Aires to enjoy or to study the most cosmopolitan, yet most Latinized, of the Spanish-American cities. The metropolis is at once the heart and the brain of the country.
