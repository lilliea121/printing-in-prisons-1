BELIEVES IN COURTESY

Charles M. Schwab is a thorough believer in courtesy and is always considerate of another’s feelings.

In a recent conversation with the repre- sentative of a prominent daily, he said:

“When I want to find fault with my men I say nothing when I go through their departments. If I were satisfied I would praise them. My silence hurts them more than anything else in the world, and it doesn’t give offense. It makes them think and work harder.

“Many men fail because they do not see the importance of being kind and courteous to the men under them. Kindness to everybody always pays for itself. And, besides, it is a pleasure to be kind. I have seen men lose important positions, or their reputations—which are more important than any position— by little careless discourtesies to men whom they did not think it was worth while to be kind to.”
