PLACING THE BLAME

"A Chicago judge proposes to punish the parents of delinquent children as the ones actually responsible for the latter’s offenses. There are doubtless many instances where the parents are to blame, either from ignorance, indifference or from having given them a bad example,’’ says a writer in the St. Lowis Star. “A boy or girl is much less influenced by what a parent tells him he must or must not do than by what hisparents actually do and believe. But though parents may.be guilty, the community where delinquency exists is not guiltless.

"We are all largely creatures of environment. Any flaw in our social life is evidence that we, and the conditions we have created, are to blame. Before we lay the blame for youthful vices on the home we should discover whether or not the conditions imposed upon some families or groups of families are not the real cause of crime. By removing the influences at work to degrade certain classes or individuals we shall make crime absurd and almost impossible. Youths become criminal because to them virtue is dull and uninteresting. It is the duty of the community to rectify this. Those responsible for the slums are responsible for the gang and for the crimes of the gang.’’
