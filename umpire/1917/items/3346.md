“MARSH RABBIT” THE LATEST

It is announced in a recent publication that there recently appeared in the Washington, New York and Boston markets many barrels of plump little animals, all dressed and skinned, which were sold as ‘‘marsh rabbits.”

It appears that for several weeks the good people bought these animals, cooked them according to the special directions and served them at family and party dinners as ‘‘rabbits’’—not realizing that this food was really something vastly diffierent from that of the ordinary rabbit.

Now comes the statement that the ‘‘marsh rabbit’’ was nothing less than the muskrat.

All of which goes to show that even now the American people are not averse to being fooled. In fact, they like it. Barnum’s statement holds true and it did when he displayed a sand-papered elephant as “the only sacred white elephant in captivity.”

We sometimes think that this is becoming a “marsh rabbit age.”
