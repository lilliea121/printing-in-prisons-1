ACQUIRE KNOWLEDGE

This is the day when character counts. The day is gone when a young man who seeks a responsible position can be ignorant or de- ficient in character. The youth who is to rule tomorrow is the youth who is storing up resources of knowledge, of self-control, of courage and of steadiness.

The thought of luck no longer holds good; a working knowledge must be acquired be- fore useful knowledge can be given. The young man who is looking forward to a good position must be preparing for it by storing his mind with knowledge, strengthening his character by self-denial and cultivating the power of endurance by grimly hanging on to what he has in hand until something better develops. Then if he has the power of ap- plication, there can be no question as to re- sults.
