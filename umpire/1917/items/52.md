SACRED SONG SERVICE

ON THE CENTER
A well rendered song service was given by the members of St. Philipsâ€™ P. E. church choir, on the Center, at this institution on Sunday last. The program consisted of a tuneful array of sacred song well calculated to please and impress the inmates.

The singers appeared to be in good voice and evinced a clever degree of fine shading in the various parts calling for careful ex- pression. In all, a pleasing afternoon of song, and we hope for an early return of our entertainers.
