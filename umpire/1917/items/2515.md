E. S. P. LEAGUE MEETING A meeting of the Baseball League was held last week at which business pertaining to the game for the ensuing season was discussed. B 7079 was elected President. The name of "The Shed" team was changed to the "Athletics," with B 7684 as manager and B 7685, B 6453 and B 6654 managers respectively of "The Printers," "Cubs" and "Ninth." The Warden, having the interest and pleasure of â€˜this boys" at heart, has given permission for the usual parade, led by the E. S. P. Band, preceding the game. I am quite sure the conduct of all attending the games will be such as our Warden desires. Applause of good plays, etc., should be limited, as much as possible, to hand clapping. Kindly keep this in mind. The spectators must not crowd over the line marking boundaries of playing grounds. Fielders should be given all possible chance to make their plays. Trusting we will have a pleasant and satisfactory season, even should the bill outlined be thrown out at the home-plate, B 7079, President.
