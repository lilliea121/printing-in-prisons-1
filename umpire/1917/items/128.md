GOING THE ROUNDS

A momentous question: your valentine?

Have you sent

*® If you say the right thing at the right time, it often happens that some fossil will

envy you. "

% They say that tall, thin men will be the fashion this summer. Perhaps we can fur-
nish a few at that time.

Wonderful, indeed, is faith when you hear of some of the things that some ‘‘bug’” will

suggest as a cure for that all-gone feeling. sk

Some men spend a lot of time praying for Providence to help them, but it rarely occurs to them to surprise -Providence by helping themselves.

A man left here the other day after long confinement, and immediately proceeded to advertise himself by boasting of his record to an outsider. Let us hope that it’s not catching.

There comes a demand for the coinage of half-pennies, and a man asks if there is any- thing that can be bought for half a cent. To be sure there is. That’s the value of some individuals that have to be reckoned with.

It’s mighty hard to convince some men that our outside friends(?) are not waiting for our release with open arms. The sad awaken- ing will come later, when all this ‘‘con stuff’’ will melt away from our thoughts like the ““fiver’’ that you get on the ‘‘go out.’’

A writer in the news columns of a local pa- per states that a pound box of candy will win a girl quicker than a one-hundred-line poem. Save time, boys, save your time. This poet lore is awful stuff, and will only make hard feelings among your friends, if you try to palm it off on them at your release.GOING THE ROUNDS
