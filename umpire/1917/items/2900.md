CATHOLIC CHOIR GIVES ENTERTAINMENT OF CLASSICAL SONG

The Catholic choir of the E. S. P. gave an entertainment of sacred and classical music at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, that was pronounced the best ever given by that organization since its inception.

The entire program was rendered in a manner that would reflect credit upon professionals. Not a false note or imperfect intonation was to be detected, while the voice blending and the sustaining of the bass and tenor parts was excellent. Professor Joseph Welsh directed the choristers with usual consumate skill, and he is to be congratulated on the fine showing of the singers in their repertoire of high-grade song.

Much credit is due the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, under whose auspices the entertainment was provided, for their continued interest in the welfare of the E. S. P. inmates.

Chaplain Joseph Welch gave a brief address to the assembled guests and choristers at the conclusion of the service, in which he expressed his thanks and appreciation for the clever work of Professor Welsh and the singers.
