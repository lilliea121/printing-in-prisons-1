GOVERNMENT ALARMED OVER LACK OF RECRUITS
Postmasters Ordered to Co-operate In Securing 50,000 ‘More Men

It is announced by a Washington corre- spondent that active steps ‘‘are being taken by the War Department to stimulate recruit- ing to the point necessarv to bring the enlisted strength of the army to the full numerical measure authorized by existing legislation, including the defense act of June 3rd, 1916, which authorized the enlargement of the army in annual increments for the next five years.

Large batches of circulars ‘‘have been sent to 50,000 postmasters, as a result of which, according to information reaching the War Department, also made public today a circular letter prepared and issued by direction of the adjutan’c-general of the army, which is being sent to all patriotic societies and associa- tions as well as to individual citizens in con- nection with offers for service that have been received by the War Department in large numbers recently.’’
