THOROUGHNESS

“I would not be one of those who would foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plastering; such a deed would keep me awake Give me a hammer and let me feel for the furring. Drive a nail home and clinch it so faithfully that you can wake up in the nightand think of it with satisfaction, a work at which you would not be ashamed to invoke the Muse. So will help you God, and so only. Every nail driven should be as another rivet in the machine of the universe, you carrying on the work.” — Thoreau.
