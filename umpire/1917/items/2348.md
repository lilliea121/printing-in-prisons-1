Oppressor of ChildrenThe Pittsburgh Leader is up in arms against employes who violate the child labor law. Ina recent editorial the Leader states that "the arrest and conviction of scores of employersin the Pitsburg district on charges p1stened by the factory inspector came with peculiar force at a time when a desperate battle is being waged in Harrisburg by vicious interests that hope to crush labor and humanitarian laws passed for the protection of working people. These interests l<now they can not violate the child labor and other humane laws with impunity . That is why they haveplanned a raid on the legislature that will take away this protection for the people who earn their living by the sweat of their brow. Pittsburg has its share of inhumane employers who would keep little children at their tasks to the point of exhaustion.
