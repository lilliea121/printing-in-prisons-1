A MORO REGIMENT

No more impressive tribute to General Pershing as a soldier of freedom can be imagined than the fact that a Moro regiment is being organized in the Philippines for possible service under his command in France, says a writer in the N. Y. Evening Mail.

When the Moros in 1902-3 arose in rebellion against the authority of the United States, to Pershing was assigned the task of restoring order in the province and asserting the Pershing did his soldierly duty in soldierly fashion. When the fighting was over, however, the conqueror of the Moros became their friend. By his moderation, his calm justice and his freedom from rancor, he won from the Moros the same respect that he had won in an earlier phase of his military career from the Indians whom he had fought.

And now the Moros are rallying to Pershing.

They are planning to fight for the triumph of the flag which they sought to banish from their land in the past decade.

The conversion of the Moros to friendship for America is a high compliment to Pershing, It is a recognition of the disinterested spirit in which America has striven to make the people of the Philippines fit for freedom.
