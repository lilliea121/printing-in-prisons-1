Thirteen Proves Unlucky for Labor GraftersFrom late news reports it is learned that all thirteen defendants in the celebrated "labor graft'' case at Chicago, were found guilty on charges of conspiracy and maintenance of a boycott, in the Federal Court in that city. The defendants are four former businessagents of the Electrical Workers' Union and nine members of the Chicago Switchboard Manufacturers. Acts of vandalism, persecution by means of strikes and bribery were charged as the specific means by which the defendants kept outside manufacturers whowere not in the "ring" from obtaining or filling contracts.Michael J. Boyle, said to have accumulated a fortune as business agent of Local 134, was regarded as the leader in the so-called con- spiracy.
