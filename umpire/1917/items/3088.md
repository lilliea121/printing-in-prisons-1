BROADER AMERICAN VIEW

The war has been helped to broaden American view and to enforce the lesson of independence, as well as of responsibility. Its exigencies have sharpened our wits and given increased momentum to enterprise, says a writer in the San Antonio Express. We have been shown how easy it is to produce at home many of the things for which Europe had previously been our main if not our sole reliance. We have been awakened from a dream of security that made the nation weak, though it was inherently strong, for we have been caught napping when we should have been alert; defenceless when we should have been prepared for aggressiveness if occasion should demand. But the war, while betraying out weakness, also helped to show our reserve force and to develop a strength that the world at large had hitherto vastly underestimated.
