FEAR A BLIGHT TO CHILDHOOD

Without doubt one of the very worst things that can happen in the life of a child is to induce the sense of fear. Its pernicious effects often last until the age of maturity is reached, and even then, in some cases, is not wholly obliterated. A prominent writer avers that ‘‘no other one attribute contributes more to peace of mind in this life than an absence of fear. To attempt to govern a child by frightening it is a crime, for in children the powers of imagination are exceedingly acute. Children do not reason, they believe. A normal child has no more fear of the dark than of the daylight, but if such a child is put to bed alone in a dark room and told ‘the goblins will get him, if he does not go right to sleep,’ the dark for years afterward will mean a place of vast terror filled with horrible possibilities. Wakefulness, mental strain and nervousness are as sure to follow as day follows night. If fear does show in a child it should never be ridiculed. Fear may be destroyed if a little time is taken to explain why there is no reason to be afraid.’’
