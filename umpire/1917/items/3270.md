CAMPHOR IN THE SOUTH

Camphor is now grown in Florida and Texas, the trees forming attractive hedges. Samuel C. Hood, formerly of the United States Bureau of Plant Industry, gave lately in' the Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry of the American Chemical Society the results of many tests he made in Florida camphor trees. He reached the conclusion that the best yield is obtained from trimming the hedges in the spring and fall during the dormant season of the trees. If the outer leaves and twigs are allowed to remain on the trees through another growing season the yield is decreased.

The faster the trees grow the more gum they secrete so that better results are obtained from trees growing on good ground than on poor ground. Forcing the trees with fertilizer also helps to produce gum. Even every slight shade decreases the yield. Hisresults show a little more than 14 per cent. of pure camphor from the leaves and twigs. For many years this product has been contracted by the Japanese, and it is gratifying to note the progress which is being made in this country.
