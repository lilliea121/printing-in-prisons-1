LETTERS OF APPRECIATION

BAY HEAD, N. J., July 3rd, 1917. Honor and Friendship Club.

Gentlemen:—Mrs. Bartlett very kindly for- warded me your letter advising me of my election as a member of your Honor and Friendship Club, with the title of ‘‘Little Mother.” The name of Mother is the dearest name in all the world, and I can not find words adequate to express my feelings when I read your letter, for you could not have chosen any name that would have made me happier, and I wish to thank you all for the honor, and Mr. Carter for his thoughtfulness in proposing my name. I shall be very glad to accept and wear your button. The same, however, was not enclosed in your letter.

Sincerely, LITTLE MOTHER.


SUNDAY, July 8th, 1917.

Mr. Frank Marvel. 

Dear Sir.—Your communication informing me that I have, by unanimous vote, been made an honorary member of the H. F. C. has just been received. I feel honored indeed, and I will gladly wear the button.

Please convey to the proper authorities the pleasure I feel at being so honored, and accept my grateful thanks.

Very respectfully yours,

(Mrs. E. R.) VIRGINIA G. STONE.
