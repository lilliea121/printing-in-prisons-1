A Song of TrustI can not always see the way that leads To heights above;I sometimes quite forget that He leads on With hands of love;But yet I know the path must lead me to Immanuel's land,And when I reach life's summit I shall know And understand.I can not always trace the onward course My ship must take,But, looking backward, I behold afar Its shining wakeIllumined with God's light of love; and so I onward go,In perfect trust that He who holds the helm The course must know.I can not always see the plain on which He builds my life;For oft the sound of hammers, blow on blow, The noise of strife,Confuse me till I quite forget He knows And oversees,And that in all details with His good plan My life agrees.I can not always know and understand The Master's rule;I can not always do the task He givesIn life's hard school;But I am learning, with His help, to solveThem one by one,And when I can not understand to say,''Thy will be done.
