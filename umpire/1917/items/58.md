PRISON INVESTIGATION BY NEW JERSEY’S GOVERNOR

It is publicly announced that Governor Edge will institute an inquiry into state in- stitution methods at an early date, although it is contended many of the charges respect- ing conditions and methods at the state pris- on in Trenten have been slightly exaggerated or shown to be unduly enlarged upon. Re- cent disclosures, both official and otherwise, are said to have demonstrated that the insti- tution is far from being as it should.

Without prejudging the charges and coun- ter-charges involving the various branches of the prison management, Governor KEdge made it plain that the whole subject will re- ceive his early and ezrnest attention. While it is not the immediate puipose of the Gov- ernor to force a one-sided investigation of the prison management, still, it is expected that whatever is undertaken will-be followed out in a most searching and thorough man- ner. Itis expected that this will disclose

. the actual seat of the trouble, and will event-

ually lead to the adoption of such measures as will result in the enforcing of modern re- form methods.
