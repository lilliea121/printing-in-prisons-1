LUCK AND LABOR

Luck is ever waiting for something to turn up. Labor, with keen eyes and strong will, will turn up something. Luck lies in bed and wishes the postman would bring him the news of a legacy. Labor turns out at 6 o’clock and with busy pen and ringing hammer lays the foundation of competence. Luck whines. Labor whistles. Luck relies on change, Labor on character.— Richard Cobden.
