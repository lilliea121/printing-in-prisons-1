PrayerThy heart to my heart, great King of kings, Throbbing its love and such glad things,Thou thinking to me, God, as I fain would toThee,Unfolding Thy purpose, Thy love, Thy greatplan,Thy heritage sure for each child Df man;Thy infinite patience with slowness and sin, Thus proving Thy power all love to win; Thou, taking my thoughts and transmutingto goldTheir dross and their alloy, with pity untold; Thou, blending Thy will with mine ownFreely proffered to Thee,Thus possessed by Thyself, yet royally free;-This then is Prayer, God M all souls,Such communing with Thee: therefore, 0Father,Think Thou to me.Â·-------A. M. C. Dupree.
