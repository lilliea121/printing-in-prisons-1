RETURNS AFTER TWENTY YEARS

Again the old saying that ‘‘truth is stranger than fiction’’ comes to mind when we read the story of John Nelson, who for nearly twenty years was counted as among the victims of the battleship Maine which was blown up in 1898 while at anchor in the harbor of Havana, Cuba.

John Nelson enlisted in the United States Navy at the age of seventeen, before the Spanish-American war broke out. His family never heard from him after he left home and it was taken for granted that he had perished, under an assumed name, when the Maine went down. While he was mourned as lost he spent twenty years in thrilling experiences in all parts of the globe.

He served two enlistments in the navy, later going on a whale hunt in the South Seas. He became a licensed sea captain and travelled to all ports. Since 1905 he spent most of his time in trips around the world. For several months past he was in Europe and spent some time in France.

The other day Nelson astounded his brother, William Nelson, of Patterson, N. J., when he walked into the latter’s place of business in that city, and after saluting him in a familiar way, asked if he had ‘‘forgotten’’ him.
