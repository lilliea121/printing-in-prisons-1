IS THE WHALE COMING BACK?

Despatches of the recent capture of three sperm whales by Gray’s Harbor hunters serve as a reminder that the ancient industry in whaling has undergone a noteworthy revival in the last few years. It is an interesting fact that the revival has been due largely to the development of the battleship, one of the most modern creations of man.

Hundreds of whalers from American ports sailed the seas, in the times before the Civil War, when whale oil was used for lighting. The discovery of petroleum caused a slump in the industry. Historic New Bedford and Nantucket became the boneyards of a once mighty fleet, and the race of hardy American mariners developed by whaling became almost extinct. The old romances passed into tradition.

But as ships, and particularly battléships, grew in size and number, it was found that for use in certain of the bearings in their pondrous engines there was nothing that would quite take the place of ‘‘case oil,” found in the head of sperm whale, which is strangely clear and does not disintegrate under great pressure and heat. So whalers began to take to the sea again. They are as primitive as those of the older generation, but their cargoes are more than ever in demand.
