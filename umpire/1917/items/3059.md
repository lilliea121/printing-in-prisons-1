KEEP CLIMBING

Although your chance in life seems small, 
Rough the path and dark,
Don’t worry that you’re going to fall, 
But get a firmer start.
Slowly trudge on toward the goal, 
Keep headed the right way,
Remember you can never win 
Life’s battle in a day.
Like climbing up the ladder, 
Ascending step by step,
Keep your aim the highest 
Lest your mission you forget.
When at last the top is gained, 
Thank God the task is done; 
Look back upon the steps you’ve climbed. 
The battle nobly won.
