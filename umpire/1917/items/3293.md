OWNERLESS ISLANDS

Spitzbergen, which is one of the few parts of the globe over which no nation claims effective rights, is reallynot one island, but an archipelago of five islands, and the actual right of discovery belongs to the Dutch, who set foot there in 1596, though the mariners of James I made a more effective landing. One of the difficulties in taking possession lies in the fact that there is practically no regular and permanent population, though the islands are well known by Russian and Norwegian hunters of walruses during a few weeks of the year. Beyond that it is a dreary and inhospitable land, and we certainly should not find it worth while to risk discussion by taking possession.
