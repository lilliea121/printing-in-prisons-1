28,000 MEN CALLED FOR EXAMINATION IN PHILA.

According to the latest reports there will be 28,000 men called by draft to be examined for the army, and from that number the lo- cal examining boards will select 14,250 men for service in the ranks.

It is uncertain when the final call for the selected men will be issued, as each exemption board must receive from Washington an official copy of the draft before final steps are taken for actual work.

The men called in each district will depend upon the number required from the district; the official quotas for each of the various districts, it is expected, will be announced by the Governor within the next few days.
