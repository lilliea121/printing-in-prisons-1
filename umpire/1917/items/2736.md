FLAG DAY

Tomorrow will be Flag Day, and it will be generally observed in all the states of the Union. The occasion will be marked by a keen sense of loyalty, sacrifice and courage, and with faith in the great future of our glorious country.

The first flag of the United Stales was raised by Washington at Cambridge, Mass., on January 2, 1776, and consisted of thirteen stripes, alternate red and white, with a blue canton emblazoned with the crosses of St. George and St. Andrew, similar to the British flag. Congress changed it in 1776, so that the red and white stripes should have the blue canton with thirteen white stars in place of the crosses.

Our flag of today is practically the same as the original one adopted in June, 1776, ex- cept that the thirteen stars have increased to forty-eight. It has been said of our flag that it stands for all that is noblest, beautiful and good, and that it has inspired the noblest deeds recorded in history by its loyal supporters in the past. ‘‘Long may it wave over the land of the free and the home of the brave.’’
