BREAD UPON THE WATERS

Please do not say any more that dough cast upon the hoboes will not return after many days. The contrary has been proved, says a writer in the Evening Telegraph. All scepticism on that score has been effectively ex- ploded, and Mrs. Mattie Hannum, of Vincennes, Ind; has a fine $27,000 lump of the dough commodity to back up the time-honored axiom.

Thirty years ago a tramp timidly knocked on Mattie’s back door and asked for bread. Instead of calling Towser or exercising the garden hose, as some people are wont to do, the kindly housewife obliged with a sandwich from the best loaf in her larder and a cup of coffee to match.

Even as the bread entered the tramp’s mouth it also become impressed on his mind, and he never forgot it. A short time ago he died, and all of the $27,000 he had garnered in the intervening years was placed in the hand that had fed him.

And yet it might be well to hesitate before trying to emulate the good woman’s beautiful heart. The daily average is about twelve hoboes for every back door during the hunger season, and it is quite likely that one would have to give away much more than $27,000 in bread before finding another tramp like Mattie’s.
