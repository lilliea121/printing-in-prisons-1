INSULATING ALUMINUM

It is announced that two employes of the Westinghouse Company have perfected an insulating skin for aluminum so thin and flexible as to make small aluminum wire as economical of space in coils as copper. According to the Engineering News, they have produced two kinds of films. One is smooth and iridescent; the other, white and abrasive. Of these, the second is the better, for it is only .0001 to .0004 of an inch thick, and stands from two hundred to five hundred volts. Two wires can be pressed together until they are indented without breaking the film; but rubbing will expose the metal, and make a short circuit. The film is fireproof, andhasmeachanicalstrength enough to support the wire in small coils above the melting point. To coat the wire with the film, it is passad through electrolytic baths (solutions of borax, ammonium borate, or sodium silicate) â€”a process in which the wire itself acts as the anode.
