THE TREMBLING ASPEN

It is easy to distinguish this tree from its neighbors in the woods. It is also easy to find it. Watch a myriad of shiny green and yellow leaves trembling and shaking like a man with the ague. There may not be a breath of wind stirring; at least none that you can notice, says a writer in Nature. Leaves on other trees are as still and motionless as though they were dead. Yet this tree is all a-flutter from base to top. It is the aspen; also called quaking asp. You’ll want to know why it is seldom ever still. Break off a branch and examine the leaves. You’ll find that the stems are flat and the flat surface joins the blade of the leaf at right angles. Thus there are four flat surfaces to catch the slightest breeze, and the aspen tree is continually trembling. The aspen is a slender tree and grows from forty to eighty feet high. Its bark is rough and dark at the base of the trunk. The upper part of the tree is a pale greenish brown, or nearly white. The poplar tree belongs to the same family, but the leaves of the poplar have round stems. In May the seeds of the aspen ripen. They are oblong and covered with long white hairs. The wind picks them up like little balloons and scatters them broadcast.
