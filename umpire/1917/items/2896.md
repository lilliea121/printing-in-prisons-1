DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THE WAR

The only man in the world who didn’t know there is a war being fought has been discov- ered, says a writer in a Detroit paper.

He is Herman Rimar, twenty-five years old, by profession a dock walloped, otherwise known as a wharfrat.

Rimar was arrested by detectives recently because he could not produce a registration card.

‘‘Registration card—for what?’’ he inquired blankly when the demand was made of him.

“‘For military service,’”’ said the detectives.

‘‘Military service—registration what’s all that to me?’’ asked Rimar.

‘‘Didn’t you know you had to register for the war?’’ demanded the officers testily.

‘“The war—what war? I didn’t know there was a war on,’’ insisted Rimar.

Rimar seemed stunned, not so much by his arrest as by the shock of learning suddenly about all this bloodshed in Europe. However, he’s still in jail.
