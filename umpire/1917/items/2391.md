Opposes Strike LegislationAt a recent hearing of the Public Service Commission, Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, told the members that it was impossible, even by legislation, to prevent strikes. The commis- sion is considering a plan devised by Oscar Straus to found a wage board for the settle- ment of disputes between traction companies and their employees.''Make your wage board a voluntary one and I am with you heart and soul," Gompers said, "but make it a creature of the law and we will oppose you. Should you succeed in having it become a law, we will fight you in the courts, and should the courts uphold the law, still we will exercise our God-given right to cease work when we will, for any reason or for no reason.''
