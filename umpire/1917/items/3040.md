GOOD ADVICE TO BOYS

A prominent educator avers that every boy should finish his school course. We shall secure more men under the draft than we can arm at the present time.

The individual obligation on the part of each and every citizen for service is manifest, but boys should remember that they are now serving in the best possible wey by preparing themselves to serve more efficiently when the time comes. What we want now is for the boy in school or college to finish his education in order that we may have each year a dependable output of well-educated and well-trained young men.

It is a great mistake for partly educated young men to rush to the colors now. We donâ€™t need them. It is very important they should finish their education.
