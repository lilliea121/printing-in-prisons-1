PITCAIRN ISLAND Like many other names seldom heard of in the ordinary course of events, the mention of Pitcairn Island has been brought to notice as a result of the European war. The island is located in latitude 25 degrees 3 minutes south and longitude 130 degrees 6 minutes west, or almost exactly south of Vancouver Island, and just a little south of the tropic of Capricorn. It was first settled in 1790 by nine mutineers from the English ship Bounty and eighteen natives of Tahiti. By the year 1808, when the island was discovered by the English, the population had grown to sixty-six persons, who formed a model community under the patriarchal government of John Adams, the only surviving mutineer, who had saved a Bible from the ship and was ruling with wisdom and justice his little kingdom of slightly over two miles in length. The island now has over 200 population.
