ON THE BRINK

Yea, there is still one step to take 
Before the last,
One word to say before I break 
Quite with the past.

I have gone on it seems 
An endless way—
Running by night through dreams and dreams, 
But barred by day.

The gulf I can not overlap, 
To reach your side,
In my confused and troubled sleep 
Seems half as wide.

For then you bend to me again,
And softly call,
And I forget the ceaseless pain, 
The shame and all.

I see the light upon your face 
As once it shone,
Though I shall never see the place 
Where you have gone.

So hopeless is it now to think 
The time may be
When that dark hour from which I shrink 
Shall pass from me.

And yet while fate forgets to cut 
This mortal breath,
Before the door of life is shut 
By jealous death.

Before I drink the dregs of woe— 
Yea, while I live— 
O loved so vainly, let me know 
That you forgive!
