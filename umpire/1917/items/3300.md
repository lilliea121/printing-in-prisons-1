DREADED MARSHES OF SIBERIA

The largest extent of marsh land in the world is to be found in the lowlands which form part of the steppe of Baraba, between the rivers Intish and Obi, in Asiatic Russia.

The region is flat and covered with forest, salt lakes and quivering marshes. extending over an area which is not less than 100,000 square miles. During the summer dense clouds of mosquitoes float over the treach- erous ground. Immense areas of these dreaded urmans have never been visited by man. The marshes, treacherously concealed under a swaying layer of grassy vegetation, can only be crossed by means of a kind of snowshoe in winter except at the peril of oneâ€™s life.
