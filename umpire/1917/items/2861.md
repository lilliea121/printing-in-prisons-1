THE THOUGHT GARDEN.

A Thought is but a Seed deep in the Mind
That, if you cultivate it, you will find
Will bloom in some achievement, ill or glad,
According as the Seed is good or bad;
A Thought of Joy will fill your day of Peace,
And give your Soul from darkness quick release;
A Thought of Meanness, or of Evil Deeds,
Will fill your inner Garden full of Weeds,
And choke the Blooms that might be blossoming
Like fragrant bowers in the early spring.

â€”John Kendrick Bangs.
