COMPENSATION FOR PRISON LABOR

The fact that a man is a convict and is confined within the four walls of a prison should not in ‘any way alter the economic status of the product of his labor, says a writer in the O. E. L. Critic. The finished article, a pile of broken stone, a pair of shoes, a ball of twine, is something that has a distinct value in itself which is entireiy apart from the personal character of the man who made it; it has no connection with the fact that he who produced it is working in confinement and under guard and is unable to go home at night. Discrimination against prison goods, as such, is therefore unreasonable. An article honestly and faithfully made in prison is just as good as one made by a free laborer who has never broken a law and it is much better than one dishonestly made, with materials and workmanship not up to claims.

It is a hopeful sign that under modern methods the old system of prison slave labor is being done away with, and many of the states have made provision of some kind for compensating prisoners for at least part of the labor they perform while confined. In the Indiana State Reformatory, for instance, all of the men employed in the hollow ware factory are credited with full union wages. Two-thirds of this is deducted for their sub- sistence and supervision, and the rest is paid to their dependents or given to the prisoner himself on his release. This gives a man a little capital to tide him over when he starts his fight to ‘‘beat back,’’ or in the case of a man who has a family depending on him, it keeps the home from being broken up and possibly his children being placed in asylums, and gives him one of the greatest steadying influences he could have on his release. That is, a home to go to, at a time when he needs every possible encouragement in bis efforts to make good. It will only be a matter of time when the people will realize that in taking a year, or several years of labor without compensation, from a man who has broken some law, they are not benefiting themselves, but are leaving him poor indeed. The usual five dollars and a suit of clothes given a released prisoner, will not carry a man very far in these days of high cost of living.

By every law of right and justice, a man who has paid the penalty for his misdeeds, and Lord knows the penalty is heavy enough, should be given an even break. This he emphatically is not getting when he is turned out after a year or more of work performed for the state with only five dollars in his pocket with which to face a hostile world.

This institution, and those at Chehalis and Walla Walla, could furnish most of the sup- plies, such as mattresses, printing, furniture and machine work used in the other insitutions and offices of the state. By selling these articles to the other institutions, at current market prices, a fund could be created from which a released man could be paid a sum corresponding to the amount and value of the work he has done. With an allowance of even fifty cents a day, a man would have enough money on his release to give him a decent start in life.

This would not envolve a cent of extra expense to the tax-payers, as supplies must be purchased somewhere. As these articles would be under constant state supervision during manufacture, a uniform quality of supplies would be insured. The cost of sending men back to penal institutions, who fell again through becoming penniless, would be saved to the state, and in this aspect alone the compensation system would show a cash profit for the first year.
