CAGE ABOLISHED FROM COURTROOM

It is very gratifying to learn of the passing away of ‘‘the cage’’ from the Qurater Sessions courtroom at the City Hall in this City. It was a relic of barbarism thatshould have been abolished long ago, as it was not in keeping with modern ideas of decency or humanity. When the Court of Quarter Sessions was formally opened last week with the presentation to the court of a beautiful American flag, a gift from the court attaches addresses were made by Assistant District Attorney Maurice J. Speiser, Court Clerk James A. Flaherty and Judge John M. Patterson.

In his address Judge Patterson said:

“Heretofore the prisoners were herded in a cage like wild beasts and subjected to the gaze of the mordid, curious and idle public.

“Now thebarbarous methods of earlier ages in keeping the accused in an individual barred box or cage have been supplanted by the more modern idea of what is due a prisoner until he is found guilty. Hereafter a prisoner will be afforded the same fair privileges given defendants in the bail court, who are not required to sit caged up during the hearing of the offenses charged against them.”

It has been the practise in this branch of the criminal court to keep the prisoners herded in a steel cage in the corner of the room.

Now the prisoners are detained in a small room above the court chamber until their cases are called.
