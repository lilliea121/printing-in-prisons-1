FOOTING UP JOY, NOT DOLLARS

“The best kind of social ‘uplift’ would be something that made people happier. The real uplift is of the soul, not of the body,”’ says Thomas Whitney Surette in ‘‘Music and Life.” Social workers and those who really desire to help the poor may gain valuable suggestions from the chapter on “Community Music’’ in Mr. Surette’s book. ‘‘In what are called ‘the slums’ of the greatest American and English cities,” he says ‘I have seen hundreds and even thousands of poor people listening to the music of Beethoven in rapt and tense silence. Imagine a small opera house in the lower East Side of New York or in the North End or South End of Boston which the people there might frequent at sums within their means. I am familiar with the old argument that concerts and opera so conducted would not pay. To thisI reply that it is probably true. Does settlement work pay? Does a library pay? Does any altruistic endeavor anywhere pay? No; nothing of this sort ever shows a money balance on the right side of the ledger. It foots up in joy, not dollars.
