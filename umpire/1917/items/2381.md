The Fellow Who's CleanMy Friend, as through life you are jogging along, be careful your balance-wheel doesn't go wrong. Old Mister Temptation is ever on hand to whisper his promises, gilded and grand. He'll walk by your side till you're firm in his grip; he'll charm you and soon you can't give him the slip. Remember, my friend, ere your future is wrecked, there's nothing on earth like a man's self-respect.The man who can face the whole world with a smile and tell 'em just where they may go is worth while. He knows, in his record, there isn't a dent. He's rich, though he may not possess a, red cent. This sounds rather preachy, but what if it does? It carries a thought that you'd better let buzz around in your brain; it's a cinch it's correct. There's nothing on earth like a man's self-respect.-Bill Dudley.
