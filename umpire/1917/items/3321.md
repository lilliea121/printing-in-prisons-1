OLD VIRTUES THAT SHOULD LIVE

The old-fashioned virtues are not out of date; they’ll never relapse to abandoned estate. The records will show you that honesty pays, as much as it didin the halcyon days, says the Boston Post. Aund industry brings reputation and seeds, the same as it did in the time of our dads. Sobriety helps us to lay up a wad, the larder to fill when the wolf is abroad. Thesilver tongued speakers are jaunting around, and filling the air with a riot of sound, instructing the people just how they should vote, if they would be sure of retaining their goat; they’re talking of creeds and isms and things, and nothing of value the spell-binder brings. The world would be better if speakers would boom the old-fashioned virtues, and keep them in bloom, and say to the people, “Don’t worry, don’t fret, be honest and sober and keep out of debt.” Oh, that is the counsel the plain people need; it’s better than platitudes going to seed. The old-fashioned virtues much sustenance give; when they are adhered to, they teach us to live; and when we are ready murmur good-by, they show us how sportsmanlike delegates die.
