THE LAND OF BEGINNING AGAIN

I wish that there were some wonderful place 
Called the Land of Beginning Again,
Where all our mistakes, and all our heartaches, 
And all of our poor selfish grief
Could be dropped like a shabby old coat at the door, 
And never put on again.

I wish we could come on it all unaware, 
Like the hunter who finds the lost trail; [done
And I wish that.the one whom our blindness had 
The greatest injustice of all
Could be at the gates, like an old friend that waits, 
For the comrade he’s gladdest to hail.

We would find all the things we intended to do,
But forgot, and remembered too late;
Little praises spoken, little promises broken, 
And all of the thousand and one
Little duties neglected that might have perfected 
The day for one less fortunate.

It wouldn’t be possible not to be kind 
In the Land of Beginning Again; 
And the ones we misjudged 
And the ones whom we grudged 
Their moment of victory here, 
Would find in the grasp of our loving handclasp 
More than penitent lips could explain.

For what had been hardest we’d known had been best, 
And what had seemed loss would be gain; 
For there isn’t a sting that will not take wing 
When we’ve faced it and laughed it away; [after 
And I think that the laughter is most what we’re 
In the Land of Beginning Again.

So I wish that there were some wonderful place 
Called the Land of Beginning Again, 
Where all our mistakes and all our heartaches, 
And all of our poor selfish grief 
Could be dropped like a shabby old coat at the door, 
And never put on again.
