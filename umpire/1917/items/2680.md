ELIMINATING THE LOAFERS

Cleveland has eliminated the corner lounger by placing under arrest all persons found hanging around public buildings and street corners, who are unable to give a satisfactory account of themselves. It would seem that other cities could follow this precedent with advantage. The Plain Dealer pressed this matter until decisive action resulted, and in a recent article declared that the street loafer needed drastic treatment.

“He is a simpler problem than many of the municipal worriments. He will not, however, succumb to mere moral suasion. A sojourn in confinement is more effective than a slap on the wrist. Suppression of the street idlers is no easy task, but no community can afford to neglect it. The law-abiding public, as well as the police and the courts, have a duty in this direction. The menace of street loafing can be removed if a community sets its hand to the task. The only men unable to secure emyloyment in these days are the unemployable.”
