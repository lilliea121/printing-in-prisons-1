MANY COLORADO PRISONERS TO BE GIVEN LIBERTY

Late news accounts from Denver, Col., announces that the State Board of Pardons have decided to release on parole or pardon every prisoner in that state not guilty of too heinous a crime or serving a life sentence, in order that their services may be utilized to relieve the seriouslabor stringency in that section. This will be a true Thanksgiving boon to a large number of prisoners now serving time in that state.

It is to be hoped that men will appreciate this act of clemency by making good, so that other states may be induced to follow this excellent innovation.
