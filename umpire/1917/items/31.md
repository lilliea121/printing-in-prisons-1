THE MOST USED LIBRARY

Close after the discovery that New York is the greatest city in the world comes the re- port that its public library is the most used library on earth. Its daily average number of readers is double that of the British Mu- seum of London or the Bibliotheque Nationale of Paris, according to the report for 1915, just published, which says that 10,384,579 books were borrowed in the year and that 2,558,717 persons entered the central building at Fifth avenue and Forty-second street. The war has brought a greatincrease in the num- ber of people who use the library for re- search. It has become, the director says, an jmmense laboratory for scientific investiga- tion, particularly to those seeking information regarding new industries.
