DEATH OF A PEARL Pearls are almost the only precious gems which are subject to decay, and this happens very rarely. When disease attacks a pearl it turns color and after a time crumbles away. The most valuable pearl ever known is supposed to have become diseased. It belonged to a Russian millionaire who kept it carefully locked in a casket and refused to show it to even his most intimate friends. One day some jewel experts prevailed upon him to let them see the most precious gem. When he opened the casket he was dismayed to find that the pearl had been attacked by disease and was already changing color. Soon afterward a heap of white powder was all that remained of the jewel.
