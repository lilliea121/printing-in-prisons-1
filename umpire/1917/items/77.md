GRAND JURY INDICTS FOUR POLICEMEN

The Grand Jury indicted four policemen on Friday last, for ‘‘beating up’’ two helpless prisoners on Thanksgiving Day.

The prosecutors are Ivy Harris, a sailor on the battleship South Carolina and Walter Hildebrand, an employe of a powder plant. After their arrest they allege that they were beaten in the station house. The policemen were held under $800 bail for trial.
