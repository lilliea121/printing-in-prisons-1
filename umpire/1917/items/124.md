SUNDAY’S SONG SERVICE

An afternoon song service of sacred music by members of the choir of St. Mathias P. E. church, was the principal feature of .the religious services at this institution on Sun- day last.

The selections rendered were from the Episcopal hymnal and the choir evinced their aptitude to produce excellent results in sing- ing sacred hymns with musical sweetness and fine eveness of voice control.

This was especially noticeable at times when the bass and tenor parts were given sepa- rately. In all a clever rendition of secular music, most pleasing to the inmate popula- tion.
