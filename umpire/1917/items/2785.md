DEVELOPING ALASKA

John Noon, of Seward, Alaska, talking in New York the other day, declared that a vast empire is now in the making in Alaska. Gold mining is proceeding on an extended scale, he says, and many men are making fortunes Coal deposits are being uncovered and agricultural possibilities, especially in Matanuska Valley, are being exploited profitably. In this valley last year 2000 tons of farm products were raised and sold at good prices. In 1916 potatoes brought $47.00 a ton for home consumption and butter 50 cents a pound. In Tanana district the 1916 production of agricultural articles reached 7000 tons, all sold locally.
