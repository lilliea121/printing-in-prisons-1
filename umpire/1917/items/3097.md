COLUMBUS DAY NEAR

Columbus Day will be generally observed throughout the State on Friday, October 12.

The Knights of Columbus and a number of Italian societies have mapped out special plans of observation, embracing a much wider scope then formerly. A big patriotic mass m√©eting will be held at the Academy of Music, under the auspices of the K. of C., to comemorate the landing of Columbus on these shores and to arouse greater interest in the plan to provide necessities for our soldier boys in France and at the training camps.
