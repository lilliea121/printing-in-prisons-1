WELL RENDERED SONG SERVICE AT THE E. S. P.

An excellent program of patriotic and sacred music was provided for the song service which was given by the inmates’ choir and orchestra at thisinstitution on Sunday afternoon last, under the guidance of Prof. A. F. Wiegandt as conducter. The service was opened by all present singing the patriotic number, ‘‘America,” with intense fervor, after which followed the rendition of the remaining numbers of the program.

The singing elicited considerable praise from a number of visitors present, which included a good showing of men wearing the U. S. Army uniform. The service was concluded by a brief address by Chaplain Joseph Welch, and his remarks were greeted by spontaneous applause. The program follows.
