ABOUT LABRADOR

Replying to a request for information about Labrador, an authentic publication states that “‘the soil and atmosphere are so cold and dry in Labrador that scarcely any vege- tation thrives at all. The larch is a species of pine tree which is found in all northern countries, but its growth is so stunnea in Labrador that a specimen found on the most southern part of that dreary land was but nine inches in height and the trunk was but three-eighths of an inch in diameter. A care- ful examination of the miniature tree reveal. ed its age to be at least thirty-two yeare, for there were that number of ring growths shown in its small trunk. The very cold cur- rents pouring down from the north and the fact that Labrador has less sunshine than Alaska, together with several island cli-

matic conditions, make the summer seasons .

shorter and colder than are those of AlaskaABOUT LABRADOR
