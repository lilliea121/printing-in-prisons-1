Segregation of PrisonersAn important and far-reaching consideration, that could safely be introduced into all prisons, is the segregation of prisoners. That it if necessary if first offenders are to be saved from association with hardened criminals, is evident. Every prison possesses its bad characters whose influence upon men incarcerated for the first time, and in many cases for trivial offenses, often prove the ruination of what might have become useful citizens. Classifying men in prison, separating them according to their records, and positively prohibiting careless intermingling of all races, creeds and nationalities, is worthy of the effort. from a humanitarian standpoint. Prisons abound with delporalizing influences, and it is only true reform to lessen evil environment for the marry who are easily swayed. Let us hope this comes to pass soon for the benefit of those men whose first experience in prison is teaching them a beneficial lesson. -New Era.
