THE RIGHT KIND OF SLUMMINGThe "slums" of a big city are not merely a sociological museum for scientific exploration or for prurient curiosity, says a writer in the Public Ledger. "Nor are all the residents in alleyways ‘slum' dwellers. There is quite as high an average of self-respect and decent pride in the little houses on narrow lanes as in the homes of affluence and comfort. But to learn from Miss McCall, the supervising inspector of the Philadelphia Housing Commission, that 65,000 Philadelphians dwell in alleys is to be impressed with the need of the enforcement of laws and the surveillance of landlords that the poor may have the light and air, the cleanliness and the space to which they are entitled» There are many gloomy, filthy habitations beyond renovation that ought to be destroyed at once in favor of sanitary dwellings. There are in some cases malodorous rivulets of sewage flowing past new houses. If the conscience of the landlord is inoperative it must be stimulated; if the city is lax of providing sanitative facilities the authorities must be forced to do their duty by the taxpayer. The right of the individual to the pursuit of happiness and to healthy surroundings for his children "is not to be denied because he can only afford' a humble home. It is not he but the ‘slums' that must be banished."
