HOLY AND UNHOLY RUSSIA 

There are two Russias, as Maxim Gorky has said. One is the Holy Russia of tradition —inert, introspective, long suffering, Asiatic in spirit. The other is Unholy Russia—with its face turned toward the West, eager to make progress and to get results, even though those results may be ill-judged and fantastic. Unholy Russia conceived and executed the revolution. But Holy Russia must sanction it and stand for it, if it is to survive. Unholy Russia is a radical minority. It must work out the nation’s destiny (if Russia is to be a nationand not a mere geographical expression) by energizing and educating the ancient Holy Russia. A single fraction or faction of the revolutionary minority is not strong enough to do this. Union and consolidation are as necessary in Petrograd today as they were in Philadelphia when Benjamin Franklin said: “If we don’t hang together we shall hang separately.”
