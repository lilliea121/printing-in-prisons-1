SONG TO FATHER O’KANE, S. J.

(Composed in honor of the recent golden jubilee of the Rev. Michael O’Kane, S. J., of St. Joseph’s College and chaplain of the Eastern Penitentiary, as a member of the Society of Jesus.)

White harvests were glistening,
And the call found you listening;
When of old you went hastening 
Down Linden Lane. 
Now ’neath its gold leaves for us 
What your reaping achieves for us, Father O’Kane! 

CHORUS.
Ah, ’tis you have the way with you
That makes our hearts gay with you.
Laughing all day with' you
And the next day again. 
God keep the eyes dry in you, 
And hush every sigh in you,
Father O’Kane! 

All the minds you have brightencd
And the souls you have whitened
And the hearts you have lightened
And freed from their pain,
From the past they come winging now;
Their thanks they are bringing now,
And with us they are singing now,
Father O’Kane!

Here are brothers who treasure you,
And a home glad to pleasure you,
And warm hearts that treasures you
Far beyond the world’s gain.
Holy Cross unites cheers in you;
Son and Father reveres in you,
And crowns fifty years in you,
Father O’Kane!
