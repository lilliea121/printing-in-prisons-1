Catholic Services on New Year's DayA large number of the inmates attended the Catholic services at the prison Chapel on New Year's morning, it being the only religious service of the day at the institution.The Rev. Father F. J. Scanlon, S. J., celebrated the mass, and delivered a fine sermon to the congregation on the duties of the members of the Church to their brethren, and the necessity for constant endeavor to attain the true ideal of the teachings of the Mother Church.
