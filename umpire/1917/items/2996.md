CAFE DANCING DOOMED

Very little effort will be required to finish off for all time that silliest of costumes— restaurant and cafe dancing. People are tiring quickly of the insistent end unsatisfactory hodge podge of foxtrot, viands and small talk. Like all crazes which have raged for the diversion of mankind, the combination of dancing, dining and wining has been overdone and as many of the leading men and women have withdrawn from these public shows, their examples will have numerous followers. The basic idea is wrong. There is something personal in the dance and it should be pursued under the canopy of privacy. Without wishing to infringe on any democratic ideas, one must point out that there is something incongruous in the melee, when nice debutantes rub shoulders with women who have distorted the meaning of “\life’s great adventure.’’
