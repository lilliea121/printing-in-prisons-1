SAGE LEAVES

We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to glide well on them

Life in itself is a mixture of power and form, and it will not bear an excess of eith- er.

v % Everything good is to be found on life’s
highway, if you look for it.

The middle region of life is to be found in

the temperate zone %

Why not treat our nelghbors well; as if they were human: perhaps they are. L * W All good conversation, and action, come from a spontaneity which overlooks usages, and makes the moment live.

L Let us not forget that the vari-colored wheel mustrevolve very fast to appear white. —The Ranger.
