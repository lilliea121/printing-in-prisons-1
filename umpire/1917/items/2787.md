BEST TO LET CLOCKS ALONE

We wish persons would cease making us and others impatient about small things. With 4 shortage of the tobacco crop and a threatened baseball strike we have quite enough to occupy our minds without botheringabout this nonsense called the ‘‘daylight saving plan." Some European put the clocks ahead an hour over there, and nowa few in this country ask that the same thing be done. It will get people out of be earlier and let them work in the cool of the morning, say these folks. What difference does it make what time it is if one is ready to get out of bed? The day begins with the rise of the sun and all foolish persons can get up at that time by setting alarm clocks after consulting almanacs. But there are many persons who find a morning sleep good for them; wherefore, they prefer to lie abed, and putting clocks an hour ahead would not help. The sun fixes the time anyway and when it is six o‘clock no man on earth can make it seven by merely saying it it.

Neither can clocks and watches. Let well enough alone.
