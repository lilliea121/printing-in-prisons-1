HOLLOW PATRIOTS

If a man goes up and down declaring that he is honest we instinctively look to our goods and chattels. Yet we are expected to take to our arms every man who bellows about his love of country, says the New York Evening Post. There is a moral in the remark which sensible Americans should keep in mind just now. If the United States sends an army to Europe its rank ana file will not be composed of the men who now stand about in public places pointing to themselves as patriotic superiors. Our first, our second and our last line of defense will be made up of modest, tolerant men who never raise their voices to advocate war, who hoped unto the final hour that the President and Congress would find honovable means of avoiding war. The loud-mouths will always be found in the rear, feeding the fires of hate, far from the scene of peril.
