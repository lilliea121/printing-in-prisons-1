WILL SPARE JERUSALEM

The British Government has given strict orders to Gen. Sir Archibald Murray, in command of the armies now fighting in Palestine, on no account to injure any of the holy places or in any way interfere with any of the shrines. In the case of Jerusalem, which may be captured if the Alliesâ€™ plans succeed, Sir Archibald has been enjoined to take particular care against injury of all kinds. The Christian shrines in the Holy Land are in charge of Franciscan friars.
