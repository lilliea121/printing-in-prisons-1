HUGE DAM FOR NIAGARA

In a recent article published in the Engineering News Record, T. K. Thomson, a New York consulting engineer, advocates the construction of a huge dam in the gorge about four miles below Niagara Falls. Such a dam, he says, would develop some 2,000,000 horse-power that now goes to waste. Speaking of its construction as a foregone conclusion, he says: ‘‘The masonry structure will be about 1,200 feet long and 150 feet high, and will raise the down-stream level of the river about 100 feet. The power houses would extend down-stream from the dam on both the Canadian and American sides, considerable distances being required to accommodate the many turbines necessary.
