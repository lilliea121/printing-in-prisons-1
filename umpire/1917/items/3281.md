WAGE INCREASE DEMANDED BY R. R. EMPLOYES

News despatches from Cleveland O., announce that virtually every railroad in the United States was today presented with a request from the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen and the Order of Railway Conductors for increased wages approximating 40 per cent. The general chairman of both labor organizations were to present the wage schedule to the generalmanagers of theroads throughout the country today.

The new wage schedule is signed by W. G. Lee, president of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen, and A. B. Garretson, president of the Order of Railway Conductors. A request that an answer to the proposal be made to the general chairman of the labor organizations on or before December 381, 1917, accompanies the schedule.

It is expected that the railroad managers and the representatives of the employes will meet in joint session in about two weeks, probably in the East, in an effort to reach an agreement on the wage question.
