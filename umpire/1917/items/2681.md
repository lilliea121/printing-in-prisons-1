A SENSIBLE MOVE

No thoughtful person will question that Governor Whitman, of New York, has taken a step in the right direction, which is both humane and sensible, in arranging for an expert test of the mental state of condemned homicides. As provided, this test is to be made shortly after conviction, and it should avoid such last-hour appeals as that made to the Governor recently, on the ground that a man about to be executed was believed to be insane. The procedure in many states respecting capital crimes is such a glaring exhibition of how not to do it that almost any reform in that direction is to be welcomed.

By his action the Governor has secured for himself, and probably for his successors, relief from the harrowing duty of having to interfere, or to refuse to interfere, with the carrying out of the death penalty in the case of a man who may not have been legally responsible for his crime.
