Acquire KnowledgeThis is the day when character counts. The day is gone when a young man who seeks a responsible position can be ignorant or deficient in character. The youth who is to rule tomorrow is the youth who is storing up resources of knowledge, of self-control, of courage and of steadiness.The thought of luck no longer holds good; a working knowledge must be acquired before useful knowledge can be given. The young man who is looking forward to a good position must be preparing for it by storing his mind with knowledge, strengthening his character by self-denial and cultivating the power of endurance by grimly hanging on to what he has in hand until something better develops. Then if he has the power of application, there can be no question as to results.
