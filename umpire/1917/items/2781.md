THE LONG ROAD

That roads are long to Easy Street, is true —all winners preach it, and if you move on sluggish feet it’s doubtful if you’ll reach it. I see some lads whowork for hire their leaden trilbys dragging: the smallest effort makes them tire, and all they know is lagging. They face their work with dismal croaks and grumblings stale and wheezy; they’ll never bask beneath the oaks that line the street called Easy. The road is long to Easy street, too rough for any telling, and one must tireless be and fleet who there would have his dwelling. Oh, watch the men who there abide, the men who dance and gambol, and vou will see upon each hide the scar of stone and bramble. They met disaster with a smile, their mien was bold and breezy, they vaulted over fence and stile and reached the street called Easy. The sluggard who is so afraid that he too hard will loaf and languish in the shade and cuss his winning neighbor, and each misfortune overwhelms this man with spirit cheesy; he’ll never rest beneath the elms that line the street called Easy.
