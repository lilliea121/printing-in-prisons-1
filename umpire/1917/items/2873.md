THE NIGHT-HAWK

Guard against the night-hawk, youth; 
Guard against her sprightly talk; 
Fear her witching, luring glances; 
'Ware her eye that brightly dances, 
As a snake to hold and charm; 
View such eye with dread alarm; 
Fear her smiling, winning face; 
Fear her svelte, suggestive grace; 
Fear the neck that she exposes 
And the curves she thus discloses; 
Fear the accidental touch
And the thrill that follows such; 
Fear the physical delight 
Comes with every luring sight; 
Fear the dance with such as she 
That will your undoing be;
Fear this hawk inviting you
Like the hawk she waits the cue.
Many women hawks are waiting, 
Hooks of flesh are ever baiting, 
Women free from all restraining; 
Women with no fear remaining; 
Divorcees that know the game, 
Finding life is all too tame; 
Widows, eager to be living,
To the froth of life ingiving; 
Lonely women everywhere; 
Women with no earthly care. 
These are night-hawks flying loose; 
Full of crafty, luring ruse; 
Watching for their easy prey; 
Noosing all who come their way.
They will lure you, simple youth;
They will pluck you without ruth;
They will sink their talons deep
While you sleep your guileless sleep;
They will bleed you till you’re white;
This they do with gay delight,
Bleed your purse and bleed your health;
Bleed away your soul by stealth;
Bleed your character away,
Till you shamed and naked stay.
Shun them, then, these vicious hawks,
Prowling in their nightly walks;
Shunning day and honest light,
Fear, oh, fear these hawks of night. —F. W. B. in Random Verse.
