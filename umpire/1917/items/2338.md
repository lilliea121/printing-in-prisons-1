His Case Spoiled by Hen's Cackle"Betrayed by a Cackle" would have been a fitting title for a scene enacted in the court at West Chester, Pa. Recently Lewis A. Saddler was on trial, charged with the theft of some chickens from Mrs. Martha Washington. Saddler had a fair case until one of the hens was brought into court and greeted its owner with a cackle of effusive recognition.
