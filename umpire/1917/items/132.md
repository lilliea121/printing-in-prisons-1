A CARGO HARD TO HANDLE

: Asphalt is said to be the most difficult car-

go for a vesseltounload. The asphalt is taken out of the asphalt lakes in Triridad in a semi-.

fluid state, and by the time the vessel reaches a northern port has hardened so that to un- load it, it is necessary for th: men to go into the hold and dig it out with pick and shovel. This takes time, and a vessel carrying such cargo always has to arrang 2 for aconsidera- ble stay in port.
