U. S. ARMY HAS 1,074,146 MEN READY TO FIGHT

In a Washington despatch of recent date, a correspondent says that owing to the belief that the country does not understand the real strength of the American naval and military forces, Chairman Dent, of the House Military Committee, submitted to the House for publication in the Congressional Record a statement prepared at his request by the Committee on Public Information from Government records.

The statement shows that ‘‘on September 14, 1917, there were in the Regular Army, National Guards, and Reserve Corps of the Army 78,828 officers and 741,053 enlisted men. In the Navy there were 141,867 enlisted men, 41,473 naval reserves and 14,500 of the naval militia in the Federal service. There were 5,000 men in the coast guard and 6,500 in the hospital corps, meking a total of 209,340. Enlisted strength of the Marine Corps was 29,971; reserves in the services, 1,070; national naval volunteers, 704; retired men on active duty, 14. There were approximately 12,000 officers in the Navy and 1,166 in the Marine Corps.

“This would indicate that on that date the Army had, including officers and enlisted men, 819,881, and the Navy 254,265, making a total armed strength of 1,074,146 men, all of whom are volunteers. Prior to that time there was not a drafted soldier in a single training camp. The draft law was approved May 18, 1917.”
