UNJUST CONVICTIONS

Samuel Untermyer says ‘‘Unjust convictions among the poor and helpless and especially among our ignorant population are more frequent than we care to admit. The most prolific abuses occur in what are known as assigned cases in which the defendants or their families are too poor to furnish bail or employ counsel. They come to the bar of justice crushed in spirit, and, if innocent, in mortal terror of the law and resigned to any fate. Their assigned counsel (whose well-to-do, retained clients are his chief concern) easily convinces himself that he has done his duty to his pauper client if the prosacutor will accept a plea of guilty to a lesser form of crime or be content to recommend a moderate sentence. And so before the poor fellow knows what has happened to him and in less time than it takes to tell the story, he takes the advice hurriedly given him as he stands quivering at the bar and soon finds himself on the way to prison.”

That such a system results in innocent men being branded and punished as criminals ad- mits of no doubt.
