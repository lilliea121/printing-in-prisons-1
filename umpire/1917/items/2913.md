THE "CORK CONVENT"

‘A striking curiosity near Cintra, Portugal, says a writer in the Wide World, is an ancient convent built partially in the interior of an immense rock. The convent is situated in a very isolated spot, and was formerly sur- rounded by a dense wood of cork trees. The convent is known as the Convento da Cortica, or “Cork Convent,” for the reason that the monks’ cells, chapel, kitchen and refectory are all lined with cork to keep out the damp. From 1560 to 1834 the convent was inhabited by an order of monks known as the Capuchins, a remarkable feature of their religion being that, except on certain occasions, silence was obligatory. Since 1834, when the monasteries and convents of Portugal were dissolved, the convent has not been occupied, though it is open to the public, a caretaker residing there for this purpose.
