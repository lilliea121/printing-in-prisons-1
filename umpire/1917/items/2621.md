THROWING A BOOMERANG "The boomerang is thrown overhand. Grasping the small end in his right hand, the man moves his hand backward as far as he can over the shoulder; then he brings it forward with all the force possible, letting the boomerang slip from his grasp when his hand is well forward in front. "Throwing the boomerang is more of a knack than a science. It may be learned by any American or European who gives the time and patience for practice. However, only native Australians acquire marked ability in making the boomerang turn exactly where they wish. The natives are not averse to using the boomerang as an. American policeman uses his night stick. The native has the advantage over the â€˜cop." He can deal an effective blow without being near the victim. "One of the most interesting implements used by the native Australian is the woomera or spear thrower. The spear thrower resembles a rubber plant leaf with its edges turned upward. At the pointed end there is a barb or hook against which the native places the butt of his spear. In this way he can get considerable additional power for throwing the spear because of the increased purchase."
