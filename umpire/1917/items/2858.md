HORACE PHILLIP , M. D.

While it was expected to come, the fact that Dr. Phillips had really joined the camp at Fort Niagara was a surprise to the many men in this institution.

Dr. Phillips has been the alienist physician here and his kindly interest and willingness to help has made friends of all with whom he came in contact. The underlying good-fellowship that always shone from his eyes inspired confidence.

The position he now fills in the army—first lieutenant in the Officers’ Reserve Corps, medical department—carries great responsibility, and no officer can be appointed to it without passing Dr. Phillips. Consequently he will be responsible for all good officers. The best wishes of all are for him and his success in his present station.
