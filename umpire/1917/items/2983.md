Germany, where iron money of small denomination has for a long time been in circulation, is not alone in suffering such a stringency. Russia is having printed duplicates of the Romanoff jubilee postage stamps on heavy cardboard, the pieces to have the value as money of the stamp denomination, while in England also a new treasury note has been put in circulation, value, $1 10s.
