RARE SKILL SHOWN IN REPAIR WORK

A splendid example of the master cabinet-makerâ€™s art of ornate inlaid work, in the form of a center-table, is to be seen at the workshop of B 5735 and B 8593, on the 6th Block, at this institution, where it has undergone a complete renovation, and is now in every respect like new. The table is an antique of unique design, the top of which is a perfect marvel of inlaid work of rich woods, showing unusual skill in its artistic conception and finish. It should be seen to be appreciated.
