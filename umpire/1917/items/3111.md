EASY MONEY

Talk about easy money! Let those who wonder how it’s done consider the case of the two Dodges and Henry Ford, says the St. Louis Star. According to the answer of the latter to the application of the former for an injunction to restrain him from ‘‘reckless and unwise’’ use of the $52,000,000 surplus of the Ford Motor Company in an increase of the plant, the Dodges own 10 per cent. of the stock, owing to the fact that they invested $10,000 in the business in its early stages, at least a portion in labor. Since then they have received $5,571,500 in dividends and their $10,000 interest is now valued at $50,000,000. If business management which produces such results is reckless and unwise, some new definitions are necessary. The incident throws a spotlight upon our newest great industry.
