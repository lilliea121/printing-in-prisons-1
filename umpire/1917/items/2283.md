Starts in at an Early AgeA Baltimore correspondent tells of a twelve-year old Philadelphia lad, who dawdled into a freight car and ''beat" his way to that city. He ran away from home Â· last week and when found was cold and hungry. The police notified the Philadelphia authorities, and the boy's parents will go after him.
