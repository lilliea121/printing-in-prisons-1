The Principal Festival

Christmas in olden days in England was celebrated as the principle festival of the year, the Anglo-Saxon forefathers delighting in the festivities of the holy month, as they called the month of December. At these times the Anglo-Saxon and afterward the Danish kings of England lived in state and were surrounded with all the great men of their kingdom, who were sumptuously entertained. There was also an outflow of generous hospitality toward the poor. During the reign of Alfred the Great a law was passed with relation to holidays by virtue of which the twelve days after the Nativity were set apart for the celebration of the Christmas festival. It is said that but for Alfred’s strict observance of the “full twelve holy days’’ he would not have been defeated.
