OPPOSES STRIKE LEGISLATION

At a recent hearing of the Public Service Commission, Samuel Gompers, president of the American Federation of Labor, told the members that it was impossible, -even by legislation, tc prevent strikes. The commis- sion is considering a plan devised by Oscar Straus to found a wage bozaid for the settle- ment of disputes between traction companies and their employes.

¢“Make your wage board a voluntary one and 1 am with you heart and soul,”’” Gompers said, ‘‘but malke it a creature of the law and we will oppose you. - Should you succeed in having it become a law, we will fight you in the courts, and should the courts’ urheld the law, still ‘we will exercise our God-given right to cease work when we will, for any reason or for no reason.’’
