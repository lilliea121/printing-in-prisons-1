RESOURCEFUL ALASKA

When anything in the mineral line is needed, look for it in Alaska. The wonderful resources of that interesting possession of the United States have been a source of increasing profit to Americans almost from the moment when the land of ice and polar bears came under the folds of the Stars and Stripes.

The latest sensation in mining circles is the discovery of platinum in Alaska by Doctor Herschel C. Parker, of New York. It comes at a time when the supply commercially available is at the point of exhaustion and when operations in the Ural Mountains, from which most of the platinum has ceme heretofore, are at a standstill because of political conditions in Russia.

If the Alaskan deposits ave sufficient to meet the war needs of the allies, Doctor Parkerâ€™s discovery will be regarded as providential.
