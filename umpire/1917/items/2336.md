Concert by the Ladies' of San Domingo ChoralThe Ladies' of San Domingo Choral gave a delightful concert of song at this institution on Sunday afternoon, under the clever direction of Dr. Joseph Burns, with Miss Loreto McCann as accompanist.The program consisted of a pleasing selection of sacred and classical music, which was rendered in a charming manner, alike pleasing to the assembled guests and to the inmates. Judging from the delightful blending and control of voices as evinced by the singers, and the many expressions of praise,Dr. Burns has good cause to feel proud ofhis talented chorus.***PRDGRAM1.
