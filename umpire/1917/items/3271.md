WHILE HOPE STILL LIVES

While hope still lives in the human heart
There lives a germ from which the worlds may start;
To give a life to a human soul,
And bend a mind to attain a goal.
While hope still lives in a human breast
A stricken hero may raise his crest,
And strive once more with a glorious might 
O’erthrow his foeman and win the fight.
While hope still lives in a human soul Be sure that Satan has not the whole; 
’Tis not too late to o’ercome a sin;
There’s still a chance to resist and win.
While hope still lives there is much that lives, 
Is much that comfort and solace gives; 
So, guard that hope ere it wholly dies 
And dead each impulse and striving lies.
