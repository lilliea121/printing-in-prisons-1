"The Star Spangled Banner"History tells us that "Francis Scott Key wrote 'The Star Spangled Banner' on board the British frigate Surprise during the bom- bardment of Fort McHenry, Baltimore, by the British in 1814. When the British at- tacked the city, Key went on an errand, un- der a flag of truce, to the British fleet, but was detained while the bombardment took place. He watched the progress of the fight from the British ship during the night, and in the morning, seeing the stars and stripes still waving triumphantly, composed the fa- mous song. It was at once printed and became almost instantly popular."
