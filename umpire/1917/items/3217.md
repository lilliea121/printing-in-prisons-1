JEREMIAH HAD NAUGHT LIKE THIS

Jeremiah may have thought that he had much to lament about in those long-gone Bibical days, but verily in all the things that tore his troubled heart he had nothing to contend with like the profiteers of the present day!

Much is now sadness, much is woe! The piece of pie is but a phantom of its former self. Smaller, too, are the rice pudding, the beef stew, the ham sandwich, the loaf of bread, the bag of tobacco and the portion of scrapple. A very wilderness of pathetic emaciation.

Barrels, once so rotund, are shrii.king into bushels, bushels into pecks, pecks into pints. Tons, too, are not as heavy as they were by many pounds, and pounds seem to be made up of grains instead of the erstwhile ounces.

Nothing, alas! seems as large as in the old days, declares the Evening Telegraph.

Everything is shriveling up. A refrigerator is hardly needed. A pint can does for a garbage bucket. There is nothing for the hobo at the back door. The watch dog is getting lean. mortal Paul Jones, apparently we have just begun to skirmish.
