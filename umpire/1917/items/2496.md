Arrested for Suspicious Looks Because Vineland, N. J., has just installed 9 police docket that could not be opened in view of the lack of a crime wave, the police recently rounded up four tramps. Four names were at once inscribed on the docket. The hoboes were charged with "suspicious looks" and will have to clean the borough crosswalks.
