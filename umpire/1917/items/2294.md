Should be Enough for AllOne important thing that is impressing itself upon leading business men is the necessity for cooperation among the countries of the world, says a writer in the Monitor.It is particularly necessary, in all trade relations, if the most desirable results are to be obtained. Friction, in all activities, is costly and unnecessary. When mankind learns that there is trade enough for the people of all nations there will probably be no more wars, and some day this fact will begenerally understood.
