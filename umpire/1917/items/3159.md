THE UGANDA RAILWAY

The builders of the Uganda railway had other difficulties besides natural obstacles and the hostility of natives to contend with. When the railroad reached Tsavo work was held up for weeks by the depredations of two man-eating lions, whose almost incredible boldness and cunning caused a reign of terror among the workmen and resulted in many casualties. Their exploits caused questions to be asked in Parliament, and their story, told by Colonel Patterson, who finally shot them, in ‘‘the Man-Eaters of Tsavo,” forms one of the most thrilling wild beast stories on record.
