THE WAR BALLOON

The usefulness of the ‘‘kite’’ or stationary balloon is not generally known. One familiar with its employment says that at the balloon schools an applicant for officers’ commission must first qualify as a pilot of spherical balloons. Then they are taught to become pilots and observers in the ‘kite’’ balloons.

This balloon is allowed to ascend to a height of about 3,000 feet with a wire attached by which it is drawn down, when desired, by motorpower.

In war, these balloons are located from three to five miles from the first line trenches, and from the basket, two men, a pilot and an observer, give the range and results of firing by telephone to the artillery.

On the western front they are placed from one-half to one mile apart, according to conditions, and are provided with parachutes attached to the men in the basket. In event of accident to the balloon the men parachute safely to the earth.
