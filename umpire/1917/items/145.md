HIS JOKING LANDS HIM IN JAIL

News reports that the ‘“United States has

" lost a citizen in Gustave A. Johnson, a Rus- sian Finn who applied in Jersey City for his fi-

nal papers. ‘What is the Constitution of the

United States?’ asked the Judge. The reply

came, ‘Rugged and healthy, 1 should say.’

Johnson also said the country could go some-

where, whereupon he was sent somewhere

else, to-wit, to jail.”’
