SHADE OF CITY HALL NO HIN- DRANCE Â»

The need of better police protection in the neighborhood of Thirteenth and Market Streets, is asserted by the members of the firm of Wertheimer Brothers, who discover- ed Friday morning that burglars had plun- dered their shirtwaist factory at 1315 Market Street, a few doors from City Hall, on Tues- day night, for the third time within four years, getting silks worth $1000.

Detectives said the robbers evidently had hidden in the building in the daytime, and had ransacked the workshop after the em- ployes had gone home.
