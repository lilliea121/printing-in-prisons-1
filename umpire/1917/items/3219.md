GREAT STORE OF GOLD

Never in the world’s history has there been such a quantity of gold under one roof as is stored today in the United States Sub-Treasury in Wall Street. A corridor in the basement, through which little iron wheeled trucks used to roll, has been shut off by steel gates and the gold stacked up for all the world like bricks awaiting the mason’s hand until the front tier presses against the gates. As announced by the N. Y. Times, in that one pile is 1,200 tons of pure gold, much of it represents British coins sent here in payment of war supplies and melted down in the furnaces of the Assay Office next door. Each brick is worth approximately $8,000, and the pile is valued at considerable more than $600,000,000. In a neighboring vault are $6,000,000 silver dollars, and overhead are so many gold certificates that a miser, allowed to run them through his fingers, might easily die of ecstasy before he had finished with the yellow certificates contained in a single one of the many steel chambers.
