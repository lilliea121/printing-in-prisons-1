50,000 MEN WANTED BY U.S. SHIPPING BOARD

All men subject to draft may obtain exemption from military service by joining the 50,000 who will be required to man the vessels which the United States Shipping Board aims to commission before the end of 1918.

This annoucement was made recently by John Frederick Lewis, of the shipping boardâ€™s recruiting service station, 108 South Fourth street. Men without seagoing experience will be accepted.

Two training ships for sea schools have been commissioned. They are the Calvin Austin, a fast passenger vessel recently in service on the New England coast, and the Minnesota, a large passerger steamship from the Great Lakes, now in Atlantic waters. Each ship will have a class of 600 men. As mariners in pursuit of their calling, they will be exempt from draft.
