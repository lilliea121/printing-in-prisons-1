THE THINKER

Wellington and Blucher gave their names to boots, Lord Cardigan of Balaclava fame is commemorated by a waistcoat. Wolseley by an officers valise, and Gladstone by a bag, with all of which inventions none of them had particular personal concern. The Sam Browns belt, which became important after the Boer War, and had taught the folly of a certain parade ground notion of making an ofﬁcer unduly conspicuous, has now become universal. According to the United Service Magazine, it is the outcome of many years’ patient thought on the part of General Sir Samuel Browne,V. C., who was born it India in 1824, and did notable service there both before and after the Mutiny.

At that rate says the New York Tribune, Sir Samuel might have evolved an entire suit of clothes if he had given several centuries of ‘‘patient thought’’ to the subject.
