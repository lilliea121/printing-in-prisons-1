WONDER ISLAND OF HISTORY Sicily's history is as vivid and picturesque, as ferocious and creative and destructive, as mythical and intensely practical as the stories of all the rest of the world put together, says a writer in the Geographic Magazine. And in beauty of nature, of climate, or man, and of beast, the island is a paradise today, whether or not it was ever the workless, painless, passionless Elysium where our first ancestors enjoyed all the good things of life without having to toil. Nature itself, now in the guise of the misunderstood gods of old, now in convulsions or in quiet fertility that science has made plain to us, weaves its mysterious shuttle through and through the highly colored fabric. And men—such men!—tower above their fellows in the story like Titans—Pindar, Aeschylus, Theocritus, Thucydides, Archimedes, the two great Hierons, Cicero, Verres, Diodorus, Hamilcar and Hannibal, Roger the Count and Roger the King, Belisarius, the great crusaders Richard of the Lion Heart and Louis the Saint of France, Charles of Anjou, Frederick II, the "wonder of the world," and Garibaldi. Even this partial list reads like a compendium of ancient and medieval romance and chivalry.
