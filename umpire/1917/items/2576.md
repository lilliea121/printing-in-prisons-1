A USEFUL STORM

According to a Washington correspondent, Professor Cieveland Abbe, the American meteorologist, was generally credited with being the father of scientific weather forecasting. The possibility of predicting the weather was first considered at an international conference at Brussels in 1853, but the necessary impetus to the movement was given in 1854 during the Crimean war, by a violent storm in the Black Sea, which caused havoc among the allied British and French vessels. One French warship was wrecked, and in consequence of this disaster the astronomer LeVerrier (the co-discoverer of Neptune, appropriately enough) was commissioned by the French government to investigate the meteorological conditions at the time of the storms.
