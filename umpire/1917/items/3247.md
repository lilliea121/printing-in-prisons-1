GIVEN LIBERTY TO FEED SOLDIERS

A rather unique condition attending a release on pardon of a life prisoner was brought to our attention by a Virginia correspondent recently.

It seems that on his solemn promise that he would go to work on a farm and would grow enough crops to feed three soldiers in Europe, Sam Glover has been freed from his life term in jail at Norfolk, Va. Glover has served ten years on his life term for murder.

He has been a model prisoner and his release was requested by a large number of prominent men, who were of the opinion that he suffered long enough imprisonment for his crime.
