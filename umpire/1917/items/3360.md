A Symbol of the Sun

The balsam fir is almost known botanically as the '‘Christmas tree,” for when the carefully recording scientist states that the balsam fir grows to a height of fifty or sixty feet, that its wood is used for the manufacture of boxes, that its bark furnishes the balsam used in medicine and art, that its leaves are gathered for fragrant pillows, they must also say ‘‘it is the Christmas tree of commerce.” The ancient Teutons used to celebrate the winter season by decking a little fir tree in bits of tinsel, flowers, toys, ornaments of various kinds, for to them it was a symbol of the glorious sun which they worshiped. The symmetrical spreading and raying of the branches of the fir reminded them of the sun that rose higher and higher in the heavens.
