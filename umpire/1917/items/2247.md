If, as some men claim, that wealth fails to give happiness or satisfaction, why not try the joy of sharing it with the needy-with those who are suffering for the barest necessities of life?"Seek and ye shall find, " and ''all the rest shall be added unto you."No man of wealth need search long for happiness; he can make it bloom beside his door.
