HOW DO YOU HOE?

Say, how do you hoe your row, young chap? 
Say, how do you hoe your row? 
Do you hoe it fair, 
Do you hoe it square? 
Do you hoe it the best you know? 
Do you cut the weeds as you ought to do, 
And leave what’s worth while there? 
The harvest you’ll garner depends on you; 
Are you working on the square? 
Are you killing the noxious weed, young chap? 
Are you making it straight and clean? 
Are you going straight, 
At a hustling gait, 
Are you scattering all that’s mean? 
Do you laugh and sing and whistle shrill, 
And dance a step or two, 
As the row you hoe leads up the hill?
The harvest is up to you.
