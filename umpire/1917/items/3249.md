THE LARGEST AMERICAN FLAG

The city of St. Louis, Mo., possesses the largest American flag in existence, as far as is known. Itis 150 feet long and 78 feet wide. Each of the thirteen stripes is six feet wide. Imagine a plot of ground containing 11,700 square feet—almost one-quarter of an acre—and you will have an idea of the size of the flag. When used in parades it requires 200 people to carry it. But on account of its great width it cannot be carried through many of the streets of the city.
