SUBSTITUTE FOR SISAL

According to Farm and Fireside Charles Christadoro has found that New Zealand flax yields a fiber nearly twice as tough as sisa. and entirely adapted to binder-twine manufacture. “This flax, of which he has sent us a sample,’’ says Farm and Fireside, ‘‘has been successfully grown as an ornamental plant in the West. thrives on ordinary soil, and will withstand a temperature as low as 10 degrees Fahrenheit. It matures from roots in two years, and may be expected to yield about fifteen tons of leaves per acre, equivalent to two tons of fiber.”
