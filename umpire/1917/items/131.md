FARMS ON EDGE

What might be described as farms on edge are the famous rice terraces upon the mount- ain slopes of the Philippine Islands. These farms, in the shape of ribbons for miles and miles long cover sides of ranges that in this country would be considered about right for goat pastures, so steep and rugged are they. The patient island farmers cultivate- every foot of them, however, the ledges extending high toward the summit and covering im- mense areas. The grade of the terraces is skilfully designead to carry the water down the mountain side without waste and without washing away the land, so that the crops are benefitted by a rainfall which would 'other- wise wash away all the soil from the rocks.FARMS ON EDGE
