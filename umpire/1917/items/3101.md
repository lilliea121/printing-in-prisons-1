VATERLAND NOW A TRANSPORT

The great ocean steamship Vaterland, which has been taken over by the United States Government for use in transporting troops to France, surprised American engineers when they proceeded to repair the shipâ€™s machinery, damaged by her German officers. Then for the first time it became known in this country that the vessel had beenoriginally designed for the use for which she is now employed. Provision was made for gun implacements, and the vessel was made as nearly torpedo proof as possible. The Vaterland is one of the most fleet greyhounds of all that sail the Seven Seas, and can easily escape from submarines. There is a bit of romantic justice in the fact that this palatial steamship will now transport Americanan troops to France, with all of their belongings, in detachments of 10,000, and that 20,000 can be carried across each month.
