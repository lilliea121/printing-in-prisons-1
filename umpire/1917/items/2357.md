It Should Induce Peace TalkThere is a prospect that if peace is not soon arranged, ''millions of men will be hurled against one another in the warfare in Europe next spring," says a writer in the Pittsburgh Post, ''that will undoubtedly cause greater loss of life and other casualties than any contest to date should stimulate the efforts to end the struggle Â·by reason. The thought of the lives and limbs of a million or more men who may otherwise be sacrificed must bear heavily upon the minds of all who can do anything toward saving them. ' The world owes it to those millions of men, hundreds of thousands of whom might be slain and others sent through the remainder of their lives hopeless cripples, to see that every effort is made to have settlement by reason substituted. This is owed to the families of those men as well-the world owes it to itself."
