BASTILE DAY IN THE E. S. P.

With the playing of the Marseillaise by Professor Rightly on Saturday, July 14, the Honor and Friendship Club paid its tribute and honoved Bastile Day.

It meant the same as when in 1793, in the presence of Governor Mifflin at Weed’s Ferry, the head of a pig was severed from its body and passed around to each guest, who stabbed the head, donned a liberty cap, shouting “Tyrant!” and among the toasts was, “As France acted to America, so may America act with respect to France.”

Or again in 1794, when an immense gathering in Philadelphia sang the ‘‘Marseillaise.” America has done what she could for France, and it stands ready to do more.

The members of the H. F. C. have done what they could for America and stand ready to do more. We saluted the French flag and played “The Marseillaise” and “Viva la France.”
