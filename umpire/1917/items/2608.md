To THE HONOR AND FRIENDSHIP CLUB (A 8432).

DEAR SIR:

I received your notification of being elected an honorary member of your Club.

Very much I appreciate what you have done, and thank you for your action and the good wishes of your Club. I will be glad to wear your button when I visit you and be pleased to show it to my friends who are interested in menâ€™s work. Friendship, meaning sympathy and kindness; honor, to scorn to do a mean act, are fine qualities to possess, either inside or outside an institution.

Good wishes for you all belonging to the Honor and Friendship Club. I am

Sincerely your friend, 
ELLEN LANE LEAF. 
April 12, 1917.
