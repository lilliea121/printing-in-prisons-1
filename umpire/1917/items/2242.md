Want "Pen" as ArmoryNews reached this city, from the Mexican border ,, that the Second Regiment of this city had started a to transfer its headquarters from its armory at Broad and Diamond streets to the Eastern Penitentiary.The state in the course of the next few years will abandon the penitentiary, according to present plans, and build a new prison outside of the city.It is pointed out that the penitentiary with some of the interior buildings cleared away would make an ideal drill grounds. The Guardsmen are enthusiastic for the transfer, having gotten the idea from Lancaster, Pa., where some citizens are planning to turn the old county jail into a new armory. It is also stated that several members of the State Armory Board favor transferring the Third Regiment from its armory on South Broad street to the Second Regiment Armory and disposing of the old Third Regiment Armory.
