BEGINS NEW CAREER AT SIXTY

A prominent writer declares that it is rather an unusual event for a man to begin a new career after reaching sixty years of age and win fame. William de Morgan, however, suprised the world with a novel of such scope and distinction that it recalled the masters of Victorian fiction, and outdid the classic example of Cato learning Greek at eighty.

Yet the miracle is not incapable of explenation. He had lived for years in an atmosphere of art and literature as- a member of the Chelsea group in which Rossetti and Burne-Jones were distinguished figures, and the fact that he devoted himself so long toillustration work in stained glass and pottery did not preclude the existence of creative instinct of another kind. It was characteristic of that circle, indeed, to find more than one vehicle of expression. De Morgan was slower than some of the others to turn to the pen—a belated William Morris. It would be idle to deplore circumstances. The finished work of ‘‘Joseph Vance’’ must have been in one way or another the result of years of silent apprenticeship.
