Relief for Prisoners' Families Sought in New BillIt has been recently announced that J. Willis Martin, President Judge of Common Pleas Court No. 5, has drafted a bill for introduction at the next state legislature to auth0 1i,.e Philadelphia to make appropriations for the support of destitute families of persons in prison. Representative Isa_do~e Stern Penrose-McNichol floor leader, It IS S[.id, is to offer the bill and work for its passage.If enacted into law this would mark a departure in the administration of justice by the criminal courts of the city. In sentencing convicts Judges are frequently embarrassed in the discharge of this duty by a knowledge that the person is the sole support of an invalid wife or has relatives dependent upon him, who become the victims of poverty. The bill authorizes Councils to designate one of the departments of the city government to have the control and disbursement of appropriations made for the benefit of members of families of persons sentenced to prison who are in destitute circumstances.
