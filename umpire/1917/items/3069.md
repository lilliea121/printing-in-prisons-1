JEWISH INMATES EXPRESS APPRECIATION

The Jewish inmates of this institution were pleasantly suprised by the special concession provided by Mr. Edward Kraupa on the occasion of the celebration of Yom Kippur last week, and they desire to express their thanks and appreciation to the donner for his thoughtful kindness in providing for their needs.

A liberal donation of Jewish bibles was received from the Jewish Publication Society last week, fordistribution among the Jewish inmates. They are desirous of expressing their sincere thanks for the same.
