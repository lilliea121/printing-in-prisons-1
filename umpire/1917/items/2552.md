THE WORLD SHORT ON RATIONS As a result of the great war it is evident that all the world will soon be on short rations, says a writer in the N. Y. Herald. "The great populations of Germany and Austria have long been in that condition, England is adopting drastic measures to restrict the use of foodstuffs, and if these prove insufficient the president of the Board of Trade declares it may be necessary to have recourse to food tickets, as the enemy countries have done. France, which already has taken vigorous steps to prevent waste and regulate food supplies, is increasing its restrictions and creating a national board of supervision, with sweeping powers, to institute economies and regulate the distribution of provisions. With France and England the latest measures are largely precautionary and designed to impress the people with the necessity for thrift, while Marshal von Hindenburg, in his appeal to German farmers, frankly declares that it is â€˜a question of life and death' for Germany."
