THE BRAVEST BATTLE

The bravest battle that was ever fough! 
Shall I tell you where, and when?
On the maps of the world you will find it not— 
'Twas fought by the mothers of men.

Nay, not with the cannon or battle shot, 
With the sword or nobler pen;
Nay, not with eloquent words or thought 
From mouths of wonderful men!

But deep in the walled-up woman’s heart— 
Of a woman that would not yield,
But bravely, silently, bore her part— 
Lo, there is that battlefield!

No marshalling troop, no bivouac song, 
No banner to gleam and wave; 
But, oh, these battles they last so long— 
From babyhood to the grave.

Yet faithful still as a bridge of stars, 
The fights in her walled-up town—
Fights on and on in the endless wars, 
Then silent, unseen, goes down.

— Unknown.
