LET THEM SMOKE

Judging from the funds that are being collected and the enthusiasm at the various meetings, none of those who really wish to help the soldiers are paying much attention to priggish doctrinairism which would ban cigarettes and tobacco generally, says the Public Ledger. 

The medical specialists have, by a huge majority, testified to the lack of harm the cigarette bestows on those at work in the open air in the trenches. The increased and very vigorous metabolism, as the sum total of the functional activities of the body is termed, due to the severe open-air regimen, aside from any attitude of mind which comes from social or physical suggestion, as it were, calls for some such slight sedative as is furnished by a good smoke. There is no argument against it from the point of view of health, and the objections which have been raised are so artificial, so anti-human, that it is to be hoped none who can will deny the men who are fighting for us this little crumb of comfort. Of course, those who know something of primary psychology also know that it isnâ€™t the tobacco as the weed that cheers without toxic menace which does the trick so much as it is the calming effect that comes from association of ideas that a smoke evokes as to the comforts of civilian life.
It would seem as if it were only necessary to state this to have a universal response, therefore, in favor of letting the boys smoke it up.
