PRISON PHILANTHROPY

In appreciation of the kindnesses conferred upon the different members at different times, and the friendly interest exhibited toward the outcast of society confined within these gray walls, Mrs. Jane Gates, a member of the King’s Daughters, who, although young, both in years and uplift prison work, has been the means of causing many men with whom she has advised, with her bright cheeriness, to hope, was made an honorary member of the H. F. C.

As a further distinction, after a member of the Board of Governors (B 8361) had addressed the delegates and with earnest sincerity, his words vibrating with emotion, explained how deep and sincere was this lady’s sympathy and interest for every member and man inside, he then suggested that a further distinction be conferred upon the honorary member and her name be entered in the book of minutes as ‘‘The Little Mother to the H. F. C.” This distinction, with the honorary membership, was conferred upon Mrs. Gates, and all hats will come off to the "Little Mother to the H. F. C.”

There have been many honorary degrees conferred on members of the King’s Daughters and other persons of distinction who have been interested in members or performed some benevolent act for their benefit, but like allmankind, we can havebut one mother, and likewise can the H. F. C. have but the one mother, and her name is Mrs. Jane Gates.
