THE FLAG

Bright-hued and beautiful, it floats upon the chill spring air; and every thread of it denotes the love that’s woven there; the love of veterans whose tread has sounded on the fields of red; and women old, who mourn their dead, but mourn without despair. Bright-hued and beautiful, it courts caresses of the breeze; and, straining at its staff it sports, in flaunting ecstasies; and other flags, that once were gay, long, long ago were laid away, and many men, whose heads are gray, are thinking now of these. Serene and beautiful it waves, the flag our fathers knew; in Freedom’s sunny air it laves, and gains brighter hue; and may it still the symbol be of all that makes a nation free; still may we cherish Liberty, and to our God be true.
