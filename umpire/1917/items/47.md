SWEARING ON THE BIBLE

The method of swearing by the Bible came into use at a very early period, practically with the establishment of courts of law in Christian countries. It was the ordinary method of swearing when America was set- tled by Europeans and was naturally adopted here. Oaths were common before the Chris- tian era, and any form may be used that conforms to the religious belief of the person to be sworn. Hebrews are often sworn on the Pentateuch, keeping on their hats, and their oath erds with the words, ‘‘So help me, Jehovah.”” A Mohammedan is sworn on the Koran.SWEARING ON THE BIBLE
