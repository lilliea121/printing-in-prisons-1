A NEST IN THE PRISON WALL

Pray little bird, why chose ye wall so grim 
Whereon to build your nest?
Why not the maple there, whose leafy limb 
Could offer shelter best?
For have ye thought what other side reveals 
Of grim and shadowy life
Where no bright beam of yonder sun e’er steals
To banish sordid strife?

Without, high in the prison’s ninch’d wall 
Your tiny young you rear; 
While just within, the prisoner, though loud he call, 
No friendly ear could hear. 
Your little wings that carry you afar 
Mean freedom over all; 
The prisoner beats his hands against the bar— 
No help comes at his call.

Alas! that man with soul should crime commit 
And pine in dreary cell! 
While all without is cheerful, bright, sunlit, 
Within is living hell. 
Come, little bird, so free, so happy, take 
A message o’er the wall 
Which may perchance one’s soul-thirst gently slake— 
“God watches over all.”

May 18, 1917. —Mary Allen Caley.
