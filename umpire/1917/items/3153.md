ONE NEEDED FRIEND

One stormy weather friend is worth an army of the fair weather sort.

Few people are capable of a true and lasting friendship.

Resent the statement, do you?

You think you are a friend to several.

Right off the bat, how much would you stake So-and-So who is in trouble, and needs funds to appeal his case?

Would you risk your own position to put another ahead?

Would you risk your own popularity to see another appreciated in a social way?

Are you willing to sit back and hide your talent under a ‘‘basket’’ so your friend may be able to shine in something you can do well or better?

Of course, taking equally if possible, but it should mean friendship means giving and giving anyway as we have opportunity and there is need.

Make-believe friends are worth less than nothing—waste of time.

When most needed they are deserters.

But when you find a true, faithful, staunch friendship looking your way, go out to meet it with joy in your heart and truth in your soul.

And live up to the requirements—although it’s not always easy to do so.
