Shorten Prison Term by WorkIt has been announced that the state of New York has considered an important proposal relative to prisoners, namely, the first offenders shall be allowed to shorten their terms in prison by the work they do, to the extent of ten days out of every month of their Rentence, in addition to the shortening for good behavior already allowed by law.This law, if enacted, will be beneficial all around. It will give the prisoner new incentives to labor. It will make a better worker out of him. It will save money for the taxpayer. It will restore prisoners to society sooner, and thus help relieve the prison congestion. And when prisoners return to society they will be better fitted for the struggle of life.Idleness is the prisoner's curse. The grind of dull and hopeless employment is only a smaller curse. The proposed plan would pay the prisoner in time, the only coin of value to him, and would make his work the chief joy of his life. We hope that New York will adopt the measure, and that every other state will follow New York's example. -Arrow.
