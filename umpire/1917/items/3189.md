OFFERS BOND FOR PAWN

A Harrisburg correspondent informs us that a pawnbroker in that city called up the police the other day and notified them a man wanted to pawn a $50 Liberty Bond. He asked if it would be all right to make the loan. The police said they had no objections. “How much are you advancing?’’ asked a sergeant. ‘‘He wants $30 on it, but I'm only giving him $16.50,” said the pawnbroker. That would seem to beat gold dollars for fifty cents.
