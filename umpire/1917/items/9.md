THE “SICK” MAN

Apropos the latest ¢‘discovery’’ of crimi- nologists and psychologists that the criminal is merely mentally sick, and acting on the supposition by the putting him ' through a psychological ‘‘third degree’” to test the theory, perhaps a few words from a patient would not be amiss.

Taking into consideration the various fac- tors which contribute to a criminal tendency in people, the gentlemen are correct in their hypotheses to only a very small extent. But the diagnosis of the ailment by no means gets to the root of the trouble, and conse- quently the remedy, if there is one, can hardly do/more than benefit the individual rather than the the mass who suffer from it. If the man with a:crooked brain has an operation performed to cure him of his crim- inal tendencies, surely it is a great step in the right direction.

But, on the other hand, if he is a vietim of economic conditions, of vicious and abnormal social conditions, and of heredity, what form of treatment must he receive to be cured ‘and restored to that status in life called Respectable?

Crime, vice, and disease will decrease but slowly unless a sudden revolution of existing conditions ocecur, and then only will the world at large come to a realization that the so- called “‘sick’’ man was merely a figment of the imagination. Society in its attitude and treatment of its members fallen from grace, shows more visible and actual signs of sick- ness and decay, than those whom it designates as unclean, or for lack of a 'better word, the criminal.

It is an inexorable law of nature that that which fails to grow, stagnates and soon dies.

The evolution of man through the thousands .

of years of his existence point to the inevit-
able but gradual elimination of vice and crime, otherwise thelatter would becomerampant and mark the beginning of the end for astagnant, perishing hum-anity.

By sending the unfortunates to prison, so- ciety is taking a middle course which leads nowhere. If the offender is to be regarded as one sick, why send him or her to the cem- etery? And that is exactly what a prison is —the burial ground of hope, ambition and happiness, and the birthplace of wickedness and iniquity. As long as they are conducted along present lines, as places of punishment instead of institutions of education and en- lightenment, so long will the eriminal popula- tion continue to spread and flourish under the gregarious and bigoted policy now in force.

To the normal eye it seems as if prison and capital punishment is a deterrent to ecrime. To those who have used a magnifying-glass in the shape of a term or several terms of incareeration, i3 given a close-up view of the medieval and iniquitous process that reigns supreme.

Let our theorists and so-called psycholo- gists and other ologists begin at the bottom and root-out the evils attendant on poor wages, a grafting and money-loving political system and the high cost of the necessaries of life. In other words, wipe out the present economic system, with its immense powers for good or evil lying in the hands of a chosen few, and the social and political aspects will adjust themselves accordingly. Until that time comes the criminal and penological prob- lem will remain a great one. B 8162.THE “SICK” MAN
