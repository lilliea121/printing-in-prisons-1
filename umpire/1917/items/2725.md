WE DON’T WORK AT ALL

With the present agitation for an ever increasingly short working'day comes the statistician who proves that by rights the American workingman should work only one day, says a writer in the N. Y. Tribune. Follow the argument closely:

There are by common consent 365 days in the year. Doctors agree that a man should devote one-third of his time to sleep and one- third to recreation. Counting one-third of a year as approximately 122 days, we have 121 days left after taking out this allowance.

Subtract from this the fifty-two Sundays which are the workingman’s right, and we have sixty-nine days left. Saturday half holidays consume twenty-six of these, leaving forty-three.

One hour off for lunch on five days in the week make 260 hours, or approximately twenty-two days, which leaves our total working time twenty-one days. But a man is entitled to a two weeks’ vacation in the summer and the six legal holidays afforded by the state, making a total vacation time of twenty days. Taking this from our working time of twenty-one days, we have a remainder of one working day.
