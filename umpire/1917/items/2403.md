OnlyOnly a little tiny spark, Falling so softly down;In one short hour a frightful glare Shall rouse the sleeping town.Only a little spiteful word, A scarcely noted sneer,Finding a sunny, joyous heart, Leaving behind-a tear.-Only a careless, mocking smile, A foolish, ill-timed jest;It quenched the dawning of a love, Too weak to bear the test.Only the shadow of a doubt, The whisper of a friend;It sent two lives to grieve apart, Mistaken to the end.Only a little broken toy, Shabby and old and torn,It woke the memory of a loss Too heavy to be borne.Only the little daily wants Left at the gate of prayer,Taking instead the Â·golden spoil, Won from the Master there.-Selected.
