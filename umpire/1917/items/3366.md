A Legend of Christmas

In sword and sash and scarlet coat 
Upon a Christmas day,
Through frosty woods and hoary field 
A soldier rode away.
She watched him through the faliing snow, 
A young and lovely maid
In milky pearls and flowing robes 
Of velvet green arrayed.

With rumors of the distant wars 
The months went slowly by
Till once again the Christmas bells 
Were pealing to the sky,
And, walking in the lonely wood, 
A bush the maiden found
With thorns as sharp as little swords
And scarlet berries crowned.

She leaned against an ancient oak 
And wove a wreath to wear 
Of scarlet berries, bright and gay, 
And set it on her hair. 
And, lo, the pearls upon her breast 
Were changed to berries, too, 
And, rooted to the oak, a branch 
Of mistletoe she grew, 

When sweet and clear the Christmas bells 
Ring out o’er vale and hill 
The maiden-mistletoe is seen In pearls and velvet still, 
And with her in the revels ruled 
By musie, mirth and folly, 
In sword and scarlet still arrayed, 
Behold the soldier-holly!
