COUNTRY WILL RULE

Discussing the liquor question a writer in the Portland Telegram says, that ‘‘because t12 saloon ca1 not bz raformed from the in- side, and because its menace-to society is steadily increasing wherever it is allowed to exist, Prohibition sentiment is bound to grow. States which have no cities of half a million population or over will go dry soon, say within four years; some of them in No- vember next year. It will not be long, at the present rate, before the country districts will vote the big cities dry.”’
