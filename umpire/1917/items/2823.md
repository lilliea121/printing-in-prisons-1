THE WILD PIGEON

That the wild pigeon, once so common in the United States, has become extinct is one of the strangest mysteries in American natural history. It is a puzzle which has baffled scientists and which probably never will be solved. Half a century ago wild pigeons were abundant in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and all the states of the Middle West. In their migrations they traveled in flocks numbering ters of thousands, and it sometimes took a gingle flock the better part of an hour to pass a given point. Vast numbers of the pigeons were killed every year by gunners, but many investigators hold that the complete disappearance of the species must have been due in part at least to other causes. No other bird was ever so numerous in this country as the pigeon.
