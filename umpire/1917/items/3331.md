7000 SUBSTITUTES FOR FOOD

German ingenuity is again demonstrated according to a recent official report issued by the German War Food Bureau which says that more than 10,000 substitutes are now used in Germany. Seven thousand are substitutes for food. At the beginning of 1917 there were less than 2,000 substitutes which 1200 were food substitutes.
