FORMER PRISONER AT COUNTY JAIL RETURNS $15,000 NECKLACE

A late news report from Chicago states that a rope of sixty-two pearls, valued at $15,000, which Mrs. Charles L. Hutchinson, wife of a banker, lost while shopping, has been restored to her. According to the story made public, the pearls were found by a man who recently was released from the County jail at Philadelphia, after serving a long term for safe-blowing, and who, despite strait- ened circumstances, heeded the pleas of his wife to restore the pearls to the owner. The man, whose name was withheld, was given $100 reward, and the promise of a good job.
