CATHOLIC MISSION WEEK AT THE E. S. P. CHAPEL

Catholic Mission services were instituted here on Sunday last, to continue through the week, under the able administraticn of the " Rev. 1. J. Maguire, S. J. All inmates inter- ested in the uplifting influence of religious matters should take advantage of the oppor- tunity to hear the Rev. Father Maguire in his missionary addresses. Besides a strong personality, his power of appeal andmasterly style of address are sure to make a lasting impression on all who attend the services. Bear this in mind ‘‘ye who seek the spiritual awakening.”’
