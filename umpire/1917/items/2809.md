THE MOST POWERFUL LOCOMOTIVE

Seven hundred, the most powerful locomotive that ever hauled a train, was put into commission on the Virginia Railroad the other day. It is of the triple articulative typeâ€”a type of which there are only three others in the United States, and all are owned by the Erie Railroad. Seven hundred, however, has a greater tractory power than any of its prototypes, there being practically no limit to the weight it can pull or push.

Before its capacity could be reached the draw-bars and couplers of the most modern cars would break under the strain. Were it possible to put them together, it could pull 300 cars, loaded to capacity, and it would be able to push a much heavier load. A conception of its weight, 844,000 pounds, may be gained when it is known that in going from Eddystone, Pa., it had to detour fifty miles between Philadelphia and Wilmington, because the most direct line was not strong enough to bear its weight. The cost to build the locomotive was over $50,000, and it will be used to haul coal in the West Virginia mountains.
