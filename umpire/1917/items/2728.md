DOING THE BEST WE CAN

One sweetly solemn thought comesto me every night; I at my task have wrought, and tried to do it right. No doubt it is punk, my efforts are a jest; however poor my junk, it represents my best. If you, at close of day, when sounds the quitting bell, that truthfully can say you're doing pretty well. Some beat you galley west, and bear away the praise, but you have done your best,— in that the honor lies.

And having done your best, your conscience doesn’t hurt; serene you go to rest, in your long, muslin shirt.

And at the close of life, when you have said goodbye to cousin, aunt, and wife, and all the children nigh, you’ll face the river cold that flows to islands blest, with courage high and bold if you have done your best.

No craven fears you’ll know, no terrors fierce and sharp, but like a prince you'll go, to draw your crown and harp. So, then, whate’er the field in which you do your stunt, whatever tool you wield to earn your share of blunt, toil on with eager zest, nor falter in that plan; the one who does his best is God’s blue-ribbon man.

— Walt Mason.
