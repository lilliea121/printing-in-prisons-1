Shekels and Half ShekelsThe early Biblical reference to pieces of silver do not in the original convey the ideas of coins, but ·to weight, shekels. The Mosaic''oblation to God'' was a half shekel, and the shekel is explained by Josephus as equal to four Athenian drachmae of the value of about 551⁄2 cents in American money. The first Jewish coinage under authority was, it is believed, struck by Simon, the Maccabee,about the year 140 B.. C. It consisted of shekels and half shekels. This coinage had its value signified upon it, ''Shekel Israel,'' in Samaritan characters.
