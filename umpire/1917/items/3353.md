BIRDS THAT CARRY THEIR YOUNG

It is said that the woodcock has beenknown to carry away her young when threatened with danger. She places them on her spread feet, pressing them between the toes and the breast. A naturalist says many woodcocks also carry their young down to marshy feeding grounds in the evening returning before dawn. In fact, they have no means of feeding their young except by carrying them to their food, for they cannot convey their food to them.
