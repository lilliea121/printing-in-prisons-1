THE NEED OF TWO EYES

Because we have two eyes the things we see seem solid and not flat, with the result that we can judge their distance from us with fair correctness. Look through the window at a house across the street with one eye closed; the bars of the window frame will cut across the opposite house in different places. The two fields seen with the eyes separately although in the main alike, differ. When you look, at the house with both eyes open, the two fields seen by the two eyes are combined and the house across the street assumes depth and relief. Although we see a house with each eye, we see only one house with both eyes. This makes the stereoscope possibleâ€”an instrument so designed that the two eyes are made to converge on a single point and yet to see two different pictures. If these two pictures represent a chair as it would appear to the right and left eyes, respectively, they are perceived as one solid object.
