FAMOUS MEN’S FAVORITE HYMNS

Favorite hymns of famous men make an interesting catalogue. Gladstone’s special was ‘‘Praise to the Holiest in the Height,” Tennyson’s favorite was Heber’s “Holy, Holy, Holy.” One of Ruskin’s preferences was ‘‘Jesus, Here From Sin Deliver,” upon which he preached a sermon to some 300 school children, his guests one afternoon at Brantwood. Mathew Arnold’s choice was “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross’’ (Watt’s masterpiece), the third verse of which M. A. wasoverheard reciting to himself only an hour before his quite unexpected fatal seizure. And Henry Ward Beecher declared ‘I would rather have written ‘Jesus, Lover of My Soul’ than have the fame of all the kings that ever sat on the earth.’’
