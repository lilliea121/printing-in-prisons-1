AS YOU SEE IT 

If we assume any mental attitude which depicts the worst of a situation, we are bound to make a failure of it, whatever it may be.

Concentrating your mind on the hurt of a headache or the pain of a cut, fairly makes either one throb to order. Agitating yourself on how you are going to meet the payments on your talking machine takes all the music out of every record it plays.

If you are told that you must have your appendix removed next Saturday, why fill the four days between now and Saturday with dismal forebodings of how you are going to feel when you wake up from the ether sleep? You will have the operation performed anyway, and you might as well come to it with as much reserve strength and buoyancy of vision as possible. 

A glad heart goes the whole day long and a sad one tires in a mile, as has been told us with poetic fervor. But that does not make us work hard enough for a cheerful viewpoint, for the same determination to see the best of life which really makes the best of life a tangible to all of us.

So let us assume the brightest attitude possible, that it may reflect its glow to all about us, and in that way help the weak in spirit.
