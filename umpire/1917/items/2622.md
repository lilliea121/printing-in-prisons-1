THE TALMUD

The Talmud is the compendium of ancient Jewish oral or unwritten law, as distinguish- ed from the Pentateuch, or writtenlaw. Its origin is coeval with the retuin of the Jew- ish people from the Babylonian captivity, 536 B. C. Its compilation in Hebrew was begun by the scribes, and by their successors the work was carriedon till 220 B. C. The Tal- mud is a combination of prose and poetry and contains two elements, legal and legend- ary. Its morality resembles that ofthe New Testament, and its philosophy reminds â€˜us very forcibly of that of the great Plato.
