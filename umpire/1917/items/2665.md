THE ANTIQUITY OF ENGRAVING

Gems were engraved at a very early period of the world’s history. The very oldest specimen of this art in existence is believed to be a square signet of yellow jasper engraved in year‘of 1450 B. C. and now in the British museum. The engraving upon it is a fair picture of the horse of Amenophis II, and the characters underneath have been deciphered as being the names and titles of that monarch.
