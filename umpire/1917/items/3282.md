CHRISTMAS PACKAGES TO CHEER PRISONERS

Good Words, published at the U. S. Penitentiary, Atlanta, Ga., &nnounces that the rules governing the receiving of articles by inmates at that institution will be suspended from December 20, 1917, to December 31, 1917, inclusive. ‘‘This will permit Christmas packages of cakes, candies, cigars, tobacco, chewing gum and small pies to be received by inmates in limited quantities from relatives or friends. This is in addition to sucharticles as are regularly allowed to prisoners.

The same rule will be in vogue at the Government prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, and at the Kansas State Prison, we are informed.

Warden Frederick G. Zerbst, of Atlanta, announced that prisoners who do not receive packages from home or friends may order through the usual channels, such articles as mentioned above." Let us hope—.
