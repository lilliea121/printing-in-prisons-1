NOW FOR RUBBER EYES

A trade journal announces a new use for rubber as one of the numerous results of the war. It declares that eyes are now being made of rubber.

Glass eyes are always more or less uncomfortable, and frequently unsightly, and it is interesting, therefore when the deformities of war are so serious a subject of consideration, to learn that two French workers, Mme. Lemaitre and Teuillieres, have evolved an entirely new method of replacing a lost eye. By the use of a combination of a hard and soft rubber substance they have achieved their aim and are producing an eye that looks well and feels well.
