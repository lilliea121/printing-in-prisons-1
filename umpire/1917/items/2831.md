THE QUALITY THAT WINS

A plucky Massachusetts boy is actually growing his education. At the end of his grammar-school course he took the savings he had accumulated from a paper route and invested the money in young peach trees which he set out on a sunny hillside. The orchard thrived and the first crop is going to pay a considerable part of his freshman year expenses.

He prepared his orchard according to instructions received from the Department of Agriculture, which takesa paternal interest in all young farmers. One of his classmates in high school made fifty dollars from his lettuce bed, while a small ten-year old girl, who had no ground of her own, planted a Japanese cucumber in a big flower pot. The vine grew ten feet high and her neighbors soon learned where to come for fresh cucumbers. Helpful literature and, in some localities, even personal supervision may be obtained by writing either to the State or National Department of Agriculture.
