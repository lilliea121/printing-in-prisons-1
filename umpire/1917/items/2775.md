PRISONERS’ MAIL

Five hundred thousand persons pass through American priscns every year, and the prime scource of this stream is ignorance, says J. J Sanders in the World’s Work. Everything that can awaken their intelligence is valuable, es- pecially familiarity with current eventsand communication with relatives and friends. No prison riots occur in states where letter-writing is  unrestricted. Nothing will make a person more morose than being cut off from his loved ones, and free communication keeps their minds occupied with wholesomeand elevating thoughts.
