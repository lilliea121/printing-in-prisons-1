PRISON COMMISSION TO REPORT NEW MEASURE IN 1919

According to a Harrisburg correspondent the chances for any further action on prison reform measures at this session of the Legislature are very vague, as the Sproul bill, which was introduced recently and reported favorably last Friday, provides for a two-years’ study of prison laws and systems by a state commission, with the idea of proposiug a new prison code for Pennsylvania at the next session of the Legislature in 1919. It was reported to the Senate by Senator Buckman with an appropriation for the commission of $5,000. It is said that the measure is almost certain to pass without opposition.

This bill was introduced at the request of the Prison Reform Association, of which William Draper Lewis, of Philadelphia, is chairman, after a series of discouraging experiences with bills affecting the prison systems, in the present Legislature.

It is candidly admitted by nearly every one in the Legislature, that this state is far behind nearby states in advanced prisonlaws, but the efforts at this time to improve the situation seem tobe generally misunderstood, and regarded with such indifference that it is considersd best to give up fragmentary work and go before the next Legislature with a comprehenisve and equitable measure.

“It is the hope of prominent prison reformers in the state that the investigation to be conducted by the proposed commission will result in the adoption of a new and up-to-date prison policy for Pennsylvania and in the adoption by the next Legislature of reforms inthe methods of dealing with prison inmates which proved successful in other states.”
