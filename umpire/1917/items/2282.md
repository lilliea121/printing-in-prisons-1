Sacred Song Service on the CenterA well rendered song service was given by the members of St. Philips' P. E. church choir, on the Center, at this institution on Sunday last. The program consisted of atuneful array of sacred song well calculated to please and impress the inmates.The singers appeared to be in good voice and evinced a clever degree of fine shading in the various parts calling for careful expression. In all a pleasing afternoon ofsong, and we hope for an early return of our entertainers.
