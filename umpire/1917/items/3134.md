FOG MADE TO ORDER

Fogs are in such great demand in certain industries that they must be made to order at great expense. Cotton, wool, silk, and cordage mills, warehouses, paper mills, leather and felt factories, printing plants, and scores of other industrial works require a uniformly humid atmosphere which is not naturally obtainable. One of the most common means of attainiug this end is by producing fog at numerous points throughout a plant and mixing it with the surrounding air. Popular Mechanics Magazine contains an interesting account, well illustrated, of how this is done.
