PENNSYLVANIA DAY OBSERVED

The observance of Pennsylvania Day was celebrated at the State College with elaborate ceremonies on Sunday last. Several thousand guests joined with the students and college authorities in the festivities, said to be the most interesting holiday celebration ever attempted at the State College.

Pennsylvania Day corresponds to Foundersâ€™ Day which is observed at many of the privately endowed institutions.

A varied program was provided for the entertainment of the visitors, the mornlng review of the cadet regiment of 1500 students being one of the special features.

The engineering and agricultural branches had an extensive exhibition of their handiwork and equipment, which is thoroughly up to date in the fullest sense of the word.
