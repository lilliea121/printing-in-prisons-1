AN ENGINEERING FEAT

In reinforcing the Williamsburg bridge at New York to strenghten it for the increasing volume of traffic it is being made to carvy, a remarkable piece of engineering work was accomplished recently, says a writer in Pop- wlar Mechanics. This consisted of removing a 10-in. bridee pin and substituting for it a 13-in. pin, a feat believed unprecedented. An especially built motor-driving drilling ma- chine was attached to the bottom chord of the structure with its cutting arbor lined with the pin. The metal which the boring bar had to pass through had a thickness of approximately 24 in., while the volume of steel to be bored out amounted to nearly a cubic foot. The work invelved the removal of the old pin, the enlargement of the pin bore from 10 to 13 in., and the insertion of the larger piece. The tusk was made addi- tionally difficult on account of the necessity of opening the bridge to traffic just as quick- ly as possible, and also for the reason that the only connection between the main and land spans, during the time the pin was out, was a temporary wind chord. The bridge was closed to all except pedestrians between 1 and 5:50 oâ€™clock in the morning, during which time the entire operation was per- formed.
