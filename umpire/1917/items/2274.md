Destinies of Life Know well, my soul, God's hand controls Whate'er thou fearest,Round Him in calmest music rolls Whate'er thou hearest.Man sees no future -a phantom show Is alone before him;Past time is dead, and the grasses grow, And flowers bloom o'er him.The present, the present, is all thou hast For thy sure possessing;Like the patriarch's angel, hold it fast Till it gives its blessing.Like warp and woof, all destinies Are woven fast,Linked in sympathy like the keys -Of an organ vast.Pluck one thread, and the web ye mar; Break but oneOf a thousand keys, and paining jar Through all will run.And in life, in death, in dark, and light, All are in God's care;Sound the black abyss, pierce the deep of night,And He is there.-John Greenleaf Whittier
