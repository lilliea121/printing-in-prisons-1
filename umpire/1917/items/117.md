IT SHOULD INDUCE PEACE TALK

There is a prospect that if peace is not soon arranged, ‘‘millions of men will be hurl- ed against one another in the warfare in Europe next spring,’’ says a writer in the Pittsburg Post, “‘that will undoubtedly cause greater loss of life and other casualties than any contest to date should stimulate the ef- forts to end the struggle by reason. The thought of the lives and limbs of a million or more men who may otherwise be sacrificed must bear heavily upon the minds of all who

can do anything toward saving them. The world owes it to those millions of men, hun-

dreds of thousands of whom might be slain and others sent through the remainder of their lives hopeless cripples, to see that every effort is made to have settlement by reason substituted. This is owed to the families of those men as weail—the world owes it to it- self.”’
