CONSCIENCE IN YOUR WORK

The habit of doing what we have to do as well, as thoroughly, and as speedily as possible, without immediate reference to its probable or possible effects upon ourselves, is one which would of itself secure at once the best success for ourselves and the greatest good of the community, says a writer in the Fortnightly Review. It would settle many vexed questions and solve many knotty problems. Instead of this, the common course is to consider closely the comparative benefit which is likely to accrue to us in return. “Where do I come in?” recurring query in American life today.

There are degrees of this calculation, from the strictly just to the grossly selfish. One man tries to estimate the true worth of his labor and performs it accordingly; another gives as little work and secures as large returns as possible; and between these there is every shade. But in all such reckonings there is one important element left out. No one can count up the value of the labor which is both generous and conscientious. Even its money value can never be calculated.

The youth who enters business life determined to do all that comes to his hands as well and as quickly as he can, who is anxious to learn and eager to please, who never measures his work by his wage, but freely gives all the work and the best work in his power, is vastly more valuable than he who is always bearing in mind the small pay he is receiving, and fearing that he may give too much in return.

So the mechanic or the clerk, who beyond even his obligations to his employer or the demands which public opinion could make upon him, exerts himself to make his work as perfect as he can, and delights in the thoroughness and excellence, apart from any benefit it can render him, has a value which can never be computed. It matters not what the work may be, whether it is done with the spade or the laborer, the pen or the clerk, the brusk or the painter, or the voice or the statesman. Conscientious and diligent persons are sought far and wide; there are always places open to them, and their services are always at a premium.

Talent and skill count for much, but conscience in work tells for far more. He whose integrity is unquestionable, who can be trusted absolutely, who will work equally well alone as when every eye is upon him, and will do his best at all times, is an invaluable member of society, and he can not do all this merely from a motive of self-interest. It is the result of somathing more: it is conscience, vitalizing every detail of labor, and raising it to its highest pitch of excelence.
