“VIA CRUCIS”

Sometimes distraught we may not understand 
The ways by which God leads His chosen ones; 
When want and famine stalked through all the land 
Down into Egypt Jacob sent his sons.

They came in need to buy a little grain 
Which Joseph’s care had providentially stored; 
Those guilty ones who bore the curse of Cain 
Bowed humbly at the feet of Egypt’s lord. 
So they whom Joseph saw in dreams as stars 
Did homage to the brother they had sold, 
But slavery and Pharaoh’s prison bars 
Had failed to make a brother’s heart grow cold.

To them unknown—he had the power to save 
Or recompense the evil they had done; 
Like one who bursts the shackles of a slave 
He broke the bonds of hate and mercy won.

So in the realm of spirit we are led 
To stores of blessings God will open wide; 
Yes, even those whose hands are crimson red 
Are saved by Him whom they have crucified.
