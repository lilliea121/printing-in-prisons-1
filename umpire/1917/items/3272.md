DESIGNED ITALYâ€™S FLAG

Not many may be aware that the flag they will be requested to buy today in aid of the Italian Red Cross was designed by Napoleon.

When the great conquercr made Italy a kingdom, with Eugene Beauharnals as Viceroy, he tried to design a flag for it which, while distinctive, should yet indicate by its close resemblance to that of France, the source to which it owed existence. The result was the tri-color of green, white and red, and this flag, suppressed on the downfall of Napoleon, was revived by the Italian Nationalists in 1818, and accepted by the King of Sardinia as the ensign of New Italy, with the addition of the arms of Savoy.
