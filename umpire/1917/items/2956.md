HELP THE OTHER MAN OUT

Did you ever consider the effort 
That some people make to advance?
If they had to depend upon their knowledge 
They could never hope for a chance.
But some one behind them is pushing 
And for pointers are always about,
When you furnish the brains and the muscle. 
Then you’re helping the other man out.

Some day it will come to an issue, 
And another adjustment be made, 
And the fellow that’s now on the summit 
Will enter the primary grade. 
It’s experience, knowledge and wisdom 
That in time will bring all things about, 
But you seldom get much recognition 
When you’re helping the other man out. 

We all need each other’s assistance, 
At some time we all need a friend. 
No man can be independent, 
We all have to borrow or lend. 
Don’t try to impose on another, 
Nor undue advantage e’er take, 
A leap in the dark may undo you, 
Then perhaps you will see the mistake.

I see from my house by the side of the road, 
By the side of the highway of life,
The men who press with the ardor of hope, 
The men who are faint with the strife,
But I turn not away from the smiles nor the tears,
Both part of an infinite plan,
Let me live in my house by the side of the road 
And help the other man out.
