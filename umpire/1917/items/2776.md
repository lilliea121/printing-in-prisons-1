KNIGHTS OF OLD

The knights of the days of chivalry were so well protected by their armor that they were practically invincible to all ordinary weapons. Even when dismounted they could not be injured save by tne miseracordia, a thin dagger, which penetrated the joints of the armor. In more than one battle knights fallen from their horses could not be killed until their armor had been broken up with axes and hammers.
