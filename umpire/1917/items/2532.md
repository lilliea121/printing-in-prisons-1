THESE COUNTNot what we have, but what we use; Not what we see, but what we choose— These are the things that mar or bless The sum of human happiness. The things nearby, not things afar; Not what we seem, but what we are— These are the things that make or break, That give the heart its joy or ache. Not as we take, but as we give; Not as we pray, but as we live— These are the things that make for peace, Both now and after Time shall cease. —Clarence Urmy.
