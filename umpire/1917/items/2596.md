PAPER LEGS FOR SOLDIERS

It was recently announced by a Paris correspondent that artificial legs, made from papier mache and costing less than seventy-five cents, are being supplied to wounded soldiers in Paris hospitals. The paper legs, which are the invention of a Danish surgeon, are merely for temporary use, but with care, will last from six months to a year. They are made on the spot, can be used a fort-night after the amputation, and obviate the necessity for crutches while the patient is convalescing.

A hospital orderly can cut out, fit and complete a paper leg for a patient in about half an hour. The work takes a day to dry and set, and may be used the next day by the invalid.
