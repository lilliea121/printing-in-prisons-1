THE FIRST DIAMOND

The first diamond discovered in Griqualand, South Africa, was found by the children of a Dutch farmer, who for a time used it as a plaything. The stone was later sent to Cape Town, where its true nature was recognized, and it was subsequently forwarded to Paris, where it was exhibited and sold for $2,500. The valuable discovery soon led to other researches, and diamonds were unearthed in various places in Griqualand West, with the result that, forty-six years ago, the country of the Griquas, a mixed race sprung from Dutch settlers and native women, were annexed by Great Britian.

Diamond hunting was at first confined to the banks of the Vaal River but in the year of the British occupation mines were opened in the locality known as ‘‘dry diggings,”’ which has since received the name of Kimberly. In 1872 the world was startled by the discovery of the Stewart diamond of 288% carats. The daily output of the consolidated mines at Kimberly just prior to the outbreak of the war was valued at $220,000.
