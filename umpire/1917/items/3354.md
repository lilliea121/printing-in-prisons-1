DESCENDANTS OF MUTINEERS

A Sidney, Australia, correspondent says that Norfolk Island, which is peopled by the descendants of the mutineers of the British ship Bounty, English sailors who married Tahtian women and fled with them to escape British justice after the seizure of the Bounty, has just furnished several more recruits for the Australian forces. At least four Norfolk Islanders who are direct descendants of the Bountyâ€™s mutineers have been killed in action.
