THE FUTILITY OF WORRY

There are three diseases of the soul; and the greatest of these is worry. On a win- ter’s day at Erfurt, when to the anxious mind of Luther the Reformation was reduced to a forlorn hope, he heard a robin redbreast chirping under his window; and straightway his Master seemed to be saying, ‘‘If your Father careth for these, shall he not much more care for you, O ye of little faith?” Seeing his friend, Melanchthon, near by in an attitude of despondency, he called, ‘‘Come, Philip, let us sing ‘Ein feste Burg’;’’ whereupon two hearts, new stayed on God, gave praise in the Forty-sixth Psalm: ‘‘God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. Therefore will we not fear, though the earth be removed and though the mountains be cast into the midst of the sea!’’

These are sifting times; when men’s hearts are likely to misgive them and their religion is weighed in the balance, says a writer in the Christian Herald. It is no uncommon thing to hear a professing Christian say, in view of passing events, “My faith trembles," or “My faith fails me.” This means simply that it was a paltry faith, an easy-going faith for summer days, a faith that never was securely stayed on God.
