BEAUTIFUL YELLOWSTONE LAKE

Yellowstone Lake, with its irregular shore line and many arms extending far into the surrounding country, furnishes one of the more peaceful views in America’s great wonderland of waterfalls, geysers, and hots prings— the Yeilowstone National Park. The lake is about twenty miles long and eighteen miles wide, and is one of the very few in the whole world of so great an area situated at such a height above the sea. Its altitude is seven thousand seven hundred and forty-one feet.

Among the early exploring ventures into the Yellowstone region was that of the Folsom-Cook party in 1869, and Explorer Folsom of that expedition, set down the following description of Yellowstone Lake as he saw it half a century ago:

“As we were about departing on our home- ward trip we ascended the summit of a neighboring hill and took a final look at Yellowstone Lake. Nestled among the forest-crowned: hills which bounded our vision, lay this inland sea, its crystal waves dancing and sparkling in the sunlight as if laughing with joy for their wild freedom. Itis a scene of transcendent beauty, which has been viewed by but few white men, and we felt glad to have looked upon it before its primeval solitude should be broken by the crowds of pleasure-seekers which at no distant day will throng its shores.”
