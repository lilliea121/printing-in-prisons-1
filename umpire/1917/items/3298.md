CORN BREAD AN OLD TIME FAVORITE

The Government has asked us to eat cornbread one day each week and help save the wheat for the soldiers who are going to flght for us. It’s a good suggestion, says a Kansas paper. 

This whole country was pioneered on cornbread. The Pilgrim Fathers almost lived on it. Corn was the first crop planted in all the virgin soil as it was settled from the Atlantic out across the Alleghenies upon the broad prairies to the Rockies and beyond. Corn was a crop that would grow even in the uncleared forest of the Middle West. The pioneers used to deaden the trees by girding and drop corn in the hills in the unplowed soil and get a first crop that way.

Sturdy men were reared on cornbread and venison. But in these days cornbread has fallen into disuse in the cities partly because wheat has been so cheap and partly because women have forgotten how to make palatable cornbread.

Let the cooking experts get busy now and tell us again how to make cornbread ‘‘like grandma used to make.”
