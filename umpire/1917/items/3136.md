CAT SKINS IN DEMAND

According to the statement of a trade paper New York fur dealers are advertising for catskins. There are persons in every neighborhood who will pray that the fur dealers secure a goodly supply; in fact, they will aid and assist the dealers in securing the skins of a few cats in the vicinity, if advised how to proceed. But that has nothing to do with the matter in this instance, for this is a business proposition and is not influenced by the prejudice against cats.

Cat skins have not been very highly valued in the past, although their fur is good and can be worked up into merchandisable commodities very readily. The skunk skin—and the skunk is related to the cat—brings a good price, but the common house cat has not been in demand for its fur until this time. Now, however, the New York merchants will pay fifty cents for the skin of any old kind of a cat, and a dollar for the skin of a Maltese— and twice as much for the skin of perfectly black cats.

The fact that the merchant reportsthat he has already secured fifteen thousand cat skins shows there is a supply tobe had. He says, however, that there are about fifteen million cat skins in this country, now worn by the cats, but which ought to be taken off and sold.
