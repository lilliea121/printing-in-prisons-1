Most varieties of fish have no eyelids at all, a shiny membrane or a thick, transparent skin covering the eyes and protecting them from injury. The eyes are constantly in use, except when the fish are asleep. A variety known as the puffer or swellfish, which burrows in the sand at the bottom, has eyelids which cover the eyeball when closed, the lower lid being larger than the upper.
