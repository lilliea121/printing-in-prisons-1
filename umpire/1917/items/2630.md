MOTHER'S DAY The people outside these walls set aside many different dates, to be observed in honor of some hero or notable person worthy of the cause, which however cannot be taken advantage of owing to our present predicament, but there is one day set aside by our Hon. Governor Mr. Brumbaugh, Sunday, May the 13th, which is Mother's Day. Every man and boy confined here, as well as those that are enjoying their liberty on the outside, away from home 1s expected to write to his mother, or if he should be so unfortunate as not to have a mother alive, he should at least give all of his thoughts to her on this day. There are some mothers with missing sons who will watch in vain for the postman. The Warden has always extended the privilege to the men who are desirous of writing to their mother this day. â€”B 7685
