"Many a man has found out to his sorrow," as the Penitentiary News says, "that woman is a great temptation for a young man to face in the world today,'' and according to the belief of Jacob H. Schiff, as expressed by him in reply to the public question of Dr.F. W. Adams: "What is the most susceptible temptation to a young man?" Mr. Schiff appears to have a pretty keen insight into the follies of his fellows. Trace out the contributory causes for the downfall of many young men, and you will find at the very source and beginning-a woman! In all the world there is nothing more beautiful andgodly than a good woman, but, on the otherhand, there is no agency of hell so prolific of sorrow and ruin than the woman on whomSatan has set his seal.
