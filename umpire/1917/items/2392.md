His Joking Lands Him in JailNews reports that the "United States has lost a citizen in Gustave A. Johnson, a Russian Finn who applied in Jersey City for his fi- nal papers. 'What is the Constitution of the United States?' asked the Judge. The reply came, 'Rugged and healthy, I should say.' Johnson also said the country could go somewhere, whereupon he was sent somewhere else, to-wit, to jail."
