EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS

Commenting on the good work of Chaplain A. J. Soldan in his employment bureau at the United States penitentiary, Leavenworth, Kan., the Public Ledger says that it has its parallel in the efforts made by humane prison officials ‘‘elsewhere in West and East, to enable a man to leave a prison, as it were, upon his feet and with his head up, instead of crippled to helplessness by his record. A prison door nowadays ought to shut a man in upon an educational opportunity instead of a black vacuum that fills with maddening despair. Many manufacturers whose letters Chaplain Soldan quotes express their willingness to supply a second chance to the man who went wrong. The time is coming when a jail sentence will be the equivalent of a liberal education to many a man who was first steered into wrong courses by an evil coalition of idleness and ignorance. The modern prison intends to redeem, and the penal system has failed of its purpose if it goes no further than to condemn. A man made over is a man ‘‘for a’ that’’—and perhaps a better man than one who needed no reforming.
