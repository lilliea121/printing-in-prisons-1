THE OCEAN FLOOR

The ocean does not sink into the earth owning to the fact that there is a kind of substance at the bottom of the ocean which the water can not penetrate, in spite of the tremendous pressure which the great body of deep water exerts. In all places where the bottom of the ocean has a covering which water can sink into it does so, but there are such a few places where this is possible by comparison, that the amount that gets out that way is not noticeable, says the Book of Wonders. This water, if it can keep on going, will eventually reach the inside of the earth, where it is red hot, and is turned into steam.
