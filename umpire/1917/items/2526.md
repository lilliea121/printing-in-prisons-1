HOW THE ANCIENTS BATHED Ancient Rome is said to have consumed no less than 340,000,000 gallons of water a day, and one of the most noticeable features of the modern town is the prodigal effervescence of its water, gushing from fountains of every conceivable size and design. The Trevi is the most magnificent in the city, its waters (called Aqua Virginie, virgin water, because of its purity) the finest. The old Roman baths required a lot of water. The splendid Thermae, built by the degenerate Emperor Caracalla, had accommodations for 1,600 bathers. Besides the baths proper, the establishment included within its area of about a quarter of a mile square a gymnasium, athletic field, library and even a race track. Its ruins tower above the plain today like some mountain blasted by nature.
