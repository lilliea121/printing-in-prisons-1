Prison Guards Disturbed by Strange Sounds

It is said that thereisa ventriloquist among the inmates at the Federal prison, Leaven- worth, Kan., and that he has the night guards in a state of high nervous tension. So far they have not been able to identify him. Meanwhile the cells and corridors nightly re- sound with wails of distress, laughter, and angry dialogues, seemingly carried on by a man and a woman.
