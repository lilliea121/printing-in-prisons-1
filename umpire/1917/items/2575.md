"It matters little where I was born; 
If my parents were rich or poor;
Whether they shrank at the cold world's scorn,
Or walked in the pride of wealth secure.
But whether I live an honest man,
And hold my itegrity firm in my clutch,
I tell you, my brother, plain as I am,
It matters much!
"It matters little how long I stay
In a world of sorrow, sin, and care;
Whether in youth I am called away,
Or live till my bones and pate are bare.
But whether I do the best that I can
to soften the weight of adversity's touch
On the faded cheek of my fellow-man,
It matters much!"
-From the Swedish
