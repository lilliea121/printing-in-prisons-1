FARMERS FLOCKING TO CANADA

A large number of American farmers as well as a host of foreign immigrants reported as flocking into western Canada in the first ten months of the present year has more than doubled the returns for the same period in 1916, and more than trippled the 1915 figures. The cause is said to be traceable to the belief that taxes will be excessively burdensome in the United States after the present war is over.

A statement given out by the Department of immigration recently shows that 33,134 persons have come from the United States up to October 31 this year. In the first ten months in 1916, 15,960 persons crossed the line, in 1915 only 9,191.
