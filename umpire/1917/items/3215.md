POWER OF IMAGINATION

The Almighty has given us imagination not alone to make some men great, but ‘‘to enable all men to beautify the homely things of life.” It enrichens everything. The humble, the great, low and the high, all possess it to a more or less degree.

If we indulgeit, imagination has the power to make the wildes fancy seem true, or it may surround us with many seeming dangers and unknown terrors. Again it may induce suspicion in a most friendly act, and make the innocent seem sinister. It may cause the most trifling thing to assume undue importance; it may become the very bane of life and add the drop of gall that embitters all happiness. But imagination used adds brightness to a sunrise and glory to a sunset. It throws a halo over a beautiful scene. It makes memory dwell on joys and forget sorrows. It helps idealize the characters of those we love. It inspires invention and improvement. It makes the things we hope for real. It forms a large part of happy romances. It is not well to be given too largely to imagination, but we should cultivate a right use of it. And by so doing, direct our mental powers in a channel that will uplift and spur us on to greater endeavors.
