THE SPEED OF NO RETURN

The speed of no return is that speed which one would have to send a body, a bullet for instance, straight up in the air so that it would never come back. The rate of this speed is estimated to be about seven miles a second. If a bullet could be given that velocity away from the earth it would never come back. The rate of this speed has been estimated to be about seven miles a second. If a bullet could be given that velority away from the earth it would never fall back to our planet, but would travel on into space in an orbit of its own around the sun.

As to the possibilities of anything ever attaining this speed, no one can say. Scientists say that all they know is that the friction of the air would probably melt and then vaporize the body before it succeeded in getting through the earth’s ocean of air. The speed of the modern army bullet is about one-twelfth of the speed of no return, being a little over half a mile a second.

Instances of the speed of no return are seen when meteors fall into the atmosphere of the earth. They very seldom reach the earth’s surface, but are melted and vaporized by the enormous amount of heat evolved from friction with the air at such an enormous velocity.
