Prison Guards Disturbed by Strange SoundsIt is said that there is a ventriloquist among the inmates at the Federal prison, Leavenworth, Kan., and that he has the night guards in a state of high nervous tension. So far they have not been able to identify him. Meanwhile the cells and corridors nightly resound with wails of distress, laughter, and angry dialogues, seemingly carried on by a man and a woman.
