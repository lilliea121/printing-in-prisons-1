IS HISTORY TO REPEAT?

Two thousand years without a peer, conceded even by the Indefatigable Corsican to have been the Master Soldier of all time, and yet after fifteen years of victorious warfare he was, through no fault of his own, compelled to submit. Who? Hannibal? Why? Well, because like a goodly number of our honorable American money-nuts the Carthagenians positively refused to ‘‘kick in’’ with the essential ‘‘kale.’’

This war may or may not produce one or several Hannibals, but the fate of our country will be the same as that of his.

Unless—well, you with the ‘“long ready’’— be it tainted or no—look up; that’s all. Look up!
