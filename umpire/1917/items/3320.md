WHY IS IT?

Not every young man who has technically violated a statute is a criminal at heart; yet, for his infraction of the law in some unguarded moment, he must suffer equally with the one who voluntarily chooses to lead a life of crime and who delights in it. Should not there be some other way of dealing with these unfortunatesâ€”not criminals, rather than sending them to penal institutions,

Many noted criminologists have said that penal establishments are nothing more than criminal incubators. Still those who have merely yielded to temptation in the weakness of a passing moment and who would have done better had they had another start, these are the ones who are sent to mingle with hardened crooks of all kinds. Why is this? asks The Index.
