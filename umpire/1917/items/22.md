OVER 1,000 USELESS LAWS TO COME UP FOR REPEAL

It is stated on reliable authority from

Harrisburg, that bills providing for the striking off ‘of over 1,000 ohsolete laws from the statute books of the state, are being prepared at the State Legislative Reference Bureau, and will probably be complete the latter part of this month. The laws affected are said to include antiquated penal and other- wise useless measures that hinder rather than further the interests of social welfare.

During the session of 1915 an ‘‘omnibus re- pealer’” was passed which would have taken about the same number of laws from the books, but it was vetoed for the reason that there were some doubts about the procedure in including laws of various subjects in one repealer.
In ail probability there will be grouping of old laws accoerding to subjects so that all of the same class will be under a similar head- ing. There may be fifty or sixty such bills, all depending upon the number of bills to be repealed. No attempt will be made to re- peal any bills except those which have been declared unconstitutional by the courts, which have been repealed but not stricken from the

books, which have been superceded or dupli-

cated. The work is in charge of James N. Moore, director of the bureau.
