LOOK AT YOU

You have probably noticed that some faces in pictures seem to follow you, also that in other pictures there are faces which are not looking at you, but no matter where you walk, even though it be in the direction in which they seem to be looking, you will never find the face looking at you. Indeed, faces in pictures are either looking at us from wherever we look at them, or else they never look at us from wherever we look at them. The same is true of photoplays.

The rule is very simple. If the person who was being painted or photograped was looking at the painter or the camera, then wherever you stand he will seem to be looking at you.

If he was looking on one side, then wherever you stand he will seem to be looking on that side of you. This works very queerly if you have a group of people who were looking at the camera when they were photographed. If you look at the photogragh from one side they all seem to turn to follow you and then to turn back if you look at it from the other side. But if they were not looking at the camera, you can never get them to look at you.
