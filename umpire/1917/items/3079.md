AS TO HAPPINESS

It has been said that many people seem to believe that happiness is a thing that you can get hold of and keep as if it were a mere possession or a quality of character. But in reality it is something we have to work for, and to keep on working in order to hold it.

Open yourself to respond to everything lovely or cheerful, to see beauty, to enjoy the society of your fellow-men, to delight in work, and to be enthusiastic in play. Teach yourself interest in the struggles and hopes of others—the sort of interest thatisof use, that is a help. For by so doing we learn to enjoy the many little things that turn our way from day to day. Let us make the most of your own mind, your own capacities. Don’t sit around, pondering whether you are happy or not, whether or not life is worth living.

Let us live each day at its best, live it thoroughly, keeping awake to all the wonder of it, and you will be happy without knowing it, at first, until you have gone along far enough to realize what happiness is.
