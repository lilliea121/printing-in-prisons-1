Judge Patterson Orders Removal of CageThe prisoners' cage in the Quarter Sessions Court is to be removed. Used for more than century in housing prisoners called for trial, the iron barred structure erected in a corner of the tribunal in full view of witnesses and spectators has been ordered out of commission by Judge Patterson. The latter directed that hereafter no person shall be confined in the cage while awaiting trial. In a short time it will be removed entirely."I realize that there is such a thing as being mawkishly sympathetic and, in the name of humanity, doing very foolish things," said Judge Patterson recently in discussing his order. "I believe, however, that the law should inflict no more pain upon men and women than is absolutely necessary for the protection of society. I have consulted with a number of my colleagues and they all agree with me."
