GAME OF CARDS SENDS 10 TO HOSPITAL AND 15 TO JAIL

It proved a costly game of cards when a ‘marked’’ deck was found to be in play in a poker game at Shire QOaks, a railroad junc- tion near Monongahela, a riotresulted. State police, railroad detectives and Monongahela constables were rushed to the scene in an engine.

Fifteen arrests were made, while ten others went to the Memorial Hospital, Monongahela, to have their injuries attended. Three men, who were strangers in the motley array, were charged wich having placed the ‘‘mark- ed’”’ deck in play.

Alderman Elwood, of Monongahela, committed the prisoner.
