DANA’S TEN BOOKS

Charles A. Dana once made a list of ten “indispensable books.” They are the Bible, Shakespeare, the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, Bancroft’s ‘‘History of the United States,” Irving’s “Life of Washington,” Franklin’s “Autobiography,” Channing’s ‘‘Essay on Napoleon Bonaparte,” Gibbon’s ‘‘Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire’’ and Tarbell’s “Early Life of Lincoln.”
