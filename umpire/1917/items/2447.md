Noting the Police SystemWe are informed that C. J. Driscoll of the New York Bureau of Municipal Research, who has been making a police service survey in several states, recently made an address at Harrisburg before the Chamber of Commerce, and according to a reporter in a local paper, he stated that the trouble with the police forces in American cities is that there is "too much politics, too little sincerity, too many commissioners and not enough study into scientific development of the force." He spoke on ''Police Conditions in America.''He said members of the force should be se- lected for personal efficiency and not for po- litical reasons, as is the case in nearly all communities.
