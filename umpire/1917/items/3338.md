TO UTILIZE PRISON LABOR

Senator Hoke Smith has introduced a Senate bill aimed at the removal of present restrictions on Government purchase of goods made by prisoners. The passage of this bill would open a way for the utilization of prison labor in the making of munitions and other war supplies says the Evening Telegraph.

It is impossible to find any valid reason against putting the thousands of men in the prisons of this country at work for the winning of the war. Here is an unanswerable case for labor conscription. The nation needs labor. It needs the help of every available, ablebodied man in or out of prison. Conscript the prisoner and put him to work.

Labor camps, where few guards would be required, might be established. The main thing is to make the prisoner count for victory and to end a great waste of urgently needed labor.
