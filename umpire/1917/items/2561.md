SHORT SKETCHES OF MACK’S FAVORITES

““Ping’’ Bodie, outfielder, married, lives in San Francisco. Played with Chicago White Sox and had a mania for driving balls hit by Mack’s pitchers into the left-field bleachers. He is known as the ‘‘fence buster.”’

Joe Bush, married, comes from Brainerd, Minn., which was also the birthplace of “Chief’”” Bander. Pitched a no-hit game against Cleveland last year. He is an expert trapshooter and can drive an automobile with ‘the daring of an Oldfield.

‘Wally Schang, catcher, married, has been

with the Athletics since spring of 1913. Born in New York State, but now makes his home in Philadelphia. Bats either left-handed or right-handed.

Harry Seibold, a product of Philadelphia. Started his league career as a shortstop. Tried out as such by Athletics two years ago. ‘Seibold then took up pitching in earnest and was a big factor in winning a minor league pennant last year.
