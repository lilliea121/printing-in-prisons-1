CONTENTED PRISONERS

The following letter recently appeared in the columns of the Public Ledger, which would indicate that the great question of outside work for prisoners is gaining the sympathy of serious minded people, who realize the great economic loss due to present methods of holding men in enforced idleness, which impairs the strength of both mind and body, and which could otherwise be turned to good account by placing state prisoners at work in the rural districts.

The writer says: ‘‘Your article on ‘Farm Work for Prisoners’ interested me very much. While waiting for an electric train in Camden, a number of men came up the steps. All were dressed in army blue, and 1 asked an attendant at the station whether they were soldiers. He said they were prisoners on the way to Leesburg to work on farms and roads, and had come from the state prison at Trenton. We waved them a good-by; they all waved back and looked happy and contented. Whatever their crimes, the chance to work in the great outdoors will certainly help them to be better men and more able to support their families or themselves when they are released.’’
