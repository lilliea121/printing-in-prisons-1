THE CONSCIENCE

I sold my conscience to the world; 
The price I thought was good,
The conscience—’twas a useless thing; 
I needed clothes and food.
But when ’twas gone my joy went, too,
And peace had flown away,
The things the world gave in their place 
Were broken in a day.
And then the way grew steep and dark, 
My feet began to slide,
I did not know which way to go, 
For I had lost my guide.
I bought my conscience back again— 
My conscience worn and old!
The world demanded thrice the price 
Since I to him had sold.
Just all T had I paid for it, 
And took the poor thing back, 
And turned me to my empty home, 
Yet did not flee alack. 
It nestled in my heart, 
And held my life as true, 
And showed me right and wrong as clear 
As if it had been new. 
I have my conscience back again, 
The world may keep its gold, 
For peace and joy have flown back, too, 
And never shall be sold. — Unknown.
