THE UMPIRE

w

- OPPORTUNITY IN PRISON (?)

The question is asked by a writer in the
Saturday FEvening Post, if O. Henry would
“‘have found his vocation while in prison if,
instead of being given a comparatively light
occupation and humane treatment, he had
been subjected to the- brutal and crushing

~discipline many prisoners undergo? Would his
genius have flowered under such a regimen
as is described in that classic of prison fiction,

‘9009,” or in innumerable reports by trust-
worthy investigators? We think not.

“‘It is quite probable that Cervantes planned
and even wrote the first part of ‘Don Quixote’
while in prison. Mirabeau spent a very con-
siderable portion of his life in durance.
Dostoyevsky outlived ahorrible imprisonment
to produce some of the greatest novels ever
written. In other instances very superior
gifts have survived imprisonment. But very
superior gifts are exceptional.

“Why should not a prisonbe always a gate
of opportunity to all its itnmates? When civil-
azed society takes bodily possession of a man
—actually seizes his life and takes the direc-
tion of it wholly out of his hands, because he
has been directing it badly—why should it not
always systematically and intelligently try to
find outwhat heis really good for, and get him
at it?

" “‘Society can not be said to make such an
attempt. Mostly it subjects him to a rigidly
prescribed, uniform, repressive regimen that
is as far from discovering and encouraging
any budlet of talent—whether to write a book
or drive a dray—as a regimen well could
be.’’ .

CHOOSING UPWARD

It is pretty certain that ‘‘all the beauty and
wonder of life lies in the choice we make, and
the tragedy too,”” says a writer in Nautilus.

“Every moment of our lives some choice
confronts us, and we are called upon to use
our judgment, our experience, our faith, our
self-confidence, in making our decision.

“Going through life is like traveling down
a long corridor. which constantly presents
closed doors on either side—alternate doors
—one of which we must open and pass
through, irrevocably. We can not make use
of both doors, nor can we retrace our steps,
nor even reconsider our choice, once the
latch has been lifted. We must abide by our
decision. There are no exchanges. We must
do our considering before we choose, not
after. And the choice once made, whether
for good or ill, for better or worse, we must
pay the full price.

“This is well expressed by an old Persian
proverb: ‘Take what you will,” said the
gods to mortals, ‘but pay for it.” This world
is like a great balance-sheet, and the man
has not been born who has found a way to
tamper with the totals or to get around
God. Life holds us inexorably to our ac-
counting, and carries out the final reckoning
to the uttermost farthing.

OENT7Y
Only a little tiny spark,
Falling so softly down;
In one short hour a frightful glare
Shall rouse the sleeping town.

Only a little spiteful word,
A scarcely noted sneer,
Finding a sunny, joyous heart,

Leaving behind—a tear.

-Only a careless, mocking smile,
A fooljsh, ill-timed jest;

It quenched the dawning of a love,
Too weak to bear the test.

Only the shadow of a doubt,
The whisper of a friend,

It sent two lives to grieve apart,
Mistaken to the _ua.

Oniy a little broken toy,
Shabby and old and torn,

1t woke the memory of a loss
Too heavy to be borne.

Only the little daily wants
Left at the gate of prayer,
Taking instead the golden spoil,
Won from the Master there.

FROHMAN’S LITTLE SAFE

It is told of Charles Frohman that when he
was treasurer with Haverly’s Minstrels, he
conceived a novel scheme of arousing curi-
osity ‘‘in small towns. He bought asmall iron
safe, about three feet high, and on it had
painted in big letters, ‘Treasurer, Haverly's
Mastodon Minstrels.” Now actually there
was little need for this safe, but it was al-
ways carried on the first load of baggage
that went to a hotel. It would be placed in
a conspicuous place, and then Frohman, wait-
ing until the proper moment, would bustle
up to it with an air of great importance,
open it, put in two or three $100 bills, close
it, and go away. When the crowd had gone
he would slip back ana get the money out
again. It proved a good advertising stunt.’’

VIEWED FROM A CITY’S MOUNTAIN TOP

On gaining the top of one of New York’s
man-made mountains there is to be found the
same ‘‘peaceiul quiet ascn ary mountain
top. No sound from the street below comes up
this distance. Men on the sidewalks are in-
finitesimal dots, darting hither and yon.
Looking down upon them, one is inclined to
reflectiwhat puny beings humans are and from
this lofty point of view almost forgets his
sympathy for their personal interests. ; Then
comes the realization that this mountain was
built by these puny beings from materials
dug out of the earth in a crude s’?ate,
purified, shaped and fastened together in a
manner that will make it stand practically
for all time, and then a feeling of reverence
for the human brain—that God-given boon
which has made these things possible.”’

THE TOWER OF HERCULES

If you travel along the coast of the English
channel at Dover you may see the ‘‘ruins of
a Roman lighthouse that was built at the
time of the Roman conquest of Britain. An-
other ancient lighthouse, built less than a
century after the tower of Dover, is still
serving its original purpose. It was partly
rebuilt, and some alterations were made in
it, but in the main it is the same old structure
that guided the Roman galleys as they skirt-
ed the coast of the Bay of Biscey, making
their way to the Roman port of Brigantium.
This is the modern harbor of La Coruna, and
the lighthouse is the most ancient thing
about it. The Romans called it the tower of
Hercules, and the moderns have perpetuated
the name. The exact date of its erection is
not known, but inscriptions and other evi-
dence show that it was built in the time of
Trajan, between 98 and 117 A. D.”’

“THE STAR SPANGLED BANNER”

History tells us that ‘‘Francis Scott Key
wrote ‘The Star Spangled Banner’ on board
the British frigate Surprise during the bom-
bardment of Fort McHenry, Baltimore, by
the British in 1814. When the British at-
tacked the city, Key went on an errand, un-
der a flag of truce, to the British fleet, but
was detained while the bombardment took
place. He watched the progress of the fight
from the British ship during the night, and
in the morning, seeing the stars and stripes
still waving triumphantly, composed the fa-
mous song. It was at once printed and be-
came almost instantly popular.”

WONDERFUL HAND-WEAVING IN MEXICO

Those who have traveled through Mexico
tell of the wonderful hand-woven blankets
made by the Indian girls of Mexico, to whom
a dime a day is a good wage, although they
begin work at sunrise and labor until sunset.
They are the admiration and despair of all
who appreciate fine handiwork or value perfect
color combinations. A small blanket boughtin
Mexico City five years ago, although it has
been used as a wall tapestry ever since, seems
as brightin every one of itsrainbow colors as
on the day it was bought. The weaving is
so perfect that it has no right or wrong side.

JEWELS OF AN IDOL

The jewels of an Indian idol must be worth
stealing if many of those remarkably hideous
images possess such valuable head ornaments
as one made for the idol Parthasathy, in the
Triplicane temple in Madras. The ornament
is worth some 50,000 rupees and is made of
sovereign gold studded with diamonds, emer-
alds and rubies, the largest emerald being val-
ued at 1,000 rupees and the biggest ruby and
diamond at 300 rupees apiece.

«Philosophy is our highest conception of
life, its duties, and its destiny.”’
