A SONG OF TRUST

I can not always see the way that leads
To heights above;

I sometimes quite forget that He leads on
With hands of love;

But yet I know the path must lead me to
Immanuel’s land,

And when I reach life’s summit I shall know
And understand.

I can not always trace the onward course
My ship must take,

But, looking backward, I behold afar
Its shining wake

- [Nlumined with God’s light of love; and so

I onward go,

In perfect trust that He who holds the helm
The course must know.

I can not always see the plain on which
He builds my life;

For oft the sound of hammers, blow on blow,
The noise of strife,

.Confuse me till I quite forget He knows
And oversees,

And that in all details with His good plan
My life agrees.

I can not always know and understand
The Master’s rule;

I can not always do the tdSk He gives
In life’s hard school;

But I am learning, with His help, to solve
Them one by one,

And when I can not understand to say,
““Thy will be done.””’

NO ROYAL ROAD TO SUCCESS

“In climbing the ladder of success what
have you learned tnat you.could pass on as
aid to other struggling young men? Did you
conceive any shining goal and bend every-
thing to getting there?’’ was recently asked
the head of a large banking house.

‘“No,”” he replied emphatically. ‘“What-
ever job I had was to me -always the very
best job in the world, and I tried to fill it. I
made no elaborate plans for the future. If1I
had any system in my labor it was first to do
my own work; second, to teach the fellow
below me how to take my place; third, to
learn how to fill the position ahead of me.

¢Boys and young men should not imagine
that their work is so unimportant that no-
body takes note of how they do it. It does
not take long to find out whether a boy is on
his toes watching how he can best be of help

“in a situation or whether he merely sits down
 and waits to be told what to do. The simple
virtues of willingness, readiness, alertness

and courtesy will carry a boy farther than-

mere smartness.

‘“‘Perhaps it will not be out of place for me
to describe an incident which may carry a
lesson for the young men you are anxicus to
help. One day when I was teller a customer
offered me a very fine gold pen. I went right
into the office and asked if this man had any
loan from the bank. I explained that he had

asked me to accept the gift. The bank
promptly acted, and it was not long before
the fellow was in bankruptcy. The simple
course I took saved the bank a good deal of
money.’—Leslie’s

ELECTING A PRESIDENT

The power of Congress to deal with Elec-
toral College returns is answered by a writer
in the New York Tribune, who says:

““The electoral commission established the
precedent that Congress should not seek to
go behind certificates regularly submitted by
recognized state governments. That princi-
ple is aiso embodied in the Edmunds law of
1887, which defined and enlarged the power
of Congress to deal with Electoral College
returns.

“This Act directs that if any state shall
have provided by law before the selection of
electors for the final determination of con-
tests regarding their appointment, the state’s
decision shall be final unless the regularity
of the state’s action is questioned by both
houses of Congress.

“If two or more returns are received
these rules govern:

“First—If the state shall have determined
that the votes forwarded in one of the re-
turns were given regularly, those votes shall
be counted.

“Second—If two authorities, each claim-
ing regularity, shall both have determined
that the different sets of voters were regu-
larly cast, then Congress must decide which
set shall be accepted.

““Third—If the state shall have made no
determination, then Congress shall be free
to determine. But if the houses can not
agree, the votes of those electors whose ap-
pointment is certified by the governor shall
be counted.

““The general purport of the Act is to rec-
ognize the right of Congress to decide all
disputed questions in regard to the counting
of electoral votes which the state has not
decided or has decided irregularly.’’

TRY DEEP BREATHING

Deep breathing, sensible breathing, every-
day breathing—long life depends upon it,
good looks always. Yet nine-tenths of the
world’s creatures hate to breathe, and young
folks especially are asniggardly in the matter
of filling their lungs with clean, wholesome
air as if they thought they were dealing with
poison. Twenty long breaths night and
morning will quickly improve the looks of a
girl who has begun to go down with study
and carelessness, and surely there isno beau-
tifier cheaper than deep breathing.

Man is no better than a leaf driven by the
winds until he has conquered his lonely du-
ties. This makes a man—the habit of con-
fronting great things in solitude, and chiefly
the habit of conversing with God alone, and
of filling the soul with His strength.

PRAYER

Thy heart to my heart, great King of kings,
Throbbing its love and such glad things,
Thou thinking to me, God, as I fain would to
Thee,
Unfolding Thy purpose, Thy love, Thy great
plan,
Thy heritage sure for each child »f man;
Thy infinite patience with slowness and sin,
Thus proving Thy power all love to win;
Thou, taking my thoughts and transmuting
to gold
Their dross and their alloy, with pity untold;
Thou, blending Thy will with mine own
Freely proffered to Thee,
Thus possessed by Thyself, yetroyally free;—
This then is Prayer, God ¢f all souls,
Such communing with -Thee: therefore, O
Father,
Think Thou to me.-
~ —A. M. C. Dupree.

MEMORY OF MOTHER

Farewell, dear mother, sweet thy rest,
Weary with years and worn with pain,
Farewell till in some happy place
We shall behold thy face again.
We miss thy kind and willing hand,
Thy fond and earnest care,
Our home is dark without thee—
We miss thee everywhere.
Peaceful be thy silent slumber,
Peaceful in thy grave so low,
Thou no more will join our number,
Thou no more our sorrows know,
Yet again we hope to meet thee
When the day of life is fled,
And in Heaven with joy to greet thee
Where no farewell tears are shed.

— B 2750.

QUEENSLAND SAVAGES FADING AWAY

The aborigines of Queensland are fast fad-
ing away, and in view of the fact that this
race will be extinct an examination of their
social customs is interesting.

The death bone or bone apparatus, with its
supposed property of producing death, is one
of the most dreaded and universal supersti-
tions among the natives of the Queensland
interior. . The apparatus consists of a pointer
connected by a string with an elongated cylin-
drical receptacle. The pointer, three to tive
inches long, is made from a human forearm
bone, the string is made from human hair,
and the receptacle, which encloses the viec-
tim’s life-blood, is fashioned from a shinbone.
The ‘‘medicine man’’ of the tribe uses the
weapon by aiming the pointer at the perscn
selected for punishment.

One of the most curious of the aborlglnal
weapons is the ‘“‘whirler,”’ or ‘‘bull roarer.”’
It is made of a flattened piece of gidyea tim-
ber cut into spindle shape, into one extremity
of which a hole is drilled with a sharpened
emu bone. By means of the aperture this
whirler is attached to a piece of stick fixed
at the end of a small stick. Revolving
rapidly, the whirler gives out a roaring sound.
