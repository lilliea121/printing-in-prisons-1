Philadelphia, May 16, 1917

“‘For you, there is a reality, a fit place and
congenial duties.’”’

GET ACQUAINTED WITH YOURSELF

Some one has said that few men know
much concerning themselves and are rather
hazy at the fact of their very being, until
some one-comes along and gives them a jolt
which starts them to thinking that no one
thing on earth is so vital as to know of them-
selves.

Many men spend years in acquiring a knowl-
edge and development of the purely intel-
lectual side of life, but that knowledge can
not compare with the necessity of getting
thoroughly acquainted with yourself and find-
ing out what you are and where you expect
to ‘‘get off at.”’

You may be likened to a block of stone
that has been chiselled down to human size,
and, until some deep sorrow happens to cross
your path, the weaknesses of your character
are not revealed. It is then that you begin
to find yourself and to realize perhaps, that
there is more in life than in ‘‘drifting along
with the tide.”’

It is at this turn of affairs that you begin
to seek for something out of the ordinary
strife and whirl of life’s course, and to feel
the need of other and stronger influences
that appeal to your higher self.

This is the time to turn your thoughts to-
ward the splendors of Nature, and to men-
tally depict the beauties of the hills and val-
leys as finished by the Master Hand. It
needs no ritual, no doctrine, no elaboration
of any kind to show its perfection and ap-
pealing grandeur; the inspiring certainty of
it all is ample.

Any one who tries to write out the Golden
Rule, or disputes the intrinsic value of Divine
Mind as a positive need for guidance in our
daily lives, or who would attempt to reason
away what we know is right and true, is
headed for disaster.

These doubters seem to take delight in at-
tempting to make others unhappy with their
pessimistic ideas, to trample down and over-
turn whatever bears a hope for future de-
velopment or rehabitation. But if we will
but listen to the “‘still small voice within,’’

/

that ccnstantly tries to make itself heard,
there can be no question that we will come
into the full consciousness of a rugged belief of
a future that is worth the while.

It is when we become thoroughly convinced
of this fact that we begin to get acquainted
with ourselves and to understand that it re-
mains with us to make a finished fight to the
end that nothing can bar our progress to a
better relation with the world, if we will
only make up our mind to constantly adhere
to our convictions.

THE EXCESSIVE SENTENCE

Outside of being punitive the excessive sen-
tence is a mistake. If society wishes to pun-
ish, the excessive sentence could not be im-
proved upon, but if reformation is desired,
and that seems to be uppermost in most pris-
ons today, the exccssive sentence is a decid-
ed detriment. The one who has been unfor-
tunate enough to receive one of those long-
term sentences sees many enter and leave
prison for the same grade of offense that he
commatted. In mostinstances this leads to
embitterment, he feels and ‘thinks that he has
been discriminated against, that society has
shown noleniency to him, that society hasex-
acted its pound of flesh to the uttermost, and
that in return he owes nothing to society.

As long as the one with an excessive sen-
tence feels that he has had an injustice done
him any suggestion of reform will meet with
no response—he wlll be apathetic. Knowing
that it may be many years before the day of
his release comes, his interest in life lags—it
is only the strongest that can endure the strain
and still keep hope alive.

A uniform minimum sentence of one year
with the maximum as it is, would leave the
Board of Parole sufficient diseriminating pow-
ers, when in their opinion a man was ready
for it he could be granted a parole without vio-
lating any of the statutes. If within two or
three years a man has not learned the folly
of his ways the chances are that a longer
term would not remedy matters in the least.

When he has received some donsideration
from society—some leniency—he feels that he
owes something in return, that it is up to him
to show that it is appreciated, and in
most cases the one thus favored will make
good.

But he should have his chance without be-
ing made to wait too long for it, before long
years of waiting have taken energy. ambition
and hope away, before time has sapped
strength and vitality, before isolation from
the outside world has broken his spirit.
When society uses punitive rather than re-
formative methods it is easy to see that it
may be putting a stumbling block in the
way of the one it expects to make good.—
The Square Deal.

‘‘No man-can ever be happy when unfit for
simple and commonplace duty.’’

RELIGIOUS SERVICES

Catholic Mass is celebrated at the Prison
Chapel every Sunday at 7.30 o’clock, A. M.
Confession every Saturday morning.

General services are held on the various
Blocks at 9 o’clock every Sunday morning.

Episcopal services are held at the Chapel
on the third Thursday of every month.

Jewish services are held on Saturdays at
the band-room.

THE SPEED OF NO RETURN

The speed of no return is that speed which
one would have to send a body, a bullet for
instance, straight up in the air so that it
would never come back. The rate of this
speed is estimated to be about seven miles
a second. If a bullet could be given that
velocity away from the earth it would never
come back. The rate of this speed has been
estimated to be about seven miles a second. If
a bullet could be given that velority away
from the earth it would never fall back to our
planet, but would travel on into space in an
orbit of its own around the sun.

As to the possibilities of anything ever at-
taining this speed, no one can say. Scientists
say that all they know is that the friction of
the air would probably melt and then vapor-
ize the body before it succeeded in getting
through the earth’s ocean of air. The speed
of the modern army bullet is about one-
twelfth of the speed of no retnrn, being a °
little over half a mile a second.

Instances of the speed of no return are
seen when meteors fall into the atmosphere
of the earth. They very seldom reach the
earth’s surface, but are melted and vaporiz-
ed by the enormous amount of heat evolved
from friction with the air at such an enormous
ve locity.

EGGS STERILIZED BY GAS

A method of preserving eggs which is said
to keep them absolutely fresh for an indefi-
nite length of time is in use in France. New
laid eggs in tin cases holding 1,000 each are
placed in an autoclave, from which the air is
exhausted until all the gas within the shells
has been drawn out. Then carbonic acid gas
and nitrogen are introduced from tanks of
these gases in liquid form, and the tins con-
taining the eggs are sealed with solder. Any
germs of decay are killed by these gases, and
it is said that the flavor of the eggs is in no
way affected.

A sense of duty is natural to man and
there can be no true happiness without at-
tempting to fulfill it.
