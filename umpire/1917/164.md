The city of Roanoke is scarcely more than
twenty-five years old, but it has a popula-
tion of about 30,000, and it is sometimes
called the Chicago of Virginia. It was pro-
duced by the location of the Norfolk & West-
ern shops. Men who were failures else-
where have made their fortunes in Roanoke,

THE UMPIRE
HONOR CLUB NOTES

The First Section passed a very agreeable
afternoon on Saturday last. With weather
conditions at their best, which could best be
described as bracing; with free sunshine,
free air, free musie, and that not of the
canned variety which nightly distracts the
air; free baseball, which should have been
of the canned variety, and free speech. A
ladies’ sewing circle, a Cooper Union mass
meeting and the Tower of Babel combined
would have nothing on the yard on a Satur-
day afternoon. Had a ‘‘Hot-dog man’’ or
two been present it would have been an ab-
solutely ‘‘Perfect Day.”’

Conditions were just right for marching
and there were but few stragglers. ““Twice
around’’ was the order of the day, and with
banners waving proudly in the sun, “‘Pete’’
stepping high, ‘‘Nick,’”” the so-soon-to-be-
deported, wearing the smile that won’t come
off —mot even had Old Dutch Cleanser been
used; the band, with the Professor all smiles,
doing it’s ‘‘durndest’’— we hope the censor
passes this—;the bugle corps waking the
echoes—they would have wakened Rip Van
Winkle had they been in the vicinity during
that gentleman’s celebrated sleep, although
when we come to think it over, we’re not so
sure of that, as there are some Rip Van
Winkles in here who have been asleep for
more than twenty years, and it hasn’t wa-
kened them. Well, it was some ‘‘Peerade.’’

The 1st Block surpassed their former fine
record as marchers. They kept almost per-
fect alignment and step, and really looked
fine. Give Pershing a few regiments like
that and the flag would be in Berlin within
a month. We will gladly head a fund to
send the 1st Block and the bugle corps ““Over
There,’” and we feel sure they’d bring back
the “‘bacon.’”” If they didn’t they’d bring
back nearly everything else that was un-
attached.

We would like to call the attention of the
‘“‘bleacherites’” to the fact that there are
several American flags in the parade, and
that it is an accepted custom for an Amer-
ican to rise to his feet and remove his hat or
cap when the flag goes by; but judging from
the actions of the spectators along the line
of march on Saturday there are mighty few
Americans—and men—among them, for 90
per cent. of them sat quite still, and we’re
not sure but some of them actuslly held
their caps on.. At a time when men are
fighting and dying for that flag, we might
at least give it the tribute of an outward re-
spect. Any man who won’t do so, deserves
everything he’s getting, except the pot-pie.

The music of the afternoon was of that
high order of excellence which Prof. Wie-
gandt and his men so consistently furnish.
The Warden, with a party of Army officers,
stood by while the band rendered a patriotic
selection, and the visitors heartily applauded
its really fine performance. Mr. Kraupa

_«——M
e T — e e

and Hon. Jimmy Mulligan were present dur-
ing the afternoon and met a hearty welcome,
B 8524, “D.C.”” you all know him, was the
pianist of the afternoon, and though not quite
a Paderewski, tickled that old piano’s ribs
till she fairly chortled with glee. The Black-
bird Quartette were individualy and collect-
ively melodious. B 8354 sang ‘‘Same Old
Girl”’ but neglected to mention name, B 8390
sang ‘‘Make Hay While the Sun Shines in
Virginia’’ and evidently wished he was back
there doing it; and his audience agreed with
him. =B 7553 sang ‘‘All the World Will be
Jealous of Me,’” which we think a mistake.
B 7935 sang ‘‘Night-Time in Dixie Land’’ in
a suspiciously realistic manner, while the
combined Quartette sang ‘Rocked in the
Cradle of the Deep’’ so realistically as to
make a number of their hearers sea-sick.

We find it hard to say anything about the
base-ball games of the afternoon. It would be
invidious to draw comparisons, so we’ll just
say they were all bad and only accident pre-
vented the scores from being equally large.
The 1st Block tied the Dodgers; who could’nt
dodge. The 8th Block Bums certainly lived
up to their names in their contest with the
9th Block Stars, who amassed 14—counte’m,
fourteen—runs from them. We think it
more charitable, and in better taste, to draw
a veil over the whole matter, and leave the
actors therein to their memories.

Next Saturday, Oct. 6, the Second Section
comes forth as follows 4B, 5B, 4G, 7B, 7G, 3B. -
