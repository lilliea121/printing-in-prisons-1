Philadelphia, July 11, 1917

‘It 18 best to follow even the -shadow of the
best than to remain content with the worst.”’

IT IS BETTER TO FORGIVE

It has been said that all of us have our
share of shortcomings, that each one has his
or her peculiar failings; and it is true. Yet
how hard we can be in criticising the weak-
nesses of others! One might opine from the
severe manner in which we seem inclined to
judge others that we are nearly perfect our-
selves. Some are so bitter in condemning
others that no one would imagine that we
had faults of our own to be overlooked, or
sins to be forgiven. :

The moat in our neighbor’s eye looks so
large that one is apt to forget all about the
beam in their own. It is so easy to judge.
Criticism comes all too easily to our lips; the
soft words of leniency and forgiveness come
all too seldom. By the latter only may we
hope to uplift and beautify the character;
while the former is sure to warp and sour it.
Eventually those who are inclined to severe
criticisms find they are unable to judge im-
partially, because they constantly seek for
flaws.

““There’s so much that’s good in the worst
of us, and so much that’s bad in the best of
us,’’ that we are unfit to judge others. No
one has the right to cast thefirst stone these
days, as stoning has passed out of date as a
punishment for sinners. But the modern
Pharisee has adopted harsh words to knock
his nzighbors, with little regard of truth or
justifiable excuse for his course. The ten-
dency of the day seems to be one of criticism,
and but few have the bigness of heart and
broadness of mind to forgive a transgression,
whether pardon is sought or not. The little
seeming slights of our friends are allowed to
rankle in our minds until they grow from
mole hills to mountains. Leniency in pass-
ing opinion about others should be a trait
cultivated by every one.

We should all endeavor to have the for-
bearance necessary to overlook the little.of-
fenses of our neighbors and friends. It may
seem a difficult undertaking, but how are we
to expect forgiveness if we do not extend. it

to others? Did not the Master say we must
forgive one another?

Frequently you may hear men say, ‘I’ll
never forgive so-and-so for what they did to
me.’’ That is a hateful spirit to hold in the
mind, and it is sure to bring its own punish-
ment to the one who nourishes it. Why
should we act-as judges of others? Even
though the offense be grievous, is it not bet-
ter to lighten the heart and relieve the mind
by forgiveness? Surely!—for we never know
when we may have occasion to seek pardon
ourselves.

INDOLENCE

Indolence is the sleep of the mind. What
is often called indolence is, in fact, the un-
conscious consciousness of incapacity.

What men want is not talent: it is purpose;
in other words, not the power to achieve, but
the will to labor.

The darkest hour in the history of any
young man is when he sits down to study
how to get money without honestly earning
it. <

Laziness grows on people; it begins in cob-
webs, and ends in iron chains.—The more
one has to do the more he is able to accom-
plish. 4

Indolence is the dry rot of even a good
mind and a good character; the practical use-
lessness of both. It is the waste of what
might be a happy and useful life.

So long as he must fight his way, the man
of genius pushes forwaid, conquering and to
conquer. But how often is he at last over-
come by a Capua! Ease and fame bring
sloth and slumber.

Of all our faults, that which we most read-
ily admit isindolence. — We persuade ourselves
that 1t cherishes all the peaceful virtues, and
that without destroying the others it merely
suspends their functions.

I look upon indolence as a sort of suicide;
for the man is effectually destroyed, though
the appetite of the brute may survive.

THE WILD PIGEON

That the wild pigeon, once so common in
the United States, has become extinct is one
of the strangest mysteries in American nat-
ural history. It is a puzzle which has baffled
scientists and which probably never will be
solved. Half a century ago wild pigeons were
abundant in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana,
Kentucky and all the states of the Middle
West. In their migrations they traveled in
flocks numbering ters of thousands, and it
sometimes took a gingle flock the better part
of an hour to pass a given point. Vast num-
bers of the pigeons were killed every year by
gunners, but many investigators hold that
the complete disappearance of the species
must have been due in part at least to other
causes. No other bird was ever so numerous

in this country as the pigeon.

RELIGIOUS SERVICES

Catholic Mass is celebrated at the Prison
Chapel every Sunday at 7.30 o’clock, A. M.
Confession every Saturday morning. ]

General services are held on the various
Blocks at 9 o’clock every Sunday morning.

Episcopal services are held at the Chapel
on the third Thursday of every month.

Jewish services are held on Saturdays at
the band-room.

THE TREMBLING ASPEN

It is easy to distinguish this tree from its
neighbors in the woods. It is also easy to
find it. Watch a myriad of shiny green and
yellow leaves trembling and shaking like a
man with the ague. There may not be
a breath of wind stirring; at least none that
you can notice, says a writer in Nature.
Leaves on other trees are as still and motion-
less as though they were dead. Yet this tree
is all a-flutter from base to top. It is the
aspen; also called quaking asp. You’ll want
to know why it is seldom ever still. Break
off a branch and examine the leaves. You’ll
find that the stems are flat and the flat sur-
face joins the blade of the leaf at right an-
gles. Thus there are four flat surfaces to
catch the slightest breeze, and the éspen
tree is continually trembling. The aspen is
a slender tree and grows from forty to
eighty feet high. Its bark is rough and dark
at the base of the trunk. The upper part
of the tree is a pale greenish brown, or
nearly white. The poplar tree belongs to the
same family, but the leaves of the poplar
have round stems. In May the seeds of the
aspen ripen. They are oblong and covered
with long white hairs. The wind picks them
up like little balloons and scatters them
broadcast.

NEW YORK’S GREAT SUBWAYS

More than 2000 trains start each day from
the terminals of New York’s subway sys-
tems. They are run on schedules as careful-
ly prepared and as closely timed as those of
a trunk line railroad.

Between 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 persons
ride each day on the subway. This is more
than twice the number carried daily by all
the trains on the entire Pennsylvania rail-
road system. ,

Nearly two-thirds of the New York users
of the subway are carried during the morn-
ing and evening rush hours.

““I don’t expect to fence in many acres of
this beautiful old world,”” says a Georgia
philsopher, ‘‘but what little ground I gain I
hope to make as beautiful as old Adam’s
possessions were before he ran away with the
idea that what he didn’t know about the ap-
ple business wasn’t worth knowing.’’
