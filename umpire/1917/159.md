twentieth century aerial combats extends even
to the vehicles used. What is a flying ma-
chine but the ancient war chariot soaring on
wings? In many an encounter two-man ma-
chines still battle for supremacy—one man
an observer, the other a pilot. The observer
is the fighting hero of old, wielding a machine
gun instead of a sword; the pilot his faith-
ful charioteer.

Carry the analogy still further and consider
how much is at stake when battleplane meets
battleplane. The fate of an ancient army
depended on a prince in his war chariot; the
fate of an army corps now hangs on the in-
~ formation gleaned by a victorious flyer.

OUR MOST BEAUTIFUL ELK

A naturalist of national repute claims that
the stately elk is the most beautiful of our
remaining wild animals. Known to the In-
dians by the name of wapiti, it would seem
most fitting if this typical American animal
should become known by that name. The
wapiti is the largest of the red deer family
and closely resembles his smaller brother,
the European stag. The wapiti is not prop-
erly an elk, as the European elk is more
closely allied to the American moose.

This majestic animal is now to be found
mainly in the states of Montana, Idaho and
Wyoming, though about 4,000 head are
thought to remain in Colorado, and consider-
able numbers are scattered through western
Canada. The Campfire Club of America and
other organizations and individuals are work-
ing for its preservation. The favorite home
of the elk is the Yellowstone National Park,
where he has no rifle to fear and where cou-
gars, coyotes and timber wolves are kept
under control. In the park and its vicinity
are probably 50,000 head, distributed in two
main herds.

It is said that during the summer season
the elk live high up in the mountains, gener-
ally at an elevation of 8,000 to 11,000 feet.
The grassy plateaus offer an ideal summer
range. Even on the woodedsides of the
highest ravines there are parklike glades
where the elk late in the afternoons come out
to feed. Itis difficult to imagine a more
beautiful sight than is then afforded by these
_stately and graceful animals. . Although
their number in the park may sometimes
reach as high as 60,000 head, it is rare for
visitors to see a single specimen. Visitors
are taken in stages around a regular route
arranged for viewing the natural phenomena
of that great outdecor museum.

Old hunters assert that the elk dislike to
be pursued by campers with cameras, and
keep away from the stage routes. If visitors
would leave the highways of the park and
seek out its byways, either on foot or by
pack and saddle trips, they would have a
marvelous opportunity to study the greatest
exhibit which survives of our mountain wild
life—not only the elk, but mountain sheep,
deer, beaver and many other animals.

THE UMPIRE

A PATH OF GOLD

A path of gold—oh, build it quick and straight

For mercy’s feet to tread!

There is no time to wait—

Each minute pulses red

From Freedom’s wounded heart.

Make haste to do your part!

Swift as they are, your gifts will be too late

To help the dead.

But there are those who live, whom you can
spare

A little of the agony they bear

For you—that’s true; have you not thought
how true?

For you,

These, who have learned how much body and
soul endure,

Their church bells were as sweet as ours,

Their gardens were as glad as flowers,

Their women were as pure,

Their children sang and laughed and played

As merry and as unafraid—

O little heads bowed on the desks as though

The lesson being hard, you fell asleep!

We shudder and we weep—but tears are

cheap.

More, more than tears must pay the debt we
owe

To those whose bleeding breasts have been
our shield,

A wall that will not yield.
God knows this moment is too deep for hate.
The hour is great, it calls us to be great.
Our hand shall comfort him whom it must
strike—
For wounded friend and wounded foe alike
A path of gold! Oh, build it quick and
straight!
—Amelia Josephine Burr.

KEEP CLIMBING

Although your chance in life seems small,
Rough the path and dark,

Don’t worry that you’re going to fall,
But get a firmer start.

Slowly trudge on toward the goal,
Keep headed the right way,

Remember you can never win
Life’s battle in a day.

Like climbing up the ladder,
Ascending step by step,

Keep your aim the highest
Lest your mission you forget.

When at last the top is gained,
Thank God the task is done; -
Look back upon the steps you’ve climbed.
The battle nobly won.
— Milwawkee Sentinel.

BEGINé NEW CAREER AT SIXTY

A prominent wri ter declares that it is
rather an unusual event for a man to begin a
new career after reachingsixty years of age
and win fame. William de Morgan,however,
suprised the world with a novel of such scope
and distinction that it recalled the masters of

- nights.

Victorian fiction, and outdid the classic ex-
ample of Cato learning Greek at eighty.

Yet the miracle is not incapable of explena-
tion. He hadlived for years in an atmosphere
of art and literature as- a member of the
Chelsea group in which Rossetti and Burne-
Jones were distinguished figures, and the fact
that he devoted himself so long toillustration
work in stained glass and pottery didnotpre-
clude the existence of creative instinct of an-
other kind. It was characteristic of that
circle, indeed, to find more than one vehicle
of expression. De Morgan was slower than
some of the others to turn to the pen—a be-
lated William Morris. It would be idle to
deplore circumstances. The finished work of
‘‘Joseph Vance’’ must have been in one way
or another the result of years of silent ap-
prenticeship. : ;

FOOD CONSERVATION IN 1777

An interesting historical fact, brought to
public attention by Senator Henry L. Myers,
of Montana, is that the Congress of 1777 en-
gaged in grain preservation just as the Con-
gress of today.is doing, and on February 27

" of that year adopted a resolution reading:

“Resolved, That it be recommended to the
several Legislatures of the United States,
immediately to pass laws the most effectual
for putting an immediate stop to the perni-
cious practise of distilling grajn, by which
the most extensive evils are likely to be de-
rived, if not quickly prevented.’’

Senator Myers, after dwelling upon the
wisdom and patriotism of the Continental
legislators, appealed to the Senators to catch
up with their ancestors.

THOROUGHNESS

“T would not be one of those who would
foolishly drive a nail into mere lath and plas-
tering; such a deed would keep me awake
Give me a hammer and let me feel
for the furring. Drive a nail home and clinch
it so faithfully that you can wake up in the
nightand think of it with satisfaction, a work
at which you would not be ashamed to invoke
the Muse. So will help you God, and so only.
Every nail driven should be as another rivet
in the machine of the universe, you carrying

on the work.”’
— Thoreau.

THE EMBLEM OF CHRISTIANITY

The emblem of practical Christianity is the
Samaritan stooping over the wounded Jew.
No fastidious hand can lift from the dust fall-
en humanity and bind up its unsightly gashes.
Sentimental lamentation over evil and suf-
fering may be indulged in until it becomes a
sort of melancholy luxury, like the weeping
for Thammuz by the apostate daughters of
Jerusalem. — Whattier.

Before the war tourists spent about $100, -
000,000 in Itlay.
