THE UMPIRE

HONOR CLUB NOTES.

BUSINESS

Club business during the week was at an
unusually low ebb. At the Board of Govern-
ors meeting on October 29, the only business

“was tbe application of an ex-member for
re-instatement, which was granted, with
a ¢ Watch your Step’’ warning. The
Board of Delegates met on October 30,
and passed favorably upon thirteen appli-
cations for membership; two of the new
members donating a total of $1.10 to the Club
Treasury. They may prove to be the long
looked for Philanthropists.
A 8432, introduced B 6465 as the new Del-
egate for the 3rd Bleck, and he was ap-
propiately welcomed by the Board. He re-
sponded with a neat and telling speech of
thanks, which completely qualifies him for a
job with the ‘‘Four-Minute Men’’ upon his
release. Though we fear he gave his politics
away by his remarks about the ‘‘Square
Deal.”

‘ ENTERTAINMENT

The Second Section had every reason to be
pleased with the entertainment provided for
it on last Saturday afternoon. Miss Russell
had an array of artists present who in num-
bers, and talents, any theatre in the city
would have been proud to sponsor, and Mr.
Kraupa, not be outdone, provided a couple of

- his best pictures, though we regret to state,
that by reason of one of the machine operators
having a ‘‘brain storm,’’ and playing both
ends against the . middle, the effect of the
first picture, ‘‘Stepping Stones,’’ was some-
what spoiled. We suppress the culprit’s iden-
tity in the interest of peace in the family.
His past record has been so uniformly good
that we can afford to overlook this little in-
discretion.

During the presentation of the picture,
Miss Angellotti, our volunteer pianist, enter-
ed, and was given the heartiest of welcomes.
She was recognized, even in the darkness
and her progress to the front was to the ac-
companiment of a running fire of applause.
There can be no doubt of our appreciation of
her kindness in sacrificing so large a portion
of her time to us.

After the disappointing ending of the pie-
ture, the Professor, and his versatile band
soothed our shat*tered nerves with musie, and
then Miss Russell introduced to us Mr. Billy
Griffis, proprietor of the Vaudeville Times,
who was heartily welcomed. The first act
on the program was Lewis & Carlin, announced
as ‘‘Musicians,’”” though we are sure that
the younger Strauss in his wildest moments
never imagined such ‘‘stunts’’ as theirs. They
were very much to the audience’s liking, and
deserved the hearty applause given them.
Miss Russel, overcoming every handicap of
lack of ‘‘props,’’ and rehearsal, then staged
a most creditable Minstrel act which carried
off the honors of the day. Mr. George Car-
lin acted as Interlocutor, and made a very

The Chairman,’

happy foil for the jokes of ‘‘Sambo’’ and
‘“‘Bones’’ the end-men, who appeared in black-
face. Mr. Brown’s singing, and a Quartette
number which won an instant encore, by the
Comedy Four, were the outstanding features
of the act.© Wehope it will berepeatedin the
near future. - Alittlelady then gave an exhibi-
tion of character singing and dancing which
caused every one present to forget her age,
and size, and hail her as the lady of their
choice. The only living rival of the Great
Hermann—he’s dead—then captured our at-
tention with some extremely mystifying card
‘tricks. We imagine ““D.C.’” is still trying
to puzzle out how those cards got away from
him. Theremainingacts were as on the pre-
vious Saturday; Cleveland & Dillon, Juveniles,
who have the aptitude, and sang-froid of old
hands at the game; Mr. Thompson, a juggler
of renown, whom we would like to have handle
our accounts for a season; and last, but not
least, the gentleman of the mobile count-
enance, and the well trained banjo, whom the
colured portion of the audience found so
attractive. It was a long and delightfully
varied program, and excellent in every part.

As a grand finale to an afternoon of fun,
Mr. Kraupa presented a very funny two-reel
farce, ‘‘Bucking Society’’ with the inimita-
nable Ches Conklin playing the stellar role.

It was a ‘‘wild’’ West scene, and practical-
y everything on the cards happened to Ches,
from riding a bucking steer, tobeing ‘‘collect-
ed’”’ in company with a mail-bag by the Fast
Mail. Those of our number who have been
‘‘crooked’’ for sheer love of the risk, and the
xcitement of such a life, should turn to the
““movies’’ when released, it’s a risky enough
life to satisfy the most exacting, while as
for excitement it’s chases have the real man-
hunt beaten, and there’s no Judge to spoil
the ending. Better think it over, boys.

Tne Second Section found it a most satis-
fying afternoon, and tender their sincerest
thanks to Miss Russell, to Mr. Kraupa, and
to the artists who gave so generously of
their time, and talent, without hope or ex-
pectation of material reward.

There consciousness of a good deed well
done is their best reward, transcending our
poor thanks.

In the beginning of the show the President
mounted the rostrum and prescnted to the
appreciative view of the audience a beauti-
ful silver cup, with the announcement that
it was the gift of a member of the Board of
Governors of the Club, B 8361 to be exact,
better known locally as ‘‘Curly,’’ and was to
become the property of the Block or Gallery
whose record for good behavior at the enter-
tainments, marching, ete., stood highest
during the year; the number of such Block
or Gallery would be engraved upon it; a fit-
ting case would be provided, and it would
stand at the head of said Block or Gallery
during the succeeding year, to be retained
by it if possible. The Inspectors on their
rounds would give it the double-O, and prob-
