Philadelphia, May 23, 1917

“We must find our duties in what comes to
us, not in what might have been.’’

EMPLOYMENT OF PRISONERS

Commenting on the good work of Chaplain
A. J. Soldan in his employment bureau at
the United States penitentiary, LLeavenworth,
Kan., the Public Ledger says that it has its
parallel in the efforts made by humane pris-
on officials ‘‘elsewhere in West and East, to
enable a man to leave a prison, as it were,
upon his feet and with his head up, instead
of crippled to helplessness by his record. A
prison door nowadays ought to shut a man in
upon an educational opportunity instead of a
black vacuum that fills with maddening de-
spair. Many manufacturers whose letters
Chaplain Soldan quotes express their willing-
ness to supply a second chance to the man
who went wrong. The time is coming when
a jail sentence will be the equivalent of a
liberal education to many a man who was
first steered into wrong courses by an evil
coalition of idleness and ignorance. - The
modern prison intends to redeem, and the
penal system has failed of its purpose if it
goes no further than to condemn. A man
made over is a man ‘‘for a’ that’’—and per-
haps a better man than one who needed no
reforming. 3

HOLLOW PATRIOTS

If a man goes up and down declaring that
he is honest we instinctively look to our goods
and chattels. Yet we are expected to take
to our arms every man who bellows about
his love of country, says the New York Even-
ing Post. There is a moral in the remark
which sensible Americans should keep in
mind just now. If the United States sends
an army to Europe its rank ana file will not
be composed of the men who now stand
about in public places pointing to themselves
as patriotic superiors. Our first, our second
and our last line of defense will be made up
of modest, tolerant men who never raise
their voices to advocate war, who hoped unto
the final hour that the President and Con-
gress would find honovable means of avoiding
war. The loud-mouths will always be found
in the rear, feeding the fires of hate, far
from the scene of peril.

ELIMINATING THE LOAFERS

Cleveland has eliminated the corner loung-
er by placing under arrest all persons found
hanging around public buildings and street
corners, who are unable to give a satisfac-
tory account of themselves. It would seem
that other cities could follow this precedent
with advantage. The Plain Dealer pressed
this matter until decisive action resulted, and
in a recent article declared that the street
loafer needed drastic treatment.

“He is a simpler problem than many of the
municipal worriments. He will not, however,
succumb to mere moral suasion. A sojourn
in confinement is more effective than a slap
on the wrist. Suppression of the street idlers
is no easy task, but no community can afford
to neglect it. - The law-abiding public, as
well as the police and the courts, have a duty
in this direction. The menace of street loaf-
ing can be removed if a community sets its
hand to the task. The only men unable to secure
emyloyment in these days are the unemploy-
able.”’

A SENSIBLE MOVE

No thoughtful person will question that
Governor Whitman, of New York, has taken
a step in the right direction, which is both
humane and sensible, in arranging for an ex-
pert test of the mental state of condemned
homicides. As provided, this test is to be
made shortly after conviction, and it should
avoid such last-hour appeals-‘as that made to
the Governor recently, on the ground that a
man about to be executed was believed to be
insane. The procedure in many states re-
specting capital crimes is such a glaring ex-
hibition of how not to do it that almost any
reform in that direction is to be welcomed.

By his action the Governor has secured for
himself, and probably for his successors, re-
lief from the harrowing duty of having to
interfere, or to refuse to interfere, with the
carrying out of the death penalty in the case
of a man who may not have been legally re-
sponsible for his crime. ‘

ORPHEUS IN THE E. S. P.

‘‘Music hath charms’’ the Poet wrote,
And phrased it excellently well,
Ulysses feared the Siren’s note,
And by it Orpheus won through Hell,
Yet left Furydice behind
As you leave us, but never mind,
You sang, and we’re the more resigned.

‘‘Mandalay’’

You who have followed the world around,
What were you thinking then?

Did you hear the drums of the desert sound
Calling you back again

To the'blazing reach of a tropic beach,
Or the gloom of a jungle way?

‘Did the old love wake, and yearn to take
The road to Mandalay?

““Rolling Down to Rio’’

You who have followed the sea in s‘hips,
What did it mean to you?

Did you taste the saltsea spray on your lips
As youfollowed the chanty through?
You who have seen the long seas lift,
The pale stars peer through the scudding
drift, .
What were the dreams you knew?
‘““Briar Rose’’

It bloomed for you in a country lane
For you in a cxty street,
But will the Rose e’er bloom again,
You trod beneath your feet?
The one Rose, the White Rose, you plucked
and tosst away,
Oh! what wouldn’t you give if you could
“but live,
Over that bygone day!

“Le Jeal’s Credo’’—(Sung by E. S. P. Choir. )

And you, the whole of you broken men,
What were your thoughts as you raised
the hymn,
Your soul’s belief thus voicing?
Were your thoughts of the Past and its
sore defeats,
Were the lusts and the wines,
broken meats,
The cause of your thus rejoicing?
Was it not that you thought of the day to
come, :
When you’ve paid in full for the deed
you’ve done,
And the cloud has passed from o’er you‘?
When the gates unbar and you’re ‘free
again,
"And better, and braver, and wiser men
With newer life before you.

““The Star Spangled Banner’’

and the

You that have worn the old uniform,
What were you thinking of?
If you had your will, would you follow it still,
The old Fiag that we love?
Were you given the chance, would you ‘list
for France,
And go marching away to the war,
To die like a man, in the battle van,
With the old Flag floating o’er?

The days that are so long and drear, -
You’ve brightened with a thread of gold;
We have one hour the less to fear
_Of all the tale that’sleft untold,
And we’re all of us sorry, and all of us glad;
.Glad of the glorious hour we had,
Sorry that ever we’d been so bad.
- —R. E. A.
