prideful column, with the Warden as Grand
Marshal, and the Band blaring it’s loudest,
wound twice about the Institution, and then
on returning to the home grounds, at the
Warden’s suggestien sang The Star Spangled
Banner as a fitting conclusion to a ‘‘Perfect
Day.”’

broke up from shell-fire and traffic. But out
side of a few broken springs we came out
0. K. We were for a time in a village that
was practically leveled by shell fire. But we
managed to find a couple of rooms with a
portion of the second story fioor over them
and made our quarters there. Now that our
division has been relieved and we are back in
in reserve for a week or two we can write
more frequently. This town we are in has a
few civilians but the majority of the inhabit-
ants have gone away on account of the
Germans being so close at one time. But not
now. The people have left quite a few
furnishings and if we want a table or chair
we just go from house to house and get one,
This town has not been damaged so far. We
have quite a number of Boche helmets, over-
coats, bayonets, machine-guns, rifles, and
numerous other things but too large to send.
I am on kitchen duty now. Tell the boss
and the family I asked for them, also give
Elsie one of the buttous I sent for being so
faithful and for selling so many Liberty
Loan Bonds. I think she deserves it,
Thanks for the UMPIRES and tell all the men
