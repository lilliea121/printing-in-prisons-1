THE UMPIRE

(Continued from page 1)

last Saturday was an ideal day, and every-
body but the sick was out to enjoy it. But
two of the higher officers of the H. F. C.
were onhand to chaperone the boys, being the
venerable Chairman of the Board of Govern-
ors who practically had risen from a sick-
bed to perform that pleasing duty, and the
Treasurer, who seems immune to all earthly
ills; the rest were interned by reason of var-
ious ailments. But Col. Jake inall the glory
of a new uniform (?), andlacking only a sword
to be a facsmile of Napoleon, amply made
up their absence, and led his veterans in a
charge around the Institution in such wise
as to winthe encomiums of the Comander-in-
Chief, and Reviewing Officers.

Following the parade’s disbandment, a
Minstrel performance was staged by the
Entertainment Committee—Count, Jerry,
and George— which proved to be the best
which has yet graced the locel season. The
singing was good, the jokes were reasonably
new, and sparkled very effectively in the
outer air’ and the audience, in no very criti-
cal mood, gave generous appreciation to their

efforts.
Leading off with a medley of popular—and

patriotic—songs by the entire Company, the
leader Van, next announced an Overture by
the Volunteer Orchestra, who acquitted them-
selves very well, indeed. this followed by a
- rapid interchange of persiflage between the
interlocutor, and the End Men, who were D.
C. as bones, Herb, featured as String-bean
and resembling one in everything but plum-
age; Brooks, and Ducky, completed this in-
teresting quartette of fun-makers,iwho were
just as funny as they lookt; D. C’ s Big Ben
waist-watch making quite a hit with his dis-
eriminating audience but we’re afraidthenew

fashion wont take.
Van opened the ball by singing the inter-

esting ballad ‘““When 1 Fight My Way Back
To Carolina’’, and did nobly, then followed
some fun with the end-men, and Frenchy,
B 8963, entertained us with a spirited version
of ‘‘Paul Revere,’’ then Brooks, B 7935,
attired in the nearest approach to a Palm
Beach suit we’ve seen in two years, sang,
‘““‘After you’'re gone’’ but without pointing
out anyone in particular; and Harris obliged
with ‘‘That Boy of Mine,’’ then the versatile
“‘String-bean’’ showed himself a master of
magic by transferring an article from one
receptacle toc another and back again by the
mere power of words, and all in full view of
hisaudience whose mystification was complete.

Van, B 9084, obliged once more with that
touching little ballad, ‘‘Good-bye, Mother
Machree,’’ and then came a spirited conver-
sazione between D. C. and the excellent
‘‘String-bean’’ which was quite the hit of
the afternoon, and demanded an encore.
Frenchy then sang a tender little ditty which
bore his ‘‘moniker,’’ and Joe, B 8886 render.
ed ‘“‘Turn Back the Universe’’ in the most
approved manner, but without any signs of

having his wish granted. Then the Colonel
mounted the stage and summoned ‘‘Dude’’
for a farewell appearance, he being sched-
uled to leave on the morrow. Jake spoke
of his ability as an entertainer, and asked
him to give the audience a last song, and in
response he sang the ‘‘Jazz Band’’ song to
the very great pleasure of his hearers. D.
C. followed with ‘‘Daddy Mine,’”’ and then
came a dancing contest between Chatham,
B 8915, and D. C. in which more steps were
exhibited than there are in the Washington
Monument. Then came a duet in whlich
‘“‘Dude’’ re-appeared with D. C. and the
twain sang ‘‘Homeward Bound.’’ very appro-
priate, in view of the circumstances of the
one. The show closed with a grand Chorus
by the entire company, but the audience had
fled before the anticipated collection could
be taken up.

today authorized placing war contracts with
the heads of prisons and reformatories at
prevailing prices, and directs that prisoners
engaged on such contracts shall receive
wages corresponding to those paid for simi-
lar work in the vicinity. .

Extensive plans are being worked out for
makihg use of the man-power of Federal
penitentiaries and other penal instituticns
during the war. Congress already has pro
vided for industrial plents at some of th
prisons. Let us pray.
