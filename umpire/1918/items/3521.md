THE LARGE SNAKES OF BRAZIL

The largest snakes known are found in Brazil, and one would have to go far into the interior to find them. They are found in the immense valley of the Amazon river and its tributaries, observes a naturalist. This extensive basin, being low ground consists partly of swamps and forest Jungle into which white men seldom penetrate The forest and vegetation are so dense that the sun cannot get through to the ground, and being right under the equater, the continual, oppressive, moist heat makes this jungle and swamps the ideal breeding place for the big snakes and other reptiles.

However, of the 180 varieties of snakes known in Brazil, not 10 per cent are venomous, and of these very few of the big ones. Of the non-venomous ones the largest and the best known is the boa constrictor.
