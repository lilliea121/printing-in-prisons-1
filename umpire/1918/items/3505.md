PAROLED MAN'S RANK SAVED BY GOVERNOR

A late news report from New York, announces that Governor Whitman was confronted with an unusual situation when he suddenly found himself in the executive chamber face to face with a man in an army officer’s uniform. The man told the Governor that although he was a captain in the army and he had been recommended for promotion to major and expected to go to France next week he was in great distress.

“I am well beyond the draftage,’’ he said, “but when this country entered the war I went to a training camp and have been steadily advanced since.

“All my life I have tried to be on the square, but I fell several years ago. I was sentenced to State’s prison and three years ago you paroled me. I thought your act had restored me to citizenship, but I learned it did not.

“Several weeks ago men of my home town, Brooklyn, threatened to reveal to the army authorities I am an ex-convict and considered a felon. I couldn’t afford to fight them, and knowing you would give me a square deal, I came here.

“You want to be restored to citizenship and you shall be,’’ said the Governor.

A few minutes later the captain walked out of the executive chamber armed with a Governor's pardon restoring him to citizenship.
