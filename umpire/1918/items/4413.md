HEALTH AND HOW TO GET IT THROUGH EXERCISE

Constipation has well been called the ‘Mother of all Diseases’’ because of the number of ills that so often follow in the train of this disorder. Perhaps more troubles of the human body can be traced to constipa- tion than to any onedisease. Constipation is simply the failure of bowels tocast out from thebody the waste and therefuse thatareleft in the large intestine after the nutritive parts of the food have been assimilated. Simple neglect is one of the chief causes of constipation, and when once it has begun it is- likely to become chronic. The bowels are slaves to habit, and irregularity quickly starts trouble. "Constant sitting and lack of exercise, in- sufficent fluid taken with the food, and defeec- tive secretion of bile by the liver, are among the causes. the most chronic case of constipation can be relieved. 1. Local massage over the colon 10 minutes from right to left. 2. Standing bend- ing of knees (hands on hips.) 3. Flexion and extension of legs. 4. Percussion of back. 5. Lying flat on back with clasped hands back of head raise body to a sitting position (ten to twenty times.)
