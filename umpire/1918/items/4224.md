The regrettable defection—we could cheer- fully use a harsher term—at the last moment one of the two largest contributors to the Awmbulance Fund left the Committee in some- what of a hole on Thursday last, but matters were soon righted, and a sum more than large enough to cover the deficit made up in less than fifteen minutes. ‘‘Hop’’ stood ‘‘pat’’ on his two hundred, and added another ten dollars; Jake, who is so bravely ‘‘doing it all gave a hundred; ‘‘Col’’ Jake put twenty-five more in the pot; Bobby gave all he had left, twenty-three dollars; Abe saw his duty and did to the tune of twenty-five, and the Committee soon had the satisfaction of being able to announce that the crisis was past, and the Ambulance safe. We append a list of those who so gallantly step- ped into the breach, and we unhesitatingly name them as alike to Brutus, all honorable men.
