THE CURFEW BELL

The ringing of the curfew bell in ancient days was the signal for people to cover up their fires, put out their lights and go to bed. The purpose was to prevent fires, which were very common at the time, as most of the buildings were made of wood. William the Conqueror is supposed to have started this custom in Eangland. In the summer tume the bell was rang at sunset, and in the winter time at about 8 oâ€™clock. Every one who did not obey this signal was punished.
