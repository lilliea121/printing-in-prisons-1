HAS FOUND OPIUM SUBSTITUTE

A substitute for opium in medicines used in the treatment of asthma and other diseases has been discovered by Dr. David L. Macht, instructor in pharmacology at Johns Hopkins University, who described the new medicine at the eighty-ninth meeting of the Society for Experimental Biology and Medicine at City College.

The new therapeutic agent substituted for opium is known as benzyle benzolate. It is a common substance and a coal tar derivative. Dr. Macht has tested his discovery on animals, on himself and on students, and in all cases the reactions were favorable.

The new agent when used in the treatment of asthma, dysentery, intestinal colie and other diseases relaxes the muscles, giving to the patient the same beneficial effects as opium derivatives without the toxic effects and muscle contractions caused by opium.
