FOUR AMERICAN SOLDIERS SENTENCED TO BE SHOT

Unless President Wilson sees fit to set aside the verdict of a field court-martial, four American soldiers caught asleep while doing sentry duty in the trenches before the enemy in France, will have to face the firing squad. 

These are the first cases of the kind since the American troops went to France. One soldier has been executed there for an unspeakable offense, and in his case General Pershing acted swiftly without referring it to Washington.

In these cases, however, some extenuating circumstances may be found for the men, tired and nerve-worn by front-line trench duty in a hitherto unknown manner of warfare, to save them from the death penalty at the hands of their own fellows.

It is believed that the President will in the end review their cases. Going to sleep on sentry duty has long been recognized as an unforgivable offense punishable by death, and such cases, rare as they have been in the American army, have furnished some of the most absorbing incidents in its history.
