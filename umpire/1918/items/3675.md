THE BATTLE OF MAIDA

It is now one hundred and eleven years since an English army fought in Italy, and won the battle of Maida over the French.

Napoleon had vowed to conquer Sicily, and for that purpose the French pushed on into Calabria, and began to make extensive preparations. But the English forces for the defence of Sicily prepared to deal a blow on the mainland. A force of 5,000 men landed in the Bay of Euphemia, and the battalions of the French fell before the bayonets of the British. Napoleonâ€™s hopes were shattered at a stroke. But the "daily-breader" from Kilburn, travelling into London by way of the Edgware Road, never suspects as he passes by Maida Hill and Maida Vale the origin of the name.
