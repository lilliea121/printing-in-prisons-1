HAWAII MENACED BY VOLCANO

Late news reports from Honolulu, state that Kilauea volcano, the largest active crater in the world, is manifesting unusual activity. The immense lake is reported to be within eighteen feet of the top of the crater.

Prof. T. E. Jaggar, Jr., director of the volcano observatory, predicted today that the lava would overflow.

Kilauea volcano is situated in the south-eastern part of the Island of Hawaii, approximately 180 miles from this city.

Unusual activity of the volcano was reported in February, 1917. At that time the pit was a lake of fire many acres in extent, casting its glow at night miles out to sea. A few months earlier the pit was inactive.
