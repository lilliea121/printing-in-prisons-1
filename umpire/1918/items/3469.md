PREHISTORIC IRRIGATION DISCLOSED

Writing from a mining camp in the west a correspondent informs us the remains of irrigation systems that date back to prehistoric times, when the valleys of Arizona were inhabited by lightly civilized Indian tribes, are still in existence. One of the most famous of these is on the state highway, running from Prescott to the Grand Canyon. Water is taken from what is known as Montezumaâ€™s well, a curious natural well 440 feet in diameter and ninety-three feet deep, except one spot, where no bottom has been reached at 500 feet. Lime in solution is carried by the water, and the sides of the ditch have been preserved by the petrification of the original earth.
