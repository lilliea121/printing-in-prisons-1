REV. MICHAEL A. O’KANE, S. J.

It is with deep regret that we record the death of the Rev. Michael A. O’Kane, S. J., who passed from this life on Wednesday last, at St. Vincent’s Hospital, Worcester, Mass. For a number of years he was a priest at the Church of the Gesu, this city, and until recently was Catholic chaplain at this institution, where he won the hearts of all.

Shortly before leaving here to attend an anniversary banquet given at Worcester, there was a celebration at the Eastern Penitentiary in honor of his golden jubilee, and his sudden sickness and death came as a shock to his large circle of friends.

At one time Father O’Kane was president of the Holy Cross College in Worcester, Mass., and he enjoyed the distinction of building O’Kane Hall at that place. Besides other honors, Father O’Kane was a missionary for fourteen years and traveled extensively through the country, preaching with eloquent and unusual success in many places.

In addition to his winning personality, Father O’Kane possessed a clear, sonorous voice with power of appeal that won him many converts to the Mother Church.

In the loss of Father O’Kane the church looses a noble son who will be greatly missed by those who had the good fortune to know him.
