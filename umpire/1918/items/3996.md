MORE ABOUT PRISONS

Minnesota already has a prison farm, and Iliinois is about to build a State prison on wide acreage. In Colorado, Oregon, and Washington hundreds of prisoners from State institutions are working on road camps.

Other Western States are also discussing the prison farm movement, while in most of the Southern States prisoners are working on contract labor, either in minee or on the roads or plantations. Indeed throughout the country wherever new prisons are being considered facilities for outdoor work by the inmates are a primary consideration.
