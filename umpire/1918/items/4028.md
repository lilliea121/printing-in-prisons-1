The Messrs. Robert J., John W., and Reuben C. McKenty have spent the larger portion of the past week in West Chester, whence they escorted two of our number who were called as witnesses as in the so-called “Fifth Ward’’ trials. They report a pleasant trip, differing widely with us, whose memories of the place are anything but pleasant.
