NATIONAL SPIRIT LACKING

A distinguished Buddhist priest, Rev. Shaku Soen, has recently returned to Japan after a long stay in China and publishes an article in the Tokio Kokumin in whick China is described as he studied her from political as well as religious viewpoints. He finds an absence of national unity—a small country if it be judged by national unity. The people, do not care for the Government. They have not ideas of nationality. They are wholly indifferent to the fate of the republic. Therefore, all national undertakings are on small scales. The alleged national army is pitifully inadequate; armies under direction of military governors of various provinces act independently of the central Government. Thus China can be said to be a big or a little country to suit the point of view of an observer.

China’s monetary system is in an indescribably confused condition. Although a semblance of system exists in education, organization is absent. Religiously, China is chaotic; Buddhism is declared to be in a state of decay, only formalities remain, the spirit of Buddhism having departed. This religious decay has contributed to political and social prostration throughout China.
