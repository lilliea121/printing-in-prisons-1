SALUTAMUS

Certainly a number of our readers will be interested to learn that Mr. Simonin, son of one of the best-loved of our King’s Daughter visitors, whom we enjoyed the pleasure of hearing prior to his first departure for France a year, or more, ago, and was at that time made an honorary member of the H. F. C., has been commissoned a Second Lieutenant in the National Army.

Mr. Simonin’s first service was in the American Ambulance; upon our entering the war, he sought to enlist in the Aviation Corps but was prevented from doing so by a slight defect of vision. He returned to France in August last, serving in the Disbursing Dept. of the Aviation Service at Paris. Upon the recommendation of the Head of the Service he has atlast won to his goal of active service, where we wish all honor and success, and only wish it was our luck to follow him “over the top.”
