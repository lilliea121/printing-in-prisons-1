CHEAPER GASOLINE

Louis Bond Cherry, a Kansas City inventor, called on Secretary of the Navy Daniels, recently, announced his ability to increase the gasoline production of the United States from 3,000,000,000 to 9,000,000,000 gallons a year, and offered to furnish “gas” to the Government at 6¢ a gallon. Cherry submitted samples and the report of a committee of scientists who have examined his process and given it their approval.

“But for the shortage of materials, electrical apparatus, and the like,” he said, "I could have my apparatus installed in every refinery in the country, trebling the gasoline production, inside of a year.”
