U. S. WANTS 100,000 MEN FOR NAVAL RESERVE SERVICE

It is announced in a recent dispatch from Washington that the Government is seeking 100,000 men between 18 and 21 and those past 31 years, to enlist in the U. S Naval Reserve service. Lieutenant Commander Frederick R Payne, senior enrolling officer of the Naval Reserve Recruiting Station, in this city, has been instructed to use every endeavor to enlist men for service at home and abroad, and to work as mechanics andhelpers in the Naval Aircraft Factory at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, in the auxiliary service, and for duty in connection with submarine patrols and in fact all branches of the service. Special attention being paid to those who desire immediate service abroad or afloat in foreign waters. Those making such request will receive assignments at once, and if not fully qualified at present they will be intensively trained so that they may get such asssignment as early as possible.

As the Government order states, there is practically no class of skilled artisan or clerical work that cannot be utilized immediately. The aviation service at home and abroad requires the most men at the present time. Under existing conditions no branch of the service offers quicker and greater opportunity for advancement than the Naval Reserve service.
