THE WALL

There’s such a tiny bit of blue, 
Within the wall;
The sunbeam that comes stealing thru, 
Is oh! so small.
A bird that flutters swiftly by,
A wind that passes like a sigh,
A cloudlet sailing, slow and high, 
Without the wall.

Without, there’s odors of the Spring, 
White lilies tall;
And violet, and arbutus bring 
Their treasures all;
To scatter them with lavish hand,
By woodland way, and river strand;
It is a green, and smiling land, 
Without the wall.

The autumn rains, the winter snows, 
Unheeded fall;
But when the South wind wakes the Rose, 
What voices call?
The white roads winding o’er the lea;
The white sails fading out to sea;
The far, blue hills are calling me, 
Without the wall.

Ah! would that it were but a dream, 
And that were all.
To ’waken in the morning gleam, 
Without the wall.
And know the Present all transformed;
The Past, a memory to be mourned;
The Future, as a bride adorned; 
Without the wall.
