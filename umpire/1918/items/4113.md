A WORD FROM FRANCE

We quote below from the letter of a former Director of the local Red Cross Forces, who is now pursuing his work of mercy in France.

My dear C ' ' '

“Well, after my arrival over-seas, I took a three days journey and arrived at the big tent, and I wish that you were here with us. It is a wonderful country, and just the place for a fellow to live in all his life, not a wooden fence to be seen anywhere. All boundaries between properties are marked off by little hedges, and no matter how poor the family, they have their little plot of ground. We are located in a dandy spot, and have a wonderful view of the country-side with i s’' quaint old church, and stone houses. I‘m feeling fine and enjoying tke climate. Write me and tell me how the Red Cross Unit is doing, and how the ‘‘Home Defence’’ squad is drilling. You may recall St. C ' ' ' ' ' a chap of the 1918 class, who took a post-graduate course. Well I met him over here, and under stand he is getting along fine with his contingent.

Well, old pal, I can’t write much more and military news is barred; so I will close now with my sincerest wishes for your health, and the hope that the sun is shining for you today. From your old chum M ' ' ' '.
