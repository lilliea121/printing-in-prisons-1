TO LOCATE AIR MAIL STATION NEAR LEAGUE ISLAND

A Washington correspondent writes that an air mail station will probably be located on the flat lands near League Island. This much is admitted as the result of the city-wide tour of Otto Praeger, Second Assistant Postmaster General; Postmaster Thornton, Major B. F. Castle, U. S. S. C.; Major N. W. Peck, U. S. A. C.; and Mayor Smith and members of the Chamber of Commerce.

The party looked several sites over, but appeared keen over the League Island prospects because of the approaches along the boulevard which will enable motor trucks to deliver their loads to the base without fear of being tied up by traffic.

It is hoped to have the airline in operation within six weeks.
