USES MOTOR TO DRIVE CATTLE

A late news item announces a new use for a motorcar has been found by a cattle dealer in one of the middle western states, whose business compels him to drive extensive herds of meat on the hoof along the roads. 

During the hottest part of the summer this purveyor determined to drive his animals by night in order to spare them the inevitable suffering that attended such operations in the middle of the day. Getting in his car, he started the herd ahead of him in the road, and by throwing the searchlight before and honking his horn he kept the animals moving quickly in the compact mass.

There are instances of the use of the motorcar in round-up work in the far west, so that the traditional picture of a cowboy astride a bucking broncho may have to give way to one of that leather-breeched gentleman cuddled down into the wheel of a flexible run-about, his lasso presumably dangling over the windshield.
