OAK FIRST WOOD FOR TABLES

Oak was the wood first used in tables then walnut came into general use in the middle of the seventeenth century. An early form of table was the chair table, convenient because it served the purpose of a seat when the top was lifted and stood against the side of the room. But gradually the table took its present form and use. It became the custom to leave the board upon the trestle instead of removing both, and in time the piece of furniture was called the table.
