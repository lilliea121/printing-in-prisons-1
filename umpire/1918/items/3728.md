A WIG OF GLASS 

It is announced that in Venice they are spinning glass for commercial purposes, converting it into glass cotton and glass wool 4 pressed into sheets or pads. Although the principal use of the product at present is for insulation, we have the word of the Italian makers that it serves admirably for making artificial hair, wigs, perukes, doll’s hair, Santa Claus beards and other hirsute adornments. The processes of manufacture are simple. Solid glass rods, made of pure American soda that contains no adulteration of lead or other metal, are worked into fluff under a Bunsen burner and blowpipe. A bicycle wheel, minus the tire, winds up the threads. If the threads are sufficiently fine they curl up and fluff out like wool. The product is now marketed in three forms— glass cotton, glass wool, and in sheets about a half-inch thick, which resembles white felt pads. In the last form mentioned it may be used to make separators for accumulators of electricity.
