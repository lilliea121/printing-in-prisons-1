A PATRIOT’S GAZETEER

From the old-fashioned towns with the funny names; 
‘Way up in the hill, or ’way out on the plains, 
They go marching away to the war. 
They’ve heard the call in Accokeek 
They’re arming there to-day. 
In Bemidji, and Battle-Creek, 
They’re mustering for the fray. 
From Chattanooga, and Cheyenne, 
And Chicopee they come; 
Alike from Devil’s Lake to Dan, 
They answer to the drum. 
Eureka bids Equality, 
With Friendship to unite, 
With Freedom, and Fraternity, 
And Good Heart for the fight: 
And Home, and Hope’s in Harmony, 
With Independence, quite. 
There’s Jefferson, and Jackson, 
Will join with Kalamazoo, 
In proving to the Kaiser, 
Just what Uncle Sam can do. 
In Loyalty to Liberty, 
Our Lincolns yield to none; 
And Matteawan joins Manistee, 
In ‘‘strafing’’ of the Hun. 
And Newark answers Oswego, 
With many a Prioneer; 
And Quality is Quick to show; 
And Rough and Ready’s here. 
With Salt Creek ready for the foe, 
And also Troublesome; 
While Tar-Heel sticks to Union, 
Sure Victory must come. 
With Washington, and Wilson, 
Stands Xenia, You Bet,”
And Zero, should the foemen come, 
They’d find the hottest yet! 
O best little towns on God’s green earth! 
—By the blood of your sons you have proven your worth— 
You are well worth dying for.
