THE APPROACHING COMET

So many other things are coming along to take the attention of humanity that there is a possibility of overlooking the comet of gigantic size that is now, according to astronomers, approaching this solar system at a speed of 1,134,246 miles a day.

Halleyâ€™s comet, which appeared in 1911, and disappointed people principally by reason of the flimsiness of its texture, was large enough to be seen through the great telescopes eight months before perihelion, or its closest approach to the sun; but the visitor now on the way was seen fourteen months before being due to attain the corresponding position, its discovery having been made in April, 1916.

The comet will, it is announced, be at its best and brightest in June, and it will be welcome if it shall fulfil in magnificence even a part of all that is promised in the advance notices.
