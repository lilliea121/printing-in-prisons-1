THE DEPUTY WARDEN .

In previous issues of the UMPIRE we have read extracts taken from outside publica- tions defining the many dutiesof a Warden, as well as a prison Chaplain, and we were greatly surprised to hear of the many respon- sibilities, that we had had no idea of at all rested upon the shoulders of these two offi- cials. ’

But if all the numerous duties of a Deputy Warden could be made known we would probably be more surprised, and if but half acquainted with all that he has to put up with during the length of a day, we would also probably be less ready to criticise, for when one considers that among 1400 convicts one almost meets with as many different temperaments and whims, and that not a day goes by without at least a hundred or more are clamoring for something, prisoners as well as Keepers, and that it is up to the Deputy Warden to listen to them all, and to decide impartially, and as far as possible to. pacify them all, one can get a small idea of how his patience must be tried. Itis up to him to find quarters for every newcomer, to separate and pacify those who can not get along together, to see that justice is done to those who are wronged, to investigate and decide all complaints to mete outpunishment or to forgive, and in a hundred different other capacities run the gauntlet of criti- cism and comment,—his job is indeed no sinecure,—and it takes a strong and able man to fill it—.

Therefore realizing that a few words of praise while alive are a thousand times mere app1o- priate and welcome than a whole page after This little tribute is paid today. As "Bob" Meyers, our Deputy Warden is a disciplinarian, who like the sailor expects for everything, and who knows from his twenty- five years experience among convicts that strict, but just rules and the obedience of same, is the only way to remould one into manhood,—and though he at times may seem rude and unjust to some, it is undoubtedly to their best interest, and again, only those who are not fair to themselves and to their neighbors, and whose conscience bothers them, need fear to be hauled before his judgement seat,—so if you play fair, you will find in ‘“Bob’’ as good a friend as you want to have, and if you meet him with the smile of honesty, he will smile with you,— but if your countenance expresses the evi- dence of a lie, then you might receive from him what you justly deserve,—and that is as it should he.— B—7401
