INVENTED THE MOVIE FILM

Watching for three hours the unreeling of a stupendous film, one notonly marvels where this art will end, but where it began, says a writer. It may almost be said to have begun in the pulpit, for although the idea was in the toy called the ‘‘wheel of life,” yet without the photographic film the cinematograph would have been impossible, and that was, according to the judgment of the United States Supreme court, the inventicn of Rev. Hannibal Goodwin.

Mr. Goodwin was pastor of the Episcopal church in Newark, N. J., and was a great lover of children, although he had none of his own. He was always scheming for their enjoyment, and it was in order to make a picture machine to amuse his Sunday school that he turned his attention to photegraphic films, the secret of which he discovered in the early eighties of the last century.

He made the films in the old rectory, and sometimes he went directly from the pulpit to the laboratory in his vestments. He resigned his pastorate in 1888, but it was not for ten years later that he obtained his patent. He was about to put his films on the market when he met with anaccidental death in 1900. Mr. Goodwin got nothing out of an invention which has made tens of millions.
