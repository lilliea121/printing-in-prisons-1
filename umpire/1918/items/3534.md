HOW MUCH GENUINE AMERICANISM?

Many of us have a running idea that much which has been taken for granted in the past as to our efficiency and industrial supremacy, has had its source from an over sanguine disposition to take things at their face value, and accredit worth where it did not actually exist, other than in the minds of a few favored ‘‘captains of industry.”’

Undoubtedly many of us have been filling our thoughts with this sort of over confidence the larger part of our lives. “We have been trying to seem what we are not— to look richer, wiser; and more important than providence and fortune have made us.” This may seem a harmless bit of pretense, usually leads to-undue- extravagance and’ to our social-and-financial ruin in-the end.

At the present time there is a new brand of pretense ‘‘thats insidious and dangerous in this country that we might ecall patriotic pretense,’’ avers a well-known author. As we see it, the German propagandist acclaimed himself as an apostle of democracy; the unfaithful Senator declares himself as a watch-dog of the treasury, an entertainer of extravagances and a guardian of the sacred rights of the people over legislative tricksters who seek to have enacted laws for the benefit of the few over the many. Then there is the profiteer, who fortifies himself with a few liberty bonds in order that he may pose as a patriot; while at the same time he seeks to hide his nefarious motives under the plea, ‘‘because of the war.” There follows numerous others who lie awake nights to think out some scheme to "put it over the other fellow" under the cry of "because of the war,” so there will be no chance for a “come back.”

As a contemporary aptly remarks, "there is about seven hundred and seventy-seven brands of patriotic bluff going the rounds at the present time,” while many of the bluffers try to deceive themselves into “believing they are useful and loyal Americans.

No indeed, the ‘‘con artist’’ is not dead but very much alive, ‘‘and now is an excellent time for everybody to take a searching look at themselves and their neighbors and discover just how much is genuine Americansm and how much is paint.”
