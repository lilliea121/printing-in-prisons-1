TRAMPS SCARCE IN WAR
Are Virtually Blotted Out of Northwest by Work-or-Fight Order,

Work has virtually blotted out the grimy trail of the professional tramp in the Northwest, according to railroad officials and officials of States from Minnesota to the Western Coast.

The Northwestern tier of States, long the summer playground of thebox car transient, have so rigorously enforced the “work or fight’’ order and other war measures, that the tramps, who formerly appeared in droves after having wintered in the cities, have been reduced to a few lone stragglers.

‘‘And the demand for labor is so keen that town policemen and village constables are quick to draft these stragglers and put them to work,’’ declared an official of a railroad with headquarters here,

“The armed guards about railroad yards, bridges and tunnels have also been a thorn in the side of the care-free wanderer. He is in constant danger of becoming a target while loafing about his old haunts.”

In past years towns which were the headquarters of farm laborers were packed with professional gamblers, gunmen and thugs, who devised various schemes of fleecing the worker out of his money. They mingled with the men, wore the clothes of the worker and could be weeded out by officials only with difficulty.

The war has, in the opinion of the authorities, sounded the death knell of this small army, which annually reaped a golden harvest.
