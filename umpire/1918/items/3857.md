This week is Red Cross Week; another $100,000,000 is needed. Come across! Also it marks the opening of the War Chest for contributions; and the giving of a day’s pay, monthly, would be doing about as much as could be expected. Even the pennies count in this war. The War Chest, so called, is simply a General Fund for war work, upon which all Organizations doing such work may draw when necessary, thus doing away with constant, and often conflicting, collections, by lumping them all in one continuing one. Let’s all contribute. It’s our only way of helping.
