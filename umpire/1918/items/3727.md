BLACK HILLS OF DAKOTA

The Black Hills of the Dakotas are in many ways our most beautiful bit of scenery, describes a writer. Lacking the grandeur of the Rockies, they have a glamour of isolated loveliness which gives them the charm of the Mplace cut off and secludedâ€”the charm that belongs to lonely islands and to the little towns of the northern wilderness. The Black Hills are a mountain islet in a sea of plain. They have the streams, the forests and the storms of the Rockies and in their Bad Lands they have the fantastic wind carven buttes and mesas of the painted desert and the Grand canyon. Also, nowadays they have auto roads.
