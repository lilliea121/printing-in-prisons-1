WEDNESDAY P. M. BIBLE SCHOOL

Chaplain Joseph Welch’s Bible Class held its regular weekly meeting on Wednesday afternoon April 24. In the absence of Chaplain Welch who was getting Liberty Bonds for some of the boys, our friend, Mr. Frank Dipple, took personal charge. After recitation of the Lord’s prayer, and responsive reading of the day’s lesson, Mr. Dipple introduced Rev. Dr. J. G. Bickerton, pastor of the M. E. Union Church, of this city, and a very promiment member of the Phila. M. E. Conference. Rev. Bickerton proved to be up to the high standard of all those whohave preceeded him at these meetings, and his talk, on the ‘‘Transfiguration of Christ,” was worth going miles to hear. We hope Rev. Dr. Bickerton enjoyed being with us and we hope he may come in again. The singing by the attending inmates, and especially the singing of the Episcopal Choir was of more than usual merit, and brought forth congratulations from both Dr. Bickerton and Mr. Dipple.
