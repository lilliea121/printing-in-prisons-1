SEMPER FIDELIS

O ye who stand in the battle-line, 
And hold the lists for France; 
Whose blood the cannons drink like wine, 
When the Stars and Stripes advance: 
We do but reach you a helping hand, 
But were we not by a custom banned, 
We would give ourselves - and beside you stand - 
Instead of an Ambulance.

May brother, or son, or friend of ours, 
Be glad of the thing we do; 
Be spared by it all the bitter hours,
That wounded men live thru: 
When the stricken field is a mumurous hell, 
Of groans and curses, and prayers that tell, 
How men by thousands there fought, and fell, 
For a Cause that they held true. 
Gladly we give, and gladly we’d die, 
For the Flag on the fields of France; 
And over the Rhine we would carry it high 
To Berlin, had we but the chance. 
But while we wait for the day to come, 
When they’ll give us hammer, or spade or gun 
And we’re working, or fighting to beat the Hun, 
We’ll give it an Ambulance.
