PLAY IS HALF OF LIFE

Groos, the sociologist, showed that play, in the history of the race and the development of the individual, is a preparation for the serious business of life. The instinct of play is deeply rooted in human nature. It is not. to be denied without certain malformation ot character. Indeed, it cannot be denied, but only perverted. It is active from childhood to adult life, and work itself, unless the play element is in it, becomes nothing but sterile drudgery, says the Evening Telegraph. 

These are the bare facts of social and psychological science concerning the problem which the Government, with the aid of the Y. M. C. A., the War Camp Community Recreation Service and other civilian organizations, is meeting by the provision of play activities for the soldiers and sailors in the training camps. Play—and the word is broad and comprehensive—is indispensible to physical, mental and moral health, to efficiency and morale. But the measures taken and planned are not designed merely as prophylactics, or simply as a means of promoting fitness for the trenches, but also as a part payment of the debt we owe to the men the nselves. We gave them work todo. We give them play because they crave it and deserve it.
