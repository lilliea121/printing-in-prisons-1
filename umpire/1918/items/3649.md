FOUND SUBSTITUTE FOR ANTHRACITE

A New York correspondent writes of the invention of a new process for converting bituminous coal into a new feul to be called carbocoal —which is said to be the equal of anthracite coal—is announced by C. H. Smith, a coal mining engineer. It is asserted that the new feul is smokeless, very hard and dense in structure and occupies approximately the same space as run of mine coal. The inventor says that it will go as long a way toward increasing the supply of smokeless fuel for domestic use and will afford, for the first time, a fuel that will burn without smoke and still permit the high steaming rates neccessary in modern railway, marine and power operating. A corporation, to be known as the International Coal Products Corporation, of which the inventor is the president, has been formed to put the new product on the market.

The process, bluntly, takes the raw coal and, through simple and economical methods seperates the rich oils from the pure carbon and in turn presses into convenient shape for use the carbon, which is being today commercially used for household and powerplant purposes. A method of coal distillation at relatively low temperatures is used, in which there is simultaneously extracted from the coal a soft quantity of coal-tar products to offset largely the cost of converting the raw cval into a refined smokeless product.
