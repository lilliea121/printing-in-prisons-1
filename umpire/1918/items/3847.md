JUDGE WADHAMS IN FRANCE

Judge William H. Wadhams of the Court of General Sessions, who organized the Society of Soldiers’ Families in America to back up the United States in the war, arrived in England recently. He will go to France and confer with Gen. Pershing before returning home.

The object of the visit of Judge Wadhams to England and France is two-fold. He believes that the 150,000 convicts now behind prison bars in this country should be put to work to help the American soldiers now in France. Judge Wadhams contends that the convicts could be transported to France and their labor utilized behind the fighting lines in stevedore and other work.

Under the existing regulations of the United States service a felon cannot be accepted for service. But if Judge Wadhams reports favorably on the practicability of using convicts abroad it is possible that the regulations may be altered so that conviects who desire to do so may be organized into battalions or regiments by themselyes and sent abroad for work behind the lines in road building, repairing equipment or tasks along other lines.
