SOME SYMPATHETIC LOVING POWER

"I do not undertake to say 
That literal answers come from heaven, 
But I know this; that when I pray
A comfort and support is given 
That helps me rise o’er earthly things 
As larks soar up on airy wings. 

“In vain the wise philosopher 
Points out to me my fabric flaws; 
In vain the scientists of earth
That all things are controlled by laws, 
My life has taught me day by day 
That it availeth much to pray. 

“I do not stop to reason out 
The why and how, I do not care, 
Since I know this, that when I doubt, 
Life seems a blackness of despair, 
The world a tomb; and when I trust 
Sweet blossoms spring up in the dust. 

“Since I know in the darkest hour 
If I lift up my soul in prayer 
Some sympathetic, loving power 
Sends hope and comfort to me there; 
Since balm is sent to ease my pain, 
What need to argue or explain? 

“Prayer has the sweet refining grace, 
It educates the soul and heart, 
It lends a luster to the face, 
And by its elevating art 
It gives the mind an inner sight 
And brings it near the Infinite.”
