SOLID FACTS WHICH THE GOOD FOLKS DON'T SEEM TO GET AROUND That Washington swore a blue streak sometimes, while in the thick of battle. That Bob Ingersoll died a beautiful death-- something that can't be accounted for. That Grant drank so heavily-his generalship saved the Union. That Colonel Goethals built the Panama Canal smoking cigarettes. Ask him. That Lincoln used to crack jokes of a nature that probably wouldn't pass muster at a Suffrage Purity Club. Just think of the harm this man accomplished! That the piles of dead bodies which had stopped the enemy's invasions were not all Sunday-school boys. That if it had't been for all the aforesaid sinners, the immaculate ones â€˜would never be enjoying their safety and freedom of speech which they so injudiciously use. Thank God for the sinners who rushed in where the self-sainted feared to tread.
