THE TRUE GUIDE

You may bring to your office and put in a frame 
A motto as fine as its paint, 
But if you’re a crook when you’re playing the game 
That motto won’t make you a saint. 
You can stick up placards all over the hall, 
But here is the word I announce 
It isn’t the motto that hangs on the wall, 
But the motto you live that counts. 
If the motto says ‘‘Smile’” and you carry a frown, 
“Do It Now’’ and linger and wait; 
If the motto says ‘‘Help’’ and you trample men down, 
If the motto says ‘‘Love’” and you hate: 
You won’t get away with the motto you stall, 
For the truth will come forth with a bounce— 
It isn’t the motto that hangs on the wall, 
But the motto you live that counts.
