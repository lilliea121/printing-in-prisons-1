RAISING SHIPS BY AIR

A novel method of salvaging sunken ships has been devised by Dr. Sylvio Pellico Portella, of Rio de Janeiro. The invention consists of a specially built tender which carries collapsible floats made of waterproof material.

The fioats occupy very little space until they are put into use and inflated. They are constructed in such a manner that they will assume a number of different shapes when they are inflated.

Taken down to the wreck by divers, they are attached to the vessel both inside and outside and are connected with the tender by lines of hose. When in place they are inflated by air pressure from the tender. As they swell they displace the water frcm within as well as from without, and their buoyancy causes the wreck to float upward to the surface.
