TWO GREAT STATESMEN

Beginning nearly the same date the world beheld an empire of Germany and a kingdom of Italy reviving the old glories of a distant past and giving a national character and a national spirit to millions who had long cherished a common language and common habits of life.

Two great statesman were foremost in the achievement of that splendid historical result, Bismarck in Germany, Cavour in Italy, says the Youth’s Companion. Both were men of the highest genius, of wide insight, of profound diplomatic skill and of indisputable patriotism. But their aims were totally different. Bismarck had no faith in the people and sought to make an absolute empire on the medieval model of fixed classes, each working in its sphere for the good of the state, and the whole culminating in a God appointed, God supported monarchy. Cavour, although he believed it best to retain the monarchical form, worked from the beginning to establisha thoroughly modern democracy; a government that should be essentially of the people, by the people and for the people.

Bismarck summed up histheory of government in the celebrated phrase that power must be sustained ‘‘by blood and iron.” Cavour said of himself in a phrase far more deserving of celebrity, ‘‘I am the child of liberty, and to liberty I owe all I am.” The hearts of modern Germany and modern Italy are disclosed in those two sayings of their greatest sons, and we can see today what different results are produced by different teachings.
