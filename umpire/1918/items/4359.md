GERMANY SIGNS AND WE WRITE FREE VERSE We write this to the music —Glad, great, glorious music— Of ten thousand whistles, Crying "Victory!" thru the night; And we're wonderfully happy, That it's all over, Over there. We win, And the boys will be coming back; And we're magnificently sad, That we didn't get in it; And our tears persist In gathering on our nose, Instead of running down our cheeks, As they should do, And we want to yell Like a three-year old; And our dignity won't let us, So we're simply in a ______ of a fix, But we're better off than Germany, She's licked! We may be here for a good ten years; And— We may be here for longer; Or we may go out, Via the Seventh Block corner; Whatever happens, We don't care! For we're free. Free of the menace of the Hun. Free of all the years to come: Fear of the dread and fear of Kings, And Kaisers. And we know this, That never again, Will we have so glad a waking; Because we won't have to whip Germany Twice in a lifetime; She'll stay licked! B 8266
