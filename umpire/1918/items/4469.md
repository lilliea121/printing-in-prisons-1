No Hurry The telephone bell rang with anxious persistence. The doctor answered the call. "Yes?" he said. "Oh, doctor," said a worried voice, "something has happened to my wife. Her mouth seems set and she can't say a word." "Why, she may have lockjaw," said the medical man. "Do you think so? Well, if you are up this way sometime next week, I wish you would step in and see what you can do for her."
