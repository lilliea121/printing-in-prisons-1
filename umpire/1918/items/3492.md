JAMS BY THE MILE

So enormous has the business of jam making become in Dundee, Scotland, since the great firms there organized to. supply preserves to the British army and navy that according to a report sent by E. R. Pottle, U. S. vice counsel there, to the department of commerce, the tins in which they put up one week’s supply alone ‘‘would, if stood end on end, form a column fully 40 miles high. It is no unusual thing for this firm to deal with 100,000,000 oranges, and all kinds of fruit are dealt with on a similar scale.”

The Dundee manufactures are about to give up the use of earthernware, glass jars and tins, for a stout cardboard container is now being made and experiments with it have proved highly successful.
