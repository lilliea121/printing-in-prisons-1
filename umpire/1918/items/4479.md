A perfect model of our institution 8x8 feet, made by a convict in here, and which was sent to the Panama Exhibition at San Diego Cal. a couple of years ago was returned to this institution a short while ago with an "Honorable Mention" attached, and is now placed in our library. The builder is now on parole, and we hope that this bit of news, if it ever comes his way, will not arouse his vanity and curiosity, and cause him to come back merely to see once more his beloved model.
