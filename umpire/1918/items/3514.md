RELICS OF SAXON KINGS

Capt. Vaughan Williams of Old Windsor has discovered what he believes to be the site of the palace of the Saxon kings and the pre-conquest town of Windsor. It is believed that there once stood at Old Windsor the palace of Edward the Confessor, but although several Saxon urns have been excavated here from time to time the actual position of the palace has never been decided. 

Tighe and Davis, in their "Annals of Windsor," say that Old Windsor was probably selected by the Saxon kings as a residence for the same reason as it was subsequently repurchased by William the Conqueror, on account of its convenience for hunting in the forest. The lands of Windsor, granted by Edward the Confessor and exchanged by the abbot of Westminster with William, appear to have had reference to Old Windsor, and did not include the site of the present town or castle. King William held Old Windsor as his own demesne.
