A GREAT RUBBER PRODUCER

The Malay peninsula is the largest rubber-producing and rubber-exporting country in the world. Ten years ago the production was small, as compared with that of Brazil, which was then the principal source of supply.

Its advent to first place as a rubber-producing country is due to its favorable climatic and soil conditions.
