THREE YEARS MORE OF WAR

Governor Charles H. Brough, of Arkansas, declares that it is the opinion of official Washington that there will be three years more of war. He made this statement in a speech at the Congress of National Service of the National Security League. It was in connection with his declaration that a conservation and educational programme must be adopted in order to win the war.

"I was in Washington recently,’’ he said, “and it is the opinion of men there that this war will last three years longer. Germany in some respects is stronger than she was three years ago. She has 13,000,000 square miles of territory and six times the food acreage that she formerly did. She will also come into possession of large munition factories because of the collapse of the Russian Government.
