BEATING BACK 

We sincerely believe that there never was a better time than the present for doingthat little thing of ‘‘beating back.” The average employer is very sparing now of criticising an applicant’s past; and only pauses to make certain that you possess a reasonable quantity of legs, and arms, befcre grasping you warmly by the hand, and introducing you to a good, fat job. In our humble opinion, the man who will come back here in this day and hour, and say he didn‘t have a chance, deserves to be shot at sunrise—the first sunrise after his return. Harsh language, but we mean it.
