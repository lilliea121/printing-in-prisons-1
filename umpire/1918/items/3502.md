RADIO DIRECT TO FRANCE

Late news from Washington announces that direct radio communication between Washington and American Army headquarters in France will be made possible this year with the completion of the $2,250,000 radio now being built in France by the Navy Department, which has charge of all radio communication. At the close of the war under arrangements made, the station willbe taken over by the French Government.

Available French stations are not of sufficient power for transatlantic communication; at least on the scale desired by the United States.. As a result, the cables have been crowded with Government messages to and fro, even during the night hours. It is anticipated that the new station will be finished in August, and by working with the Arlington, Va., station or the new high-power plant at Annapolis, the radio system will afford quick relief.
