TO TUNNEL UNDER BRITISH CHANNEL

The proposal to construct a railway tunnel under the British channel is still under consideration. Mr. Asquith, former British premier, stated some time ago that the entire project with the modernized plans would be taken up before long, and a leading member of the house of commons stated that the plans for construction were so far advanced that work could begin wheneer the necessary legislation was secured. The estimated cost of the tunnel would be about $70,000,000 but even at that it is estimated that it would give a net return of 5 to 7 per cent on the investment and reduce the running time between London and Paris five and one-half hours.
