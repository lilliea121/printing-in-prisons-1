UNCLE GEORGE

Sunshine or rain one finds always: “Uncle George’’ in the same pleasant and jovial spirit. 

"Why should I bring my troubles and worries to a place where there is enough of it already; I am glad if I can bring in the mornings a bit of cheer and comfort to the boys; and then when I go home at night I feel so much better because of it.: These are the words and the spirit of Mr George Pierce, the gentle Overseer of the 12th Block. and it is this generous thought and evidence of sympathy that causes his smiling countenance. and which draws to bim so many friends among the Inmates of this institution

If a few more of his kind could be found a Keepers for the many country’s prisons’ the shady side of this world would grow brighter.

The star and stripe upon his sleeve indicate a long service and instead of allowirg the many years intercourse with convicts to harden his heart to their sadden lot’’ he has given it full opportunity to respond to their need of kindness and sympathy and that is why they greet him as "Uncle George’’ today- and that is why this little tribute is paid him’ that it might awaken in others a desire to become as he.
