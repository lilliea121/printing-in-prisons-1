WHY "BILL" CAME BACK Well by heck, why there is Bill,  Thought he went for good and all; Just went out the other morning, Said he never more would fall. Went around with face all beaming, Saying, "Well no more for me; I'm done with all this trouble, Nothing in it I can see." Now he's back, the same old story, "Sponsor gave me too much work; Fellow took me out of prison, And he made me shovel dirt. Then he made me hit the woodpile, Milk the cows and feed the horse, Run the churn and mind the baby, Around the stable do the chores, Throw down hay and cut up fodder, Feed the pigs and chickens too, Pick up stones and mow the meadow, Then wash dishes for Miss Sue. Well, by gum, I just got crazy, Took a sneak the second day; Went to town and got a hummer, Skipped without a cent of pay. Now I'm back but no more farming; Days may come and days may go; I would rather stay in prison, Eat potpie, than work a hoe." Spider
