THE E. S. P. GOES ON HONOR ROLL

We are 100% givers! The E. S. P. goes on the Honor Roll of Contributors to the War Chest Fund as such. Practically every man in the Institution who could do so contributed voluntarily to the Fund, and for those, who from financial embarassment, or other reasons, were prevented from giving, from doing the thing that they would have most wished to do, the Honor and Friendship Club came forward, and put down 10 cents for each man, so that all might figure in the list of givers.
