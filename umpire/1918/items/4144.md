AUBURN PRISON DONATES $1135

The Mutual Welfare League of Auburn Prison announces the contribution of $1135 to the Red Cross Fund for war purposes. This absolute gift represents the voluntary offerings of the inmates in the spirit of patriotism characteristic of prisoners in sympathy with chivalric ideas of human responibility.
