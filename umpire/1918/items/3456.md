TREMENDOUS ARTIFICIAL LIGHT

Perhaps the biggest artificial light in the world is the 50,000,000 candlepower light installed at the falls of Niagara. When the gigantic installation was made it was claimed to be the nearest approach to real sunshine ever devised by man, and that may be true. But it is interesting to ascertain, if possible, how much it fell short of the actual output of light by our great luminary, and, strangely enough, there are figures in existence which enable a comparison to be made. Yet it may be stated at once that these figures are so stupendous as to leave the human mind absolutely "in the dark.”

How many lights equal to the Niagara in. stallation would it require to match Dame Nature’s big installation which appearsabove the horizon so regularly day by day? More big figures! It would require 31,500,000,000,000 lights just as powerful as the biggest man has accomplished ‘‘on his own.” So even Uncle Sam will have to try again. The Niagara illumination is ‘‘some’’ light, but 0ld Sol is equal to three and one-half quintillions of them!
