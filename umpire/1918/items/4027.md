WE HOOVERIZE

The E. S. P. inmates joined the ranks of the food conservationists on Saturday last, when they voluntarily pledged themselves to see that no more bread should be wasted in this Institution.

There was nothing official about the movement, it being purely an inception of the inmate body, with B 8361 at it’s head; a concrete expression of their sincere desire to contribute their mite toward helping their country to win this war; an official support— tho not lacking—was neither asked, nor needed. There will be no restriction of the bread supply: the food hogs, should any survive, will still be free to exercise their genius for saving against a threatened ‘‘rainy day’’ which never comes, in here. The restriction will be entirely a voluntary action of the individual inmate, and he can either save, or waste, according to his nature.

A weeks preliminary testing of the plan, on the 11th Block, gave very promising results; the equivalent of some 700 loaves being saved, and should this ratio be maintained thru out the Institution, the country will be the gainer by several hundred barrels of flour yearly, and we none the worse, as the money saved on flour will naturally be devoted to the purchase of other foods. Let us all do our utmost to help in this most meritorious work of saving.
