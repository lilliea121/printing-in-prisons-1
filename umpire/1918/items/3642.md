ABOUT THE USE OF CEMENT

It is said that cement was first put on the market in England. It was still being imported into this country in 1875. It was at this time that the use of Portland cement in the United States came into commercial prominence. When the product was first placed on the market in competition with that which was being imported from England and Germany, a good price was demanded. However, production in excess of demand soon resulted and it proved a big factor in the price cutting that followed.
