PARENTS TO BLAME FOR DELINQUENT CHILDREN

A correspondent writes from Media, Pa., that Judge Isaac Johnson, in an address before the annual convention of the Delaware County School Directorsâ€™ Association, blamed parents for many of the cases of delinquent children who are brought into juvenile court for petty wrongs and incorrigibility. He said that boys and girls often go wrong in their tender years because of the lack of home training and because often they are not properly clothed.

Dr. John P. Garber, superintendent of public schools of Philadelphia, who was present, emphasized the necessity for a higher type of intelligence after the war and the necessity for a higher physical and mental manhood of the nation to meet demands which are sure to follow the war.

Doctor Garber said that there should be a definite program of activity to keep the youth in his home town instead of looking cityward, because the strengthening influence of home life must be preserved if the nation is to prosper.
