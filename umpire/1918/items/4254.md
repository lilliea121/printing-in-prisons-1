TOOLS

Once upon a time so the story goes, the devil was going to auction off his tools. So he sent out invitations and had the tools dis- played in a big hall. Many people came to see them. There were Jealousy, Hatred, Envy, Malice, Revenge, and many others of the same choice varieties. The people re- marked about the high prices asked for them

The devil told them they were allnecessary to his success. Finally someone noticed a little battered, bent old stool hanging in one corner. They wondered what it was, why - it shonld be there, and what was its price.

They looked and saw that its name wag DISCOURAGEMENT. Its price was more than all the rest put together. All were sur- prised and asked why it should be so high,

"Of course that tool is high," said the devil, "it is the best I have. Very often I fail with the others, then I pry thatone into the mind of the person I am working on.

If I can get it in, even a very little, it opens the door and the others rapidly follow.

That tool high? Oh. no! Its worth the price asked. If I couldn’t have but one, that’s

what I’d take every time. (Here the devil began to laugh.) The funny thing about it is, no one ever thinks that tool belongs to me." - Ex.
