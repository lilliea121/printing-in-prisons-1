NEW STYLE VIOLIN

An entire departure from the conventional lines of violin construction has been made in an instrument for which patents have recently been granted to an Illinois inventor, Robert L. Yeakey. The body of the violin is cylindrical in form. However, the sound post and bass-bar in a modified form are necessarily retained. The instrument is provided with a chin rest, so shaped as to be extended laterally while in use and of folding against the instrument when not in use.

The appearance of the violin is most extraordinary, but it is said that.the quality and volume of tone is the equal of that found in hand-made violins of conventional construction. The peculiar form involves a simplification in the mode of manufacture and admits of instruments being made almost wholly by machinery, while still possessing excellent tone quality.
