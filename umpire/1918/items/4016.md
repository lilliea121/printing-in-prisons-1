TO A PORTRAIT OF MISS C______.

Dear little lady, had I tongue to flatter, 
A rosy future I would paint for you;
With lovers mad for you as any hatter, 
Or as March hare, too.
Sighing all the night long windows 
Singing of your beauty to the stars:
I will only say, I’ve seen your likeness, 
And—I curse the bars.

I would be some score of years the younger, 
Walk with you a—down some April lane; 
Tho as courtier I was ever bungler,
I would try again.
Haply when the fire fly lamps were litten, 
And the dew lay heavy on the grass;
You would watch with me the gold stars mirrored, 
In the water’s glass.

I would speak no word of love, or longing; 
I, who scarce would dare to take your hand;
Stainless as the lilies that are thronging,
All the river’s strand.
I would play the pale, despairing lover, 
Worshiping, yet knowing it but vain;
As the moths around the night-lamps hover, 
Careless of the flame:

So I’d hang upon your lightest saying; 
Dance, and grimace, but to see you smile,
Glad to be the comrade of your playing,
For a little while.
Little lady, ’tis but idle dreaming,
I shall ne’er see but your pictured face:
Yet to me that one brief moment’s seeming, 
Gives new heart of grace.
