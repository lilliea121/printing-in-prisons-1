A WORD OF THANKS

I wish to tender to each and every one of my fellow Inmates, who have contributed so generously to the Fund which has been raised to help me in my fight for freedom, my most sincere thanks for their generous action.

I would gladly call, and thank each one of you personally; for such tangible evidence of your good will means much to me, but the task would be to great, considering the number of those who have 80 honored me, and I must needs content myself with thanking you collectively. It is a very generous thought, and deed; and it is my sincere hope that you will not have given in vain.

With very best wishes to every one of you, I am 

A 8432.
