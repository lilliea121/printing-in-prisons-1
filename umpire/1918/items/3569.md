GOOD LUCK AND TIDY SHOES

The Australian natives know nothing of shoes, and the natives of Africa are in the same box to this day. The Chinese make their shoes of wood and paper, and cannot remember when they began to make them. A Chinese shoe is warm in winter and cool in summer, and always easy to the foot.

Superstition has busied herself greatly about shoes; but it is not worth while to cite all the silly sayings about them. There is no significance about the way people wear their shoes, either at heel, toe or side, although untidy footgear is doubtless some indication of carelessness. See that you have a comfortable shoe, keep it tidy, and bad luck will never bother you.
