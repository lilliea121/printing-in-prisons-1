$100,000 GIFT TO K. OF C. BY ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION

One of the firstofficial acts of the Rockefeller Foundation for 1918 was the appropriation of $100,000 to the Knights of Columbus war fund. This gift is said to have been prompted by the excellent showing made by the members of the organization in their work for the social and religious welfare of the U. 8. soldiers. 

As stated by a leading member of that organization recently, their work is for all soldiers and sailors, irrespective of creed, and that the society under whose auspices it is being conducted is adhering rigidly to the policy adopted by them from the very begining of doing this work in so broad a way that every man in uniform may profit by it.
