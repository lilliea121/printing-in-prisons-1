WHAT DO YOU THINK?

We would respectfully suggest to the Warden, and the powers that be, that a Service Flag would present a very fine appearance; say, at the entrance to the Main Building, or hanging on the Center.

Other Institutions of like character to this, have so honored their ‘‘ex-grads’’—and in so doing, did themselves honer—and no one knows better than Warden McKenty how many of his "old boys’’ are doing their “bit’’ Over There, or getting ready to go over.
