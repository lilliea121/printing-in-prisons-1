AMERICANS ALL! 

We may not stand in the battle-line, 
That holds Picardy’s plain; 
We may not man the grim, grey ships,
That guard the long sea lane: 
But we are doing that we can, 
To make the Hun threat vain. 

We may not take their vacant place, 
Who fight against the Hun: 
Take up in mill, and farm, and mine, 
The task they leave undone; 
But we have given that we could: 
Our dollars hardly won. 

We may not give the gift supreme, 
That others give to-day; 
And know that by our heart’s-blood shed, 
We’ve washed all stain away: 
By meager wage of scant toil given, 
Our little part we play. 

We may not do the thing we would: 
Fight in the battle van; 
Or train the guns that ‘‘Over There,"
Guard yet our own Home-land. 
We may not do the thing we would, 
So do we what we can.
