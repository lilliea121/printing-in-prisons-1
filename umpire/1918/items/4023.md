A MUSICAL “NOTE”

A re-organization of the E.S. P. Band was effected last week; and it’s Officers are now, B 8361, President; B 7621, Vice-President, and Conductor; B 7018, Secretary and B 6450, Treasurer.

Some new music has been purchased, and more is to come, the instruments have been furbished up, the members are practising deep breathing nightly, and whether all this portends more, or better music, we don’t pretend to know.
