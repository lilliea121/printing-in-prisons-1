IT ALL DEPENDS

When the years of Time are ended and the law is satisfied,
And you turn your face and footsteps to the practical outside,
Can you say you’ve learned the lesson that the silence tried to teach?
If you can, you’ll be a winner, yes, indeed, you’ll be a peach. 
When you’ve shaken these environs and are numbered with the free,
And you face the rocky-going in the land of liberty,
Wil  you clear the decks for action with a vow to battle square? 
If you do you’ll be a wonder, honest son you’ll be a bear.
Will you meet Old Opportunity with keen, appraising glance?
Will you think of ways to hustle when you have another chance?
Will you start upon the level with the horny- handed herd?
If you do, you’ll be amarvel say, you’ll surely be a bird!
When the portals close behind you and you run to catch a car,
Will you scoot across the river to a gilded palace bar?
Will you count on dodging labor and imagine life a dream? 
If you do—you’ll keep existing, never be a scream.  
When you start to land a ‘‘toe-holt’’ on the ladder of success;
Never think of quitting, kiddo-if you’re beaten don’t confess.
If you can’tdo any better you, at least, will be no slob-
If you stick with that position your employer calls a job.
