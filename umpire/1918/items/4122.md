A SOLDIER

Dear God, I raised my boy to be a soldier; 
I tried to make him strong of will and true; 
I told him many a tale of deeds heroic. 
The noblest and the sweetest tales I knew.

In thought, he shared the charge at Balaclava; 
With the Swiss Guard o‘ermastered coward Death; 
With Gordon all renounced; with Scott and Peary 
Breathed in his ardent youth heroic breath.

A little lad, he wept for wounded Sidney, 
For Bayard, sans reproche, who knew no fears, 
Yet, hurt himself, if one but said-‘‘My Soldier!‘‘
Straightway he smiled and swallowed down his tears.

I taught him that the brave are full of mercy : 
That gentleness and love to strength belong; 
That honor is the only high adventure, 
And goodness the one everlasting song!

And so I raised my boy to be’a soldier; 
A patriot soldier, brave, devoted, free! 
And now, and now-with grateful trust, O Father! 
I give him to my country and to thee!
