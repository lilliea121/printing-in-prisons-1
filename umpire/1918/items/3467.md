A FAMOUS STORY

“Literature for the sake of literature’’ stands a parlous chance for a hearing in these stirring days. Notwithstanding this fact, an Italian translation of Edward Everett Hale’s famous American short story. ‘‘The Man Without a Country,’’ has been presented to every soldier fighting on the Italian front.

Presumably because there is no bit of writing better calculated to rouse real patriotism and further heroic self-sacrifice than this sublime old story, which reads like a fireside anecdote, as though Hale were perfectly unconscious than he was telling a tale universal in its appeal and significance. Did he really ever dream that it would become an inspiring school classic? The blessing of having a country that needs them and wants them has always been taken for granted by Americans.

And now Edward Everett Hale’s undying voice is heard in the trenches of far-off Italy, telling the warriors of the Venetian plains that it is a very real blessing, even in war time!
