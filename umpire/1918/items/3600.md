STRICKLY ORIGINAL

While doing time, right here in the pen,
Without a relation and without a friend;
My thoughts went back to a wasted life,
And a girl I loved, who was once my wife. 

As I sit in my cell from day to day,
And listen to talk other fellow’s say; 
And see what a fool I have been,
I shudder to think of it, here in the pen. 

So I’ve started studying day by day,
And look in the future, far, far away, 
And there I can see success and fame, 
For which I am striving, striving to gain. 

Gaining in wisdom, and gaining in fame,
I can leave behind me a blemished name; 
And starting out in life anew
Be upright and loyal, honest and true.

—B 8545.
