HEART KEPT BUSY

Your heart is a very busy organ. While you breathe once, it beats four times, says Popular Science Monthly. At each beat it sends four pounds of blood through your veins and arteries. The weight of the circulating blood is 29 pounds. When you run, your legs and the other parts of your body need more blood, so your heart must pump faster.
