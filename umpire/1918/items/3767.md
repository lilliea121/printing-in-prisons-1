HELP WANTED

It is the wish of Ye Editor, that THE UMPIRE should have something more of a local flavor; and perhaps gain in interest, if not in circulation, thereby. To that end we would ask that anyone in possession of a really juicy bit of news, to whisper the same to us in strictest confidence, and so get a free subscription. Nothing is barred but scandal.
