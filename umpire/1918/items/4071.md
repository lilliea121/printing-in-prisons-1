Philadelphia, Pa.
August 1, 1918. 

My dear Warden:—

I enclose you a letter which I have just received in response to sending some of the Go-bang games to the Reeconstruction Department of the Surgeon General’s Hospital at Washington. It contains a deserved message of appreciation to our men which I shall be obliged if you will communicate to them.

Very sincerely yours, CHARLES CARVER

To, Mr. RoBERT J. MCKENTY, Warden.

War Department
Office of the Surgeon General
Washington

July 22, 1918.

My dear Mr. Carver:—

The games came yesterday and I gave them to two of our patients who were as interested in knowing by whom they were made as by the games themselves.

It is quite touching. I think the efforts of your inmates, and will you tell them please how much their efforts are appreciated by a lot of tired, homesick men.

Thanking you for your kindness, 
I am, Sincerely yours, 
MARGUERITE SANDERSON.
