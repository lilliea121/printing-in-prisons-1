SEEKS AMERICAN FARM LABOR

A correspondent writes that Canada, through her official channels, has been making a secret effort to induce American farmlabor to leave the western farms and accept employment in the western provinces of the Dominion, says the Evening Post in the course of an article this afternoon in which official documents are reproduced to substantiate the charge.

The proposal of the Canadian Government is contained in a confidential circular issued from the office of the chief censor at Ottawa on Januery 19, and Canadian editors are urged to keep the campaign for farm help at the expense of the States a secret.
