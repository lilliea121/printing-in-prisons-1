You must admit that "Wingie’’ is some Instructor, to take an awkward squad of new recruits, and in a few days whip them inte such shape as to carry off second honors in a competition. The rest of the Captains are still wondering how. he did it, and hinting at intimidation, but could a guy with but one wing intimidate six husky Judges? if he could he deserves more than a cigar, he deserves a Pardon.
