COULD LIVE ON BANANAS ALONE

The delicious banana is essentially sanitary—no germs can touch it. Like the apple, it can be served raw or cooked to please the most capricious palate. Like the onion, it provides the highly necessary mineral salts. Andlike meat and milk it has a high fuel value —slightly less than the one, slightly more than the other. Man cannot live by bread alone, but he could by bananas alone—if he had to.
