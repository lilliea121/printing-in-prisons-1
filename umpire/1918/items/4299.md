"CAPTAIN" SOUDER.

Though he is our Deputy Warden today and might be the "Boss" himself tomorrow, he is and would always remain to most of us but "Captain" Souder, and it is doubtful if any office bestowed upon him would separate the bond of Friendship and good-will that has sprung up between him and the prisoners in here.

When Captain Souder makes his rounds of the yard, the boys need not run -for cover; their is no camougflaging necessary; no hid- ing behind piles of rock or coal; nor stooping to a lie in order to explain one's presence in the open air. He is no respecter of persons, he has the same friendly wave of the hand, the same pleasant smile and his "How do you do?" to everyone, and the boys, instead of fearing him, line up along his path to get a bit of the cheer he gives, and thus he passes on, well met by all, looking for no trouble, unwilling to cause any, and returns to the Centre with bo less dignity. but with the feeling in his " heart that he is well liked, and that he has brightened the day for someone.-
