WOMEN TO DO FARM WORK

It is announced that plans are being definitely formulated to place women for farm work and to organize a Uuit System for their maintenance while at work.

It is urgently requested that patriotic land owners who have facilities for housing such groups of women (there will be about 20 to 30 women in a Unit) and who are desirous of helping this movement to increase food production, communicate with the land Service Department, Woman's Committee, Council of National Defense, 1607 Walnut street, as soon as possible.

It should be understood that all land and housing facilities offered must be rent free as the agencies at work on this plan have not large enough funds to pay rent.
