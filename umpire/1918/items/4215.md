PAY PRISONERS IN NEW JERSEY

Pending the adoption of permanent rules andregulations governing the employment of inmatesof the New Jersey State Prison onroad work, the Dapartment of Charities and Cor- rections has promulgated temporary sched- ules for wage payments and parole merits.

Under this schedule chauffeurs, machine men and mechanics will receive thirty cents a day for their work and laborers fifteen or twenty-five cents, according to their ratings. All wage payments exceeding twenty-five cents a day will be made only upon approva1 of the principal keeper.

The board requires that inmates for road work must be carefully selected from Grade A at the prison, aceording to mental and physical conditions, record and conduct while in theinstitution. Itis planned to make road camp assignment a reward and to establish it asapre-parole condition. A dailyrecord must be kept of the effort, performance and con- duct of each inmate, and promotion in grade will be made only upon such record.

Deductions from mimimum and maximum terms of sentences, as provided by the act of this year will be based upon the actual con- duct, effort and performance ratings estab- lished by the board.
