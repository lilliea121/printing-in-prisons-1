FROM OVER THERE

We are indebtedmourtesy of Capt. Parker for "leave to print’’ the letter re- produced below, being from an ex-member of the Institutional staff who is now doing his “bit’’ in France.

France,July 28, 1918

Captain Parker:

Dear Sir

Just a few lines to let you know that I am thinking of you all, but somehow never get a chance to write. I got hurt last Monday a week ago, by shrapnel on my head and face, and also a hole in the side of my leg, but my face and head is all right again, and my leg is healing fine. I think I will be up and around soon again.

I am now in the First American Base Hospitalfin the —— ——, that’s a regular sporting town. They have a very large park, and have hot springs, and baths, and the boy’s tell me it is great to bathe. I was trying to locate Frank Tucker, but somehow I can never get to meet him. Will close my letter for this time, hoping these few lines find you in the best of health. Remind me to all the boys.

Yours Respectfully,

John A. Heck
