MANNERS AND THE LAUGH

Speaking about the value of a hearty laugh as a stimulant to the mind, a prominent doctor avers that ‘‘a good laugh and a happy smile are necessary for men and women in every activity, though there are and always have been some stiffnecked people who doubt the benefit and propriety of a hearty laugh. We have all heard women of the old school of manners admit reluctantly that they "had to laugh’’ at a play they went to see, as if there were something too crude for well-bred folk in a hearty laugh, and if you could but face the audience instead of the stage during the performance of a taking comedy you wculd see here and there prim, proper folk pulling their faces straight the moment the curtain goes down and the lights go up for fear some one might think they had so far forgotten their manners as to share in the general laughter.
