TO OUR BAND

The Band is playing over there; My thoughts are far away,
Changing with the changing air, Whether sad, or gay:
On viewless wings of Music borne, My willing spirit goes;
Peg o’ my Heart is waiting,
Where the River Shannon flows. 

Hark! How the cymbals clash in glee, 
The Music’s gay, and sweet;
It’s Blossom Time in Tennessee; 
Where we were wont to meet:
The Eyes of the World are the Eyes of You, 
The music doth proclaim,
— Will the Girl I Left Behind be true, 
Till I come back again—.

The drum-beat echoes in my heart; 
“My Country, 'Tis of Thee!”
It bids me play the manly part, 
Here, or beyond the sea. 
And now in loud insistent strain, 
The horns are calling to 
Where they’re fighting, and they’re dying, 
For the Red, White, and Blue!
