A GOLDEN RULE 

When I find myself sitting in judgment 
On the faults of a brother man 
When I’m tempted to censure his follies, 
And harshly his conduct to scan; 
When I tell him, “You should do that way,” 
And morally certain ‘tis true: 
I remember how many do likewise. 
And cry to myself, “Now do you?’’

If I notice my friend getting reckless 
And making too free with his cash: 
If another appears rather heady 
And a little inclined to be rashed; 
If one wastes and one hoards and one borrows 
In a manner I think they must rue; 
I am somewhat disposed to excuse them 
When I say to myself, ‘‘Haven’t you?” 

Is a neighbor exacting and selfish? 
Is he haughty, disdaining, ‘‘the mob?”
Is he a meddlesome, clumsy, intrusive, 
Or a bigot, a pendant, or snob? 
Is he shallow, unsteady, or stupid? 
And I find myself taking that view: 
I revert to the sins that beset me, 
And say to myself, “Are not you?”
