A CREED 

I would be true, for there are those who trust me; 
I would be pure, for there are those who care: 
I would be strong, for there are those who suffer;
I would be brave, dare;
I would be friend to all—the foe— the friendless;
I would be giving, and forget the gift;
I would be humble, for I know my weakness;
I would look up, and laugh, and love, and lift.
