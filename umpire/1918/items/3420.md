THE SOLDIER’S CANE

It is one of the regulations of the British army that every soldier when walking out must carry in his hand a stick in order to preserve a soldierly appearance and prevent anything like slouching in his gait.

This rule applies to all ranks, and should any one seek to evade it he would find his progress barred by the sentry at the barrack gate or entrance to camp.

Privates generally carry light canes or ‘‘swagger sticks,” noncommissioned officers fairly stout sticks and officers invariably go in for the more expensive kind.

It is a question that has often been asked, Who first suggested the idea? But nobody seems to know, says the “Dundee Advertiser.” From the earliest times drill sergeants and drum majors have carried sticks, and the fashion may come from that fact.
