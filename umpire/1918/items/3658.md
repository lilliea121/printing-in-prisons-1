VERMOUNT STARTLED BY “COLORED STORM”

It is reported from Bellows Falls, Vt., that a severe hunderstorm occurred at that place on Saturday, and was accompanied by dark clouds, vivid lightning and red and yellow hail. Red hail is seen on the white snow everywhere today and the contrastis marked.

Older residents tell of hearing about blood snow more than 100 years ago, butlast night’s precipitation is the first seen by the present generation. Old residents believe it foreshadows the shedding of much blood in the near future in the European war.

An authority states that when ponds that hold water are dried up during a short season of each year numerous specimens of fungi are carried from the basins in microscopic form by the wind into the atmosphere.

Some of these organisms contain red oxide of iron, giving a reddish tint to the snow which carried it down to earth again. Blood snow, however, is unusual in North America.

It is observed principally over the area lying east, west and north of the Sahara and sometimes in the Arctic.
