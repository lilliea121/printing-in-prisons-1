THE SLACKER

The slacker, to our mind is the man who says, ‘‘Let George do it;” whether the job’s making the world safe for the Democrats, or building a fire in the kitchen stove; and we are very heartily in favor of having this breed of person very harshly spoken to. We don’t like to think that we may have such animalcules among our number; men who would refuse the opportunity of service were it given them, but there are little straws that point that way, and we blush for very shame. The type of man who says ‘‘Why should I do anything for the country? What did it ever do for me?’’ is not destined to be very popular in here, and the sooner they awake to this fact the better. Certainly not! The country couldn’t do anything for them; nobody could, except possibly the Fool- Killer, and he is to busy with large game in these days, to bother with such small fry.
