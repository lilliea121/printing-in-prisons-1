LITTLE TOWNS AHEAD OF PHILA.

The small towns throughout the State are far ahead of Philadelphia when it comes to the good old-fashioned spirit of patriotism, said Hector McQuarrie last night at the twenty-fifth anniversary dinner of the Philadelphia Lehigh Club in Kugler’s restaurant.

McQuarrie, a lieutenant in the Canadian army, is now a member of the National Bureau, tcuring the country to assist in counteracting German propaganda.

“Why the enthusiasm you find in all those little towns,” he continued, ‘‘is simply wonderful. It must be that those people still feel the spirit of Valley Forge. In England itself you cannot find the same war enthusiasm.”

Lieutenant Henri Marquisan, of the French Aviation, made one of the finest addresses he has delivered in the United States. He said America already had more than repaid the debt she owed to France.
