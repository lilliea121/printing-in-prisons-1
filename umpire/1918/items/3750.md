AVIATORS STUDY BIRDS

Despite the strenuous and engrossing character of their occupation, a few aviators have found opportunity to note the height of flight of various migrating birds. Thus from French soldiers of the air, it is learned that swallows have been observed to maintain an average altitude of 700 yards and wild ducks one of 1,800 yards, while green plover have been seen at a height of 2,150 yards. Incidentally it may be mentioned that the ducks were moving at a speed of sixty-five and a half miles an hour when flying upward and sixty-nine miles an hour when flying horizontally. From another aviator it is learned that when he was flying at 9,500 feet he saw swallows high above him. And another, whose observations were made at a height of 6,000 feet during a heavy bombardment, with anti-aircraft shells bursting in all directions, states that he observed 200 golden plover, perhaps driven higher than usual by the fact that the vicinity was ‘‘an unpleasant belt to cross.”
