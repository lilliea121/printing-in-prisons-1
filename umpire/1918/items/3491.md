THE CLARION CALL

Ye have heard his splendid slogan. Are ye strengthening thy soul
For the struggle and the sorrow, and the thunder clouds that roll
O’er the valley of thy pleasures and the hill-tops of thy hopes,
And the mountains where ye dreamed of joy above wild, wooded slopes?

Will ye heed thy leader’s clarion call and let thy visions go,
While ye gird thy loins for battle and thy arm to strike a blow?
Will ye face the truth and do the deed and go where heroes lie
’Neath the snows that fall in Flanders? for ye those heroes die.

'Tis for ye our prophet speaks his word and bids the world awake
To the wonder of the war we wage the soul of man at stake.
Why tarry ye my brothers? Ye should hasten to the gate,
Where the legions of the Lord of Hosts thy speedy coming wait.

They have fought for ye and died for ye who are not of thy blood;
They had stood, a dike in danger, that has saved ye from the flood.
Awake! Awake, my brothers! tain’s cry be heard!
He’d save thy soul alive for thee! Arise and heed his word!

—Edward S. Van Zile.
