TOO MUCH TALK

The great trouble with many of us these days is, that we talk too much and do too little. Evidently the writer of the subjoining article was of that opinion when he wrote as follows:

“The market value of mere talk goes down and down. We have with us this morning, this evening and all the time of day between, the man who talks tco much with his mouth. The quiet fellow who does the work, but can’t express himself as well as he delivers the goods, shows up at an uncomfortable disadvantage while the talk is on; but not beforehand nor afterward. He bides his time and has his innings.

“Who has not listened to the stream of talk gushing like an oil well from the lower part of the face of some interminable lo- quacity and wondered how it is done? One speaker in Congress who was trying to hold up the Panama route for the interoceanic canal uttered 1,163,000 words against it, all in vain. Assuredly he could have said a million words fewer and there would have been no great bereavement among our citizens.

“We are all of us very much obliged to the fellow who 'stands up, speaks up and shuts up.' The terrible feature of a committee meeting is the man who must have his say. As he begins to develop his own idea it carries him away, and he goes on and on with it. He exhausts the subject and those present. But another man brings the whole of the deliberation to a focus in a few sentences and makes the long palaver seem superfluous. When Washington presided over the sessions that gave us the Constitution he spoke once. The chairman of such a convention nowadays would have been interrupting, rebuking, commenting continually, just so as to break into print, and to let the whole country know that he was it.

“A few words from a man of action count for more than a long harangue from a wind-bag. When a big man talks it is his personality that speaks and not simply his tongue. His autobiography of achievement is back of him. His struggle upward all the way to the place where he now stands is his best eloquence, his convincing logic. The immediate honors of the occasion may be carried off by some suave and debonair gentleman whose mellifluous tongue sets the king’s English to music. But.as the meetiug breaks up, what the people go away with is not the address of the polished rhetorician but the message of the simple, homely soul who all his days has been living the truth that he now brings to utterance.

‘‘The character qualifies the pulpiteering. What you say counts or is discounted by virtue or default of the man you are. The public mistrusts a man who publishes his devotion to it and in private relations is a curmudgeon.

“There is no need for him whose fund of small talk is meagre to grieve. His assets in valuable deeds may far outweigh the windy wordiness of one who has the social genius that shines at passing the tea and toast and admiring the poodle.

"I have always been afraid of the quiet man,’ said the President at West Point. Still waters of character run deep. Action comes first, and speech is a secondary issue. Talking did not come to earth till Adam and his wife appeared, when everything was done.’ ’’
