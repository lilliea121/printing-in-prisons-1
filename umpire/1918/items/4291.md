We are going to suspend both comment and judgement upon the passing of Mr. Stackhouse from the Kitchen purlieus, until we have studied the subsequent menu for a period. The Sunday pot-pie bore no evidence of change in either make-up, or furnishing, and we feel reasonably safe in saying "Bon voyage" to the departing officer. Mr. Willoughby will succeed, and we are all agog with anticipation.
