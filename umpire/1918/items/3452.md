NOTICE

The H. F. Club would appreciate very much if each and everv member would save all old Newspapers and Magazines as well as all scrap-paper of everv description. Give it to your Delegate. The paper is sold and the money goes to the Club—you and yours will receive some benefit from this source. Don’t waste any, save it all, every little helps.
