I am sure the thanks of the members of the H. F. Club, are due B 8361 for his thoughtful and generous gift of an inlaid jewelry cabinet to Mr. John Helmus of Washington, D.C. as a token of our deep respect for his kindly interest in our club by giving us the privilege of enjoying the justly celebrated French War pictures, last Saturday afternoon which we all fully appreciated. â€”B 8501, 6 B.
