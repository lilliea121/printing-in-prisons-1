HOW TO BE A THOROUGHBRED

I believe in work. For discontent and labor are not often companions.

I believe in leisure and in play. For neither mental nor physical development is possible without them.

I believe in thrift. For to store up a little regularly is to store up character as well.

I believe in simple living. For simplicity means health and health means happiness.

I believe in loyalty. For if I am not true to others I cannot be true to myself.

I believe in a cheerful countenance. For a sour face is the sign of a grouch.

I believe in holding up my chin. For self-respect commands respect from others.

I believe in keeping up my courage. For troubles flee before a brave front.

I believe in bracing up my brother. For an encouraging word may save the day for him.

I believe in living up to the best that is in me. For to lower the standard is to give up the fight.

These beliefs I shall keep always with me, and I shall strive to live up to them. For to do so is to be a thoroughbred.
