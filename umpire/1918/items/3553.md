DEATH OF SPANISH WAR HERO

A New York correspondent writes that Daniel Delehanty, seventy-two years old, who contracted Brightâ€™s disease during ninety-six hours exposure on the bridge of the United States ship Suwanee while he was in command of the vessel off Santiago during the Spanish- American war, died Monday at his home in Pelham, N. Y., as a result, physicians said, of this ailment. For four days and four nights Captain Delehanty since retired from the navy, was compelled to remain on duty without relief or sleep.
