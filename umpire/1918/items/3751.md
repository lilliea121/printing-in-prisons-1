EATING A DURIAN

On my second day’s stay in Malaysia my appetite was nearly spoiled by an attempt to eat a durian, says a writer. Eating a durian, or, as in my case, essaying to do so, is an experience not soon lost to memory. Its achievement must be productive of a noticeable growth of ego. I often think how I should enjoy being able casually to boast, “I have eaten durians in the east," or "this tastes as good as a durian.” The durian has a powerful personality. It is large and green, not unlike a breadfruit, and it is covered with unpleasant spikes. But these, I am told, are no deterrent to the man or beast who has once acquired the durian habit —who, by complete suppression or mortification of the organs of smell, has suceeded in swallowing even a section of the fruit. It grows on tall trees, and natives sit for days waiting for a ripening durian to drop. White children, once immune, prefer it to all other fruit; tigers will appoach close to Malay villages, risking their lives to vary their carnivorous diet with a mouthful of durian.
