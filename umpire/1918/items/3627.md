INDUSTRY OF THE INDIANS

The Indians are rapidly undertaking all the duties of American citizens, justifying the policy of treating them as competent to manage their own affairs which the Government now pursues. In the last six years they have almost doubled their acreage of cultivated land, have multiplied two and a half times the value of their crops, and five times the value of their live stock sold. The food production campaign this year has increased from 25 to 50 per cent., the cultivated acreage of their lands, of which 40,060 to 56,900 additional acres will be placed under leasehold cultivation next year. Indians subscriked $4,707,850 in Liberty Bonds and a thousand students and ex-students of Indian schools enlisted as volunteers. The time is past when the Indian can appropriately be called “Poor Lo.”
