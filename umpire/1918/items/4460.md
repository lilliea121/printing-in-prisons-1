THE PRISON LAWYER The prison-lawyer is as much in evidence in penal institutions to-day, as the sea-lawyer was in the merchant marine fifty years ago. While the latter spouted maritime law in an endless stream to his eager listeners, the former zealously inflicts his knowledge, or rather lack of knowledge upon his credulous companions in the Jails. The prison-lawyer is rampant within these walls, as he is within the walls of all similar institutions. If you care to listen to him and then forget all he says, it may at least afford you entertainment for a while, but if you take him seriously, it is sure to be at the cost of your peace of mind, therefore, don't do it. The prison-lawyer does not _ cite authorities when rendering opinions, â€˜but instead, calls to mind cases in which he has often figured as a principal, or the cases of others whom he may have known, or yet others who were known to someone he knew, and so on. As a hanger-on of criminal trials, and an omnivorous reader of criminal news, coupled with a retentive memory, he has acquired a vocabulary of high-sounding legal terms which he uses convincingly in explaining any point of law which may arise. Within the short space of five minutes he can hear and pass judgment on a case which would require the Supreme Court Justices many weary Months of research, for no question of law is too intricate for the prison lawyer.
