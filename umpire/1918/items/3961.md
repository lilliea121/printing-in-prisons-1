WEDNESDAY P. M. BIBLE SCHOOL

The meeting of Chaplain Jos. Welch’s Bible School held on Wednesday afternocn June 19 was without doubt one of the best meetings yet held by this class, a remarkably large attendence and pleasant weather seemed to enthuse those who had charge. Mr. Frank Dipple was in his usual good spirits and after a brief address, lead the class in the reading of the day’s lesson ‘‘Jesus on the Cross” Mark I5 - 22 to 39. Mr. George Sanville was again with us and conducted an elegant song service. Chaplain Weleh led the boys in the recitation of The Lords Prayer in unison, and also made a brief address

The speaker for the afternoon was William Barnes Lower D. D. minister of Holy Trinity Presbyterian Church, of this city. Rev. Lower is a man who has traveled extensively through all quarters of the civilized world and certainly proved his ability asan orator. No man with any feeling could fail to be imbressed by the plea he made to the boys to lead good clean lives.
