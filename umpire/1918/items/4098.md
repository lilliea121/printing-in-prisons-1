SEARCHING THE BIBLE

Texts from the inexhaustable mine of truth remind us of these singular formations which often occur in rocks, called Drasic Cavities. You pick up a rough, ordinary-looking stone of somewhat round shape; there is nothing specially attractive or interesting about it. You split it open with a hammer, and what a marvelous sight is displayed! The common place boulder is a hollow sphere, lined with the most beautiful crystals, amethysts purple with a dawn that never was on land or sea. 

â€”HUGH McMILLAN
