RELICS A THOUSAND YEARS OLD

After three months of archaeological ex- plorations in New Mexico, recently, Prof. T. W. Hodge announces that his expedition had un- earthed the relics of an Indian civilization probably 1,000 years old. These evidences consisting largely of glass beads, pendants and ornamental combs encrusted with torquoise, were unearthed in Central New Mexico, fifteen miles southwest of Zuni and about three miles from the Arizona border.

By digging far enough into the debris on the site of the ancient village of Hawikoh, Dr. Hodge unearthed the burial grounds of the ancient Zuni Indians at different levels. At the lowest level the methods of burial indicated an extremely remote period of Zuni The bodies, in conformance with some custom, were apparently dismembered, the heads and limbs being buried in one spot and the trunks in another. Ancther class of burials was discovered apparently of another period, when the remains were cremated in bowls, and vessels containing water and food were deposited with the dead.
