LIBRARY NOTICE

As the number of men with ‘‘special privileges’’ to help themselves to books in the library have grown to such proportion that they have become quite an encumbrance to the smooth running of the department, notice is hereby given; that all such existing privileges are to-day cancelled, and will, in the future, not be granted to anyone except Overseers and those with a written permit from the Warden or the Chaplain.

The formerly privileged men who have their slates on file in the library can have these returned to them by notifying the library runner or calling for them in person. Books on special study can be obtained at any time through the School Teacher, Mr. Bonsall. 

Abel Schall Jr. 
Librarian
