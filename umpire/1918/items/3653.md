THE LARGEST WOODEN STEAMSHIP LAUNCHED

From Orange, Tex., it is reported that without the usual ceremony that usually attends such incidents, the largest wooden steamship ever built was launched on the Sabine Riverâ€”just five months after its keel was laid. The steamship was built for the Cunard Steamship Company, of Liverpool, and designed by A. A. Daugharty, formerly of New York. Its dimensions are: Length 330 feet; beam, 48 feet; molded depth, 27 feet. It will have a carrying capacity of 4700 tons and will be equipped with triple expansion engines of 1450 horsepower. It contains more than two and a half million feet of lumber. Its propeller blades are more than fifteen feet in length and two and a half feet wide.

The ship was built by the National Shipbuilding Corporaticn, and there are now six vessels of similar type under construction.
