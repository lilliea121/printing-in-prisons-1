HONOR AND FRIENDSHIP CLUB 
The Kiddies Christmas Fund

For the information of those who are not familiar with the time honored custom of the H. F. C., it might be well to give some of the details and purposes of this Fund. The Officers of the Club call upon all members who can afford to do so to contribute what they can, any amount being acceptable from 5 cents to $ 1.00. The purpose is to see that the children of our less fortunate fellows do not suffer for the very necessities of life, while their natural bread winner is lost to them; that they are provided with warm clothing for the winter; and that some specific brightness is brought into their lives on that Day of Days when it is the childâ€™s inalienable right to be happy.

More particularly this year when hardships are greater than usual and bare necessities are more scant your aid is needed, and it is thought wise to devote the use of the fund more particularly to articles of distinctively useful nature.

It is pleasing to be able to state that a sum exceeding$100.00 remains from last year, and as this fund may be used for no other purpose than for the kiddies, this will be added to the contributions of this year, when, as no man needs to be told, bareliving is a hardship.

The first contribution will be asked on September 16 th, when the customary coupons will be giving out. Do your level best, men, when the appeal is made, for though youhave many other calls, think of each little one, who might not otherwise be able to have any joy at Christmas, with a smile upon his or her face, brought there through the means you have assisted in providing.
