THAT TO-MORROW HABIT

We have it: probably you have it. The Government has it when it comes to letting us in on this world serap. Itis perhaps the most common, and the most sneakingly soul- destroying of all vices. We coyly confess to an ability-garnered we know not where-to do things along our particular line of endeavor, but we enjoy a perfectly wonderful faculty for putting a task off until the morrow, and nine times out of ten the morrow never comes for us, and ‘‘bang’’ goes anotheropportunity whereby we might have become, if not rieh, at least famous. We appeal to our readers to advise us of a cure forthisterribledisease which is blighting more lives, including ovur own, than cancer, and we feel perfectly safe in assuring the luckyv discoverer of a prever- tive, or curative agent which is not too nasty to take that riches will be his, and that his name will go ringing down the ages lirked with Dr. Javnes, and Lyvdia Pinkbams, ete, give us something that willmake usappreoach our work with something of the spirit of a Kansas cvclone crossed witha Missouri mule, and the giver can have the half of our Kingdom and no questions asked.
