Electrical "wizard", air, and hydraulic pressure experts, are requested to call upon Cap'n George Eels in his office in the Dove Block, at any time between 8 a.m. and 4.30 p.m. when they will hear of something to their advantage. Cap'n George is said to be contemplating the early installation of an electric "mother" for his feathered charges, which will be guaranteed to feed, wood, and water them with automatic precision at fifteen minute intervals, and help is urgently needed. He has suffered from the well-meant efforts of a lot of "amateur" talent, and is reported to be disgusted with the lot, and will pay high wages to really competent workmen.
