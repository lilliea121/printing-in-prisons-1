AN ELEPHANT’S STUBBORNNESS

The elephant, Luna, was not pleased with the disposition ironworkers made of some huge iron girders which they piled up between two fences surrounding the elephant yards at the New York zoological gardens.

She managed to roll them under the corral fence and dragged them one by one into fhe elephant house for better keeping. The girders weigh 500 pounds each and on bringing one in she proudly threw it down on the cement floor with a tremendous crash. The keepers tried to get Luna to take the heavy girders back. She refused to do so flatly and in plain elephant language told them if they wanted them back they might take them back themselves, and this they had to do.

Animals ‘‘get their minds sot’’ just the same as humans, as any man who handles live stock can tell you, and they can be just as unreasonable.
