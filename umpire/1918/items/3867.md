SEE HOOVER

On bended knee, the housewife begs;
"I pray you, but one dozen eggs!”
The grocer’s cheeks with tears are wet,
His voice is wild with all regret;
“I’ve sold you two, if more you’d get, See Hoover!”

‘‘See you this gold? These yellow-backs?
O Mr. Butcher, take your axe,
And cut me but one T-bone steak!’’
Scarce could the butcher reply make;
“You’ve had your share, if more you’d take, 
See Hoover!”

“A dozen rolls, in charity!
An old friend’s dropping into tea;
Or give me but one loaf of bread.’’
The baker sadly shakes his head,
“You’ve had your loaf, for more,’’ he said, 
‘‘See Hoover!”

“Here, bar-keep’, set ’em up again!’’
And down he slaps another ‘‘ten;”
A tear is in the bar-keep’s eye,
In accents sad he makes reply;
“You’ve had one drink, if more you’d buy, 
See Hoover!’’

“Waiter, another helping, please, 
And bring me just a bit of cheese,’’ 
The waiter cries, ‘‘Alas! M’sieu’, 
Your card’s been punched. What can I do? 
If you would eat a meal for two, 
See Hoover!”
