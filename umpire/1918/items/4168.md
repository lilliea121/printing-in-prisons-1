HERO DAY 
September 13, 1918. 
(To the memory of Pennsylvania’s dead)

O men of Pennsylvania, 
Who heard the drum’s behest; 
O lads of Pennsylvania, 
Our bravest, and our best; 
Who lifted up a knightly lance, 
And died to stay the Hun’s advance; 
And sleep in flow’ry fields of France, 
So gloriously ‘‘Gone West.”

O men of Pennsylvania, 
We honor being dead; 
O lads of Pennsylvania, 
For whom our tears are shed; 
Rest ye, abiding guests of Fame; 
We shall take up your task amain, 
And none shall say ye died in vain, 
Your blood was useless shed.

O men of Pennsylvania, 
Who being dead, live on; 
O lads of Pennsylvania, 
Who knew but manhood’s dawn; 
Mother, or wife, or maid may weep, 
For that a tryst you wili not keep; 
But ye have honor, and ye sleep: 
What, and ye had not gone?
