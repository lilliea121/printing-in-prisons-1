HOME RUNS

Mrs. Laura T. Boal, one of the Matrons, who so efficiently directs the 2nd Block, left for a month’s vacation on the 16th. She will spend the time with her mother, near Trevose, Bucks County, and her charges are looking hopefully to her return with garden “sass,”’and other creature comforts of the country.

Mr. Peter Enckler, our late Deputy-Warden, paid the Institution a visit on Wednesday last, and viewed the well-remembered scenes of his past labors, with—we fear—regret, for ‘‘Pete’’ was one who loved the ‘‘harness.’’

Mr. Gillespie, and his workmen, have been exceedingly busy these past weeks, making improvements about the Institution; installing ventilators in the Hall, against the coming winter amusement season; renovating the Deputy’s residence, in anticiaption of Mr. Robert L. Myers, settling therein; and they are now at work on a ‘‘movie parlor’’ for the 2d Block. Let the good work go on.
