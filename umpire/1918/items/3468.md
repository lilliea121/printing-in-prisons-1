LEAVES CONVERTED INTO WOOD

Artifical wood from dried leaves—especially those of oak, beech or birch—is a new product, reported from Austria, using even cheaper waste material than the sawdust already similarly utilized. The leaves are finely ground, mixed with a suitable binder, shaped in molds under a pressure of 350 atmospheres, and dried by heat while still under pressure. The best binder is stated to be viscose, though this may be strengthened by addition of a little glue, water-glass, casein, rosin, or other substance. The ground leaves are boiled with soda lye before mixing with the solution of viscose;and the viscose may be prepared from a portion of the leaf powder by treating with sodalye and then with carbon disulphide.

Coloring matter may be added to the leaf powder or to the pasty mixture. Some filler may be desirable for special purposes, and the materials suitable include asbestos, infusorial earth, wood flour and peat flour,
