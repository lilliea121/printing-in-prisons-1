U. S. MARINE CORPS SEEKS 2,220 MORE MEN

A telegram was received by Captain S.A. W. Patterson, on Saturday, directing him to begin enlisting Philadelphia’s quota of 2,220 men wanted at once for the corps. Enlisting will begin at once. Along with the men wanted for sea military duty a call was made for fifty stationary engineers to work at League Island.

The inactivity in Marine Corps circles was caused by the delay on the part of Congress in passing the bill providing for the formation of a new division of the Marine Corps, calling for 20,000 more men. It is not thought here that today’s enlistment order will interfere with recruiting the 20,000 men specified in the bill now pending.

Captain Patterson said that the Marine Corps would accept married and single men between the ages of 18 and 33, that men in the dratt, providing they are not wanted to make up the next quota, will be enlisted. The requirements for this branch of the service are severe.
