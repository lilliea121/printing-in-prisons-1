LANTERNS LIGHT BROADWAY

The joker has come to the fore on Broadway, N. Y., as the result of the dimming of the white lights on that thoroughfare. Recently after the current had been turned off a man walked up the big street with alighted lantern. He wended his way across Broadway, and after swinging the lantern about his head much after the fashion of trainmen signaling, he continued up the street. He had sown seeds that began to sprout in many directions and a few minutes later rival humorists appeared with lanterns, electric flashlights, and one optimist tried to keep a candle going as he walked down toward Times Square.
