ONCE A CRIMINAL

According to the first annual report of the Ohio State Board of Clemency, there have been but 38 violators out of 745 men parocled from the Ohio penitentiary. The police and detective theory that ‘‘once a criminal always a criminal,’’ seems to be knocked into a cock- ed hat with good reports coming in frcm all states where the parole law is effective, which means that the average man will make good.
