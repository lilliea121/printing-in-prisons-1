ISLAND HIDDEN BY CLOUDS

White Island, 30 miles distant from New Zealand, is probably the most extraordinary island in the world. It is an enormous mass of rock nearly three miles in circumference rising 900 feet above the sea, and is perpetually enveloped in dark clouds, which are visible for nearly a hundred miles, says a writer.

This island consists almost entirely of sulphur, with a small percentage of gypsum. Some years ago an attempt was made to float a company to work the sulphur, which is of high quality; but, strange to say, sufficient capital was not subseribed. Therefore the export of sulphur from White Island is still very small.

In the interior is a lage fully fifty acres in extent, the vapor of which hasatemperature of 110 degrees F. and is strongly impregnated with acids. On one side of this lake are craters from which steam escapes with a great force and noise. This steam and the vapor form the dark cloud which envelopes the island.
