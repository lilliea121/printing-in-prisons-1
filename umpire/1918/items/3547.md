THE GREAT WALLS OF JERUSALEM

Selimâ€™s son, Suleiman the Magnificent, once built the great walls about Jerusalem.

These walls of Suleiman are the present; fortifications of the city. 

But the great walls of Suleiman the Magnificent are only the last of a long series of walls which, time after time, have been built only to be destroyed. The most tragical destruction not only of the walls, but also of the whole city, was that which was carried out by the Roman armies of Titus, in the year 70 of our era, in the reign of the Emperor Vespasian.
