NEW NEEDLE EASY TO THREAD

No matter how good your eyes are, there is always a certain amount of eye strain in threading a needle. If your vision is not as sharp as it once was, it is even something of a task to get a piece of thread through a needleâ€™s eye.

A needle has been devised which can be threaded by the simple expedient of looping the thread over the head of the needle and drawing it downward. The needle differs from the ordinary needle in that it has an opening through the top of the eye through which the thread slips when it is drawn downward. The steel ends spring close together as soon as the thread has passed into the eye. This type of needle said to be particularly adapted to the doing of fancy work because two or three threads may be passed through the eye at one time, a feat that is quite impossible with the ordinary needle. It is also useful for embroidering with worsted, the thick, clumsy threads of which make it necessary, usually, to employ a needle for the purpose which has a large, clumsy eye.
