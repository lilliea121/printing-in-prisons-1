THE LONELY FIGHT

It’s easy to be right when the multitude is cheering;
It is easy to have courage when you’re fighting with the throng 
But it’s altogether different when the multitude is sneering
To fight for what you know is right with no one else along.
It’s easy to be honest when the multitude is gazing;
It is easy to be truthful when the crowds are standing by;
But it’s altogether different when there is no spotlight blazing
To stand alone for what is right and never cheat or lie.
