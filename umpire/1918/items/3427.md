ALIENS ORDERED TO REGISTER

From local reports we gather the information that the registration of all German alien enemies in the United States will begin February 4 at 6 o’clock in the morning and con- tinue up to and including February 9 at 8 o’clock in the evening. Orders to this effect, signed by United States Attorney General Gregory, were received by United States Marshal Noon, who notified Postmaster Thornton.

The order requires all male Germans of the age of fourteen years or over to report to the nearest place of registration, which is the district police station in the case of cities of 5000 inhabitancs or over and the local postoffices in the case of cities or towns of fewer than 5000 inhabitants.

Registration stations are to be open from 6 A. M. until 8 . M., and the burden of having themselves properly registered is upon each individual subject to the order. The penalty for failure to comply with the order makes the recalcitrant liable to internment.

A copy of Attorney General Gregory’s order has been sent to Mayor Smith, who will issue instructions to the head of the city police department. The work is to be carried on under the supervision of the United States Marshal’s office.
