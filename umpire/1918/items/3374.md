MISSION SERVICES

Catholic mission services will be held at the prison Chapel from January 6 to 13 inclusive.

The services will be conducted by the Rev. P. J. Maguire, S. J., who met with such excellent success here last year.

All inmates who are interested will be welcome by members of the Church who will be in attendance during the week of the mission.
