VALE

With sincere regret we announce to our readers the passing of Mr. Peter Enckler, lately Deputy Warden of this Institution, whose death occurred at 1. p. m. Sunday Oct. 20th. The late Mr Enckler served the Institution in varied capacities for a period of some forty-three years, and filled the some-what difficult post of Deputy-Warden to the entire satisfaction of all concerned, since it's creation some half-score years ago.

He was a most able and efficient officer, and earned, and kept the sympathy and liking of all, whether officer, or inmate, with whom he came in contact, and he naturally leaves a wide circle of friends, both within, and without the Institution, to mourn his loss. We are sure we are voicing the sentiment of the entire inmate body in tendering the sincerest sympathy to his bereaved family. May he find that perfect rest and peace which is the best reward of those who have fought life's battles faithfully and well, have kept faith with their fellow men, helping many, and harming none, and of whom all men can truthfully say, he served others always, never himself.
