TALK LESS OF PRISON AFFAIRS

Among other good things in the January number of The Bulletin, we note the following article which we quote for the benefit of our readers.

“The Bulletin is printed for the men of San Quentin Prison and we will endeavor to print such matter as will advance and better the prisoners life. To that end, the least we say about prisons the better, for just as long as a man thinks of prison, writes of prison, talks of prison and reads of prison, just that much longer will it take the law of evolution and civilized envirenments to erase from his mind and actions the brand and habits of a prison experience.’’
