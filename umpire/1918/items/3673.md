WIRELESS FOR THE VATICAN

Ever since Italy entered the war, says a writer, the Pope and his entourage have befen working at a great disadvantage. For while the Vatican has maintained a strict neutrality, it has endeavored to maintain its usual relations with the Central Empires and the Entente countries, and this has. not always been simple because of its location In a belligerent nation. At present there is a movement on foot to install a powerful wireless union at the Vatican in order Catholic Church will be in a position to communicate directly with any of the countries at war, without subjecting the despatches to the censorship of the belligerent nations.
