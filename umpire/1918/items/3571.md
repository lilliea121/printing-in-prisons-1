WHY HE DID’NT GET A RAISE

He stopped growing.
He had no intiative.
He watched the clock.
His temper kept him back.
He felt above his position.
His tongue outlasted his brain.
He wasn’t ready for the next step.
He didn’t put his heart into his work.
He believed in living as he went along.
His familiarity with inferiority dulled his ideals.
He was always grumbling. He was always behindhand.
He was not dependable, one never knew where to find him.
He never dared to act on his own judgment, did not trust it.
He tried to substitute bluff for training preparation, expert knowledge.
He never seemed to learn anything from his blunders, mistakes or experiences.
He lacked system, orderliness in his work, he was sloppy, slovenly, slipshod, lazy.
He believed he would never be promoted because he wasn’t in with his boss, didn’t have a pull with him.
