We were glad to note the reappearance on the Center, on Saturday last, of our popular Deputy Warden, Mr. Peter Enckler, and we trust his reappearance will prove to be other than temporary. Mr. Enckler is not yet fully recuvered from his recent illness, and bears the marks of the same; but has hopes of being soon back to pristine form.
