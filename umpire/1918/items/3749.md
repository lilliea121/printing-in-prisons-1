AN AERIAL PROBLEM

If a bomb be dropped from an airplane 10,000 feet up, says a writer, and traveling at a speed of 100 miles an hour, it reaches the ground a considerable distance ahead of the point at which it was released, and the difficulty of judging how to hit a particular building is enormous. A machine invented to assist the raiders has been found on a captured Gotha. The main feature is a telescope hung on gimbals and pointing through the floor of the bomberâ€™s compartment. In connection with this is a form of spirit level which brings a bubble into the centre of a glass disc when the telescope is vertical, so that the bomber knows when it is in the position that can be trusted. Below the telescope is a prism, so that the image seen is not an object directly underneath, but at any desired distance ahead, according to the angle at which it is set. For instance, if the airplane is 10,000 feet up, and the speed is such that the bomb must be released half a mile from the object, the prism has to set at an angle of fifteen degrees. Even then the calculation is liable to error, because the density of differant layers of air may vary.
