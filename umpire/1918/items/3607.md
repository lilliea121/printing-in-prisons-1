NOTORIETY SEEKERS NOT WANTED IN NAVY

According to a late report, women seeking notoriety as aspirants to radio operators positions in the navy and naval reserve force were notified by the department that women are not desired for such positions, because they call for long experience and for both land and sea duty. They were advised to enter commercial telegraph companies, thereby releasing men for military duty.
