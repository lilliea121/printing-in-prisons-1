A BREATH FROM “OVER THER”

Walter Tees these days, will show anybody, without the slightest provocation, a button from the tunic of a German prisoner, which his brother, Frank Tees, lately an Overseer of this Institution, but now working over-time as an ‘‘Old Dutch Cleanser’’ recently sent him. His letter states thathe is making 40 mile trips with a motor ambulance daily from Front Line to Base Hospital, constantly under shell-fire, and still he doesn’t want his old job back.

He states that one Ambulance of his unit and it’s driver is among the missing; but whether the Hun got it, or whether the driver took a wrong turning, and is just lost ‘‘Somewhere in France’’ is yet a mystery. The Commander of the unit, when an Ambulance was wrecked, drenched it with gasoline, and applied a mateh, to prevent the Hun from getting it. He has only met with one accident to date of writing; which was when he had a head-on collision with a motor-cyclist while returning to Base. The motor-cyeclist had his ankle sprained, and his machine smashed, while Frank escaped uninjured, tho with the Ambulance so damaged as to necessitate the transfer of the four wounded men he was carrying, to another machine. Well, all that we have to say, is to wish him luck, and to advise him should he ever see the Kaiser trying to cross the road, not to bother about the horn, but rather step on the accelerator.
