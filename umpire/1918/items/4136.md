TO-MAH-TOES 
(With apologies to a greater Poet)

The shades of night were falling fast, 
As round the Gallery there passed;
A wagon loaded to the guards, 
With that sad fruit of all back yards,
To-mah-toes!

“Oh, say!’’ the captive cried, whats this?"
And grasped it in his sturdy fist; 
The quick eruption made him quail,
—To hit your eye it ne’er will fail— 
To-mah- toes!

The captive wiped his mild blue eye, 
And viewed the ruins with a sigh; 
"So pass the glories of this world” 
He said, and thru the wicket hurled, 
To-mah-toes!

They are star boarders in the soup; 
The pot-pie has it’s friendly group; 
The coffee hath escaped them yet, 
But will succumb in time, and get, 
To-mah-toes!

"Oh, touch them not,” the wise one said, 
"Look not upon them when they’re red; 
Or they will tie such knots in you, 
That e’en Doc. Hassell can’t undo,”
To-mah-toes!

The captive spurned the good advice, 
And took, and ate, and in a trice, 
He knew a meeting of protest, 
Was being held beneath his vest, 
To-mah-toes!

The Doctor cut, and probed in vain, 
He split him with, and ‘cross the grain; 
He blistered him both front and rear, 
And took out all his runnin’ gear, 
To-mah-toes!

But could not find their lurking place, 
They’d done their work, and left no trace; 
And so he had to let him die, 
And o’er him carve the reason why, 
To-mah-toes!
