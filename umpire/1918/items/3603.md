MUST WEAR BLUE UNIFORMS

A Washington correspondent writes that it has been decided that members of the new United States guard will rot be permitted to wear regulation khaki and olive drab, despite their complaints that the old army blue uniforms provided have subjected them to the appellation of ‘‘stay-at-home heroes.” War Department officials explained today that blue uniforms such as formerly worn by regulars were adopted for the guard to obviate the necessity of using cloth needed for the fighting forces. The United States guard recently was authorized strictly for guard duty within the United States.
