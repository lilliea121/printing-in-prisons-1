NO BOLTS OR BARS AT THIS HONOR FARM

ANNANDALE, N. J . Oct. 22.—The value of the honor system in handling young prison- ers of the State Reformatory employed in working the State farms in Hunterdon County has been fully demonstrated, according to Frank Moore, -superintendent of the Institu- tions, in his annual report to Governor Edge. Mr. Moore believes the “system, combined with healthful outdoor work, is the best devised for effecting reform among young prisoners. Right from the start the boys employed at the farm have been placed on their honor, He says:

Living quarters were fixed up for the first of them in a farm house and the first night they were there the Officer in charge E. Smith Hoover. told them he and other officers were going to another farmhouse and would leave them alone, on their honor for the night. Their have been no locks, bars, bolts, watchman or anything whatsoever that would make the farm any different from any other in the country ,and never once has the trust reposed in the prisoners been broken.’’
