PHARISEEISM

Someone with a genius for apt description has described the sort of person—to our abiding sorrow we know them well——who is ‘‘long’’ on pious talk, but ‘‘short” on conduct, as having been ‘‘ironed before they were washed.” And we regret that a pardonable candor compels us to note that a lot of such ironing is being done daily in the E. S. P. and that without a single excuse, for goodness knows, there was no washing done previously.

It is perhaps the easiest thing in the world to hold up holy hands of horror at another sin, while all the time you are hugging some pleasant little vices of you own to your bosom, but, pause a moment, and consider: is the easiest thing always the best thing to do? The whole experience of man goes to prove the contrary, and Dante fashioned a hell for the hypocrite which would intimidate the stoutest hearted on a ‘‘close-up.”

There are other things which begin at home other than charity, and he who cleanses the Augean stables of his own mind and heart is much better qualified to point out the deficiencies in his neighbor’s sanitary plumbing. In plain words if some of our number would preach less, and practice more, the E. S. P. would be a much pleasanter place to live in.
