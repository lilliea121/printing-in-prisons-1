WASHINGTON’S BIRTHDAY

It is understood that the date of Washington’s birthday was, according to the calendar at the time of his birth, Feb. 11. This became Feb. 22 when the Gregorian calender was adopted in 1752. The first place to use the new date in celebrating the event is said to have been Newport, R. I. As late as 1778 Washingten himself apparently used the old style in referring to his birthday.
