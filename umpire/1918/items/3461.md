THE LIGHT WITHIN

To be glad of life with all its troubles; with all its discouragements, is one of the infallible signs that the seed of the divine spirit still lives within. It gives you the inspiration to look up at the stars with a feeling of hope, knowing that the beautiful light “which cometh from afar’’ is always shining for those who seek to retrieve a misspent life. Never were truer words ever written than the poetic expression that ‘‘hope springs eternal from the human breast.” Eternal because it comes from ‘‘the Light that never faileth.” It brings you a chance to work out your own destiny—a chance to feel satisfied with your possessions even though humble, though not satisfied until you have made the best of them. It teaches you not to despise anything in the world except meanness and falsehood, and to fear nothing except deceit and cowardice; to be ruled by your admirations rather than by your prejudice and dislikes; to seek not that which is not rightly your own, except it be kindness of heart and willingness to assist those who may be in distress or need. If we do these things, think seldom of our enemies and frequently of our friends, constantly of the redeeming Christ love that binds man to man with bonds stronger than steel, there can be no doubt as to our future welfare, for the guiding spirit of fellowship, brotherkcod and love will serve as the little guide-posts on the footpath of life, that will lead us safely on to the haven of success.
