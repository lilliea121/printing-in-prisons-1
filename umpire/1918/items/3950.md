THE QUESTION

Dear, when I come back to you, 
In a coming Golden Day,
Will I find you false, or true? 
Will you bid me go, or stay?

For the burden of these years, 
Shall I find a sweet-redress?
Recompense for all my tears, 
In your added tenderness.

Should I look into your eyes, 
And no answering spark be there; 
Freedom were a sorry prize, 
Knowing that you did not care.

If I should but find a grave, 
Hidden in the grasses high;
Holding all that I would have, 
What were left me but to die?

I would have you greet me thus: 
Like to lovers parted long;
Remembering the olden trust, 
Forgetful of the olden wrong.

I would have my weary head, 
Lie upon your bosum’s snow; 
While some tender word you said 
Selling all that I would know:

Saying, ‘‘I was ever brave,’’ 
Answering, ‘‘I was ever true.’’
This the greeting that I crave, 
Dear, when I come back to you.
