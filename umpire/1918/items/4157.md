JOHN BARLEYCORN UNPOPULAR

What General Pershing Says: ‘‘There was a time when it was a natural part of a soldier’s existence to drink and carouse. That day is past, with the soldier sworn to defend his county’s flag and representing the power and dignity of the nation. Strong muscles clear brains, high ideals in the soldier, in- crease the fighting efficiency of the army, and these qualities of the citizen insure the permancy of our institutions.”

What Our Associates in the War Say: “We are fighting Germany, Austria, and drink, and, as far as I can see, the greatest of these three deadly foes is drink.” -David Lloyd George, Premier of Great Britain.

“Give me a teetotal army and I will lead it anywhere.’’-Lord Roberts.

“Drink is as much your enemy as Germany.” Raymond Poincare, President of Republic of France.

What the Germans Say: ‘‘Beer is a far more dangerous enemy to Germany than all the armies of France.”—Von Moltke.

“The next war, the next naval encounter, will demand of you soundnerves. These are undermined by alcohol, endangered from youth up, by its use.—The nation which drinks the least alcohol will be the winner.” Kaiser Wilhelm, 1910.
