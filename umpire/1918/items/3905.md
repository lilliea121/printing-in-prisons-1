WHY WE DID IT

We might not fight —as yet; we may not work—as yet; so but one thing remains for us to do, to give, and that to the limit of our ability, and it is that thing that we have done.

We have been paying—are paying now— our debt to a Society whose laws we have scorned, and we Recognize the justice of such payment. It is our debt to our country that we are paying now: our country; whether by birth, or adoption, and loved as such. It is to it that we have given all that we can, knowing ourselves blessed in the giving. We may be outcast, we may have fallen to the depths, but still within the breast of each one of us there burns a spark of that divine fire which men call patriotism, only needing such occasion as this to burn into purest flame.

We did this thing because we could do nothing less, because we are more anxious than we can say to play our little part in the winning of this war, and no other consideration had any weight with us. Men gave to this Cause during the Drive who would not loan President Wilson a nickel on a dime’s security, and nothing but an intense love of country could work such a miracle as this.
