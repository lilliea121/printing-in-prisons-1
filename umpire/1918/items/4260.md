WASHINGTON, Sept. 18â€”The President today authorized placing war contracts with the heads of prisons and reformatories at prevailing prices, and directs that prisoners engaged on such contracts shall receive wages corresponding to those paid for simi- lar work in the vicinity. 

Extensive plans are being worked out for makihg use of the man-power of Federal penitentiaries and other penal instituticns during the war. Congress already has provided for industrial plents at some of th prisons. Let us pray.
