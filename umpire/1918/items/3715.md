SALOON BUSINESS ON THE SLUMP

Increased taxes and costs that are slashing profits will result in the closing of about a hundred saloons in this city May 31, according to D. Clarence Gibboney, of the Law and Order Society.

Mr. Gibboney predicted that when the present license period ends more saloonmen will quit the business than ever before in the local history of the licensed bar.

Under the present system of revenue, the Governmentisreceiving $1,000,000,000 yearly in taxes from the liquor business. The normal revenue, he said, is about $365,000,000.
