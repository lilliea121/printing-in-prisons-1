SKILL OF THE BLIND

Blind people—those who have been born blind—are, as is well known, exceedingly clever with their fingers, but it is not often that one hears of a watchmaker who was born blind, and yet there have been instances of the kind.

A famous blind watchmaker lived at Holbeach, notes an exchange. His name was Rippin, and, although completely blind, he could take to pieces and put together again watches of most delicate construction with the greatest ease and in quicker time than most watchmakers who have the advantage of good eyesight.

On one occasion some of the tiny wheels and screws used in his trade were stolen from him, but the thief was captured with the property on his person, and Rippin identified it by his delicate sense of touch. Another watch and clockmaker brought up his blind son to his trade, and he proved so skilful that on more than one occasion he detected faults in timepieces which other trademen had failed to discover.
