A NEW SHOP OPENS

The new Sox and Underwear Shop begins to-day, June, 26, by the setting going of a dozen hand-machines for the making of Sox.The larger newest-model machines for Underwear and Sox,are yet lacking their motors,but these are expected to arrive within a few days,and be installed, when approximately one hundred men will be given employment; which will greatly lessen the number of idle hands in the Institution.

The old school-rooms have been thoroly made over by Mr. Gillespie’s expert workers, and present a very fair imitation of a Stone & Webster ‘ plant;” and Mr. Hornberger’s operatives are assured of every convenience for the plying of their trade. Underwear and sox of the best grades are expected to be turned out in quantity in the near future.
