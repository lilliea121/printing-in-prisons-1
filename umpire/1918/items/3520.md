A RIVER OF INK

A river of ink is formed in Algeria by the union of two streams, the water of one being impregnated with iron and the other, which drains a great swamp, with gallic acid. This combination of iron and acid forms a pure ink. All rivers in Africa seek the ocean that is furthest away from their source. 

In Siberia rivers flow over ice, old and solid as rock. A tributary of the Lena River has under the soil which forms the bed of the river pure ice more than nine feet thick. A freak of nature is the Lost River in Kentucky. It is known as the Hidden river, because no one knows its origin and it vanishes into a cave leading no one knows where. It flows without a ripple and is a pale, bluish color. 

A singing well is one of the natural curiosities of Texas. In fine weather a sound like that of an aeolian harp is given out by the well. At times the sound is clear, then it recedes.
