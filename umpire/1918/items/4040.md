TAKING OUT THE KINKS

Universal military training is now being advocated by our Government officials including President Wilson. The primary reason for the adoption of such policy is of course grounded in the necessity of adequate preparedness for the national defense. Since the defiant declaration of the German chancellor just prior to the bloody butchery of Belgium in August,1914, that ‘‘treaties are only a scrap of paper’’ it has become increasingly apparent that the only sane and safe course for nations is to proceed on the assumpticn that “to beforewarned” shculd lead to ‘‘forearming.’’

It is a matter of special moment that as all rivilized nations are being forced to this same conclusion, they are also capitalizing, in connection with it, the necessity of proper physical development and manhood building.

The rigid discipline incident to military army life is admirably adapted to removing the kinks from the sissies, stiffening the fiber of the flabby, straightening the stooping frames and shiftless young chaps.
