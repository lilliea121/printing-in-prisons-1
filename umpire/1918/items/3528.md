COLORED MOTION PICTURES BY A NEW PROCESS

According to a recent announcement a new method of making mction pictures in natural colors was shown at a private view in this city. The inventor is Leon F. Douglass, a Californian, who has devoted more than a decade to the development of his idea, which he has now reduced to such a simple and comparatively inexpensive process that it has a decided commercial value.

In previous methods it has been necessary to utilize a color filter on the projection machine, but in the case of Mr. Douglassâ€™s invention the ability to create natural color effects exist in the film itself, which when once made by his process can be run through the ordinary projection machine of any photo-play house. The method employed in hisnew plan is too technical to be gone into here and besides, owing to pending patents, not all its secrets are divuiged by the inventor.

Suffice it to say that the exhibition was in many respects quite a revelation of what is possible along these lines and some of the slight faults noticeable were probably due to the imperfect conditions under which the pictures were shown. There were some wonderful effects nevertheless, particularly in views taken in Yosemite Park, where rainbows were seen in all their fairylike delicacy and at the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, where the varying color aspects of this titan among chasms were reproduced with almost perfect fidelity.
