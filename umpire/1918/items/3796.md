THE E. S. P. HELPS THE LOAN ALONG

Warden Robert J. McKenty, and the entire body of Officers, with the exception of the Watch on duty, took a prominent part in the 15th Ward Liberty Loan Parade on Thursday night last, and according to all reports made an exceedingly fine appearance. Prof. Weigandt, and Sam, and Bill McKenty furnished the martial music, and young and old stepped out like veterans, under the eagle eyes of ‘‘Bob’’ Meyers, and Captain Dutton, who acted as marshals, to the Warden’s Generalissimo. There were some 90 men in line, and we are informed that the enthusiasm ran so high that two, or three dropped out, and bought Liberty Bonds en route. The Chaplain made an address at the Washington Monument, being introduced by Mr. W. A. Dunlap, Marshal of the Parade.
