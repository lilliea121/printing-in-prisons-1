A NOTABLE VISITOR

Dr. J. Medoff, the local Jewish Chaplain, brought Mr. J. S. Prenowitz, city editor, of the Jewish Daily Forward, to see us on Wednesday last, and honored us in so doing. The gentleman is a poet of more than local renown, and Dr. Medoff was pleased to read one of his compositions, which met with.a deserved appreciation. Mr. Prenowitz was most favorably impressed by our surroundings, and spoke of the sincere pleasure it gave him to see how faithfully we adhered, under all circumstances, to the faith of our fathers; and responding to the invitaticn of the writer to return, announced his intention of doing so at an early date.
