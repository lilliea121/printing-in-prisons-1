PERSISTENCY FINALLY WON AFTER ELEVEN REJECTIONS

The case of a man who would not accept rejection came to notice the other day, when David C. Colodny of this city, after trying eleven times to get into some branch of the Government service, being rejected each time on account of nearsighteness, was accepted by the British and Canadianrzcruiting mission. He was enlisted for service with the Jewish contingent that is going to Palestine.

Colodny was a special student in English at the University of Pennsylvania. Until recently he was assistant manager of the bookstore at the Houston Club. His father is a member of the Russian Secret Service.
