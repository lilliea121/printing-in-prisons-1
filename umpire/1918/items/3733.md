COBBLER NOW A PLUTOCRAT

A few years ago, avows a writer, the cobbler pegged away with hammer and awl, read philosophy, ancient and modern, and was the friend of every child in the neighborhood. When one brought him a pair of decrepit shoes he was sympathetic and expressed a kindly doubt whether they could be half-soled and generally over-hauled for less than 65 cents. Nowadays it is different. The cobbler is a plutocrat who owns buzzing machines. When he gives the shoes of last winter the once over he coldly announces that near-rubber soles will be $2 and the heels will be 75 cents. Naturally one reaches the depths of despair in his presence.

It requires but small power of observation to discover that the cobbler lately has ‘‘come back.” Ever since the shoe manufacturer began increasing his prices the people have sought to equalize matters somewhat by wearing their shoes just a little longer. In order to make this scheme work there had to be cobblers. Then the cobblers got to raising prices, and one’s plans for economy were shot full of holes.

While shoemaking by hand is a disappearing art, cobbling never before attained such importance as an industry. The difference is that nowadays they cobble with machinery.
