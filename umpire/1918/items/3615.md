MIXED POPULATION OF HOLY CITY

The exceptionary heterogeneous population of the holy city can be imagincd when one remembers that it is the duty of every good Moslem to make the pilgrimage once. Islam is a widely spread religion. From the south of Africa, from Madagascar, where the old Arab slave trade flourished; from all the states of the Barbary coast the pilgrims come; from the wide domains of the sultan, from Egypt, the Balkans and the near east, and from Afghanistan, India, Burma, China and Japan. Even from under the American flag they come, from the southern Philippine Islands of Mindanao and Palawan. Mohammed promised Mecca that he would make her the center of the cities of the earth and to some extent at least the promise is fulfilled.
