KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS. WAR ACTIVITIES. Camp Sherman November 16th, 1918. The President of Insp. Eastern State Pen., Philadelphia, Pa. Dear Sir:â€” In behalf of the Knights of Columbus and the soldiers of Camp Sherman, we wish to express our thanks to you for your patriotic impulse that led you to send us the games of Go Bang fer the diversion of the soldiers. This life is made-up of mistakes after all, and it gives us pleasure to note that the inmates of the Eastern State Penitentiary are still on the side of the glorious cause, and that their hearts still continue to beat with patriotic impulse. We would ask you to express our thanks to the inmates of your institution for their attempt to also do their bit for the soldiers. Yours respectfully, Clem, T. Kelly. Gen. See K. of C. Camp Sherman. Ohio.
