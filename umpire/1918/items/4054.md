THE SKY-PILOT

As one of the employees in this prison library it is part of my duty to observe and record for future reference the different classes of literature which is sought most by the individual inmates during their years of gervitude,—and it has amazed me often to note of late the great percentage which is now-a-days seeking books of learning from which they can derive some benefit. A wave of yearning for some useful reading seems to sweep through the prison, and whether this has anything to do with the spirit of adjustment which seems to stir young and old everywhere in the outer world today, and which has even penetrated these walls and driven into space the old order of things and brought into our lives opportunities, first to forget our wasted past and next to mold and develop ourselves to meet a greater future, that I do not know; but I find that the men in here more and more are coming to the realization of the wisdom brought out so plainly by our Chaplain on the fly-leaf of the library catalog:

“Every book contains something applicable to each of us, and we should try to eradicate those faults and habits which are not condu- cive tohonesty, truthfulness, and morality. “Knowledge is Power,” and we should en- deavor to use to our profit some of the gocd things thinking men have said and written.”

And so I will dwell a few moments upon the conclusions I have come to as being the causes of this great wave of better under- standing. —

There was a time, and not so many years ago, when almost every merchant ship would defy a ‘‘sky-pilot’’ to board her, and beirg an “Old Salt’’ myself, I could tell of the many futile and comical attempts that I have seen these preacher men make in order to get a footing on the deck of these deep-water ships, our Jack London’s and Russels have written so much about, even though they knew that their successful landing on the deck would have come out-disastrous to them a moment later, but, somehow, their bull-dog tenacity not to give up a good motive nor to weaken because of the Captains and Mates threats and profanity strengthened their standing with the common sailor, who gradually cultivated an admiration for these well-meaning and helpless sky-pilot’s, whom one should think would soon become discouraged from the seemingly fruitless results of their labor;—but it seems that this very tenacity and earnestness of these mission people brought about the desired conditions after all. When I was yet but a boy in these old ‘‘wind-jammers’’ no one dared to sing a hymn aboard, and the most of us were afraid that our Captains or Mates should discover that we had visited some Seamen’s Mission while on shore leave, lest they should make us objects of ridicule and sarcasm during the rest of the voyage.

Today, when a ‘‘sky-pilot‘‘ approaches a ship in the harbor a ladder is lowered down her side for him, and when he steps upon her deck to hold a service the National ensign comes down to the rail, while in its place is broken out the emblem of his calling and officers and men bare their heads, and listen.- And ashore today one sees very seldom a ’’drunken sailor‘‘ ,- and the worlds harbors are as safe at night as the ponds of a park.-

So I am bringing this incident from the life of the sailors to strengthen my argument, that these great and sudden reforms whichare takingplace today all over are but the natural evolution of the courageous work the “‘sky-pilots’’ of the shore have been doing for years, and that their tenacity to hang on against great odds have brought about the admiration and the attention that give them today the free and unlimited admission to al- most everywhere.

So let us remember, that tothe many ‘‘sky pilots’’ bull-dog tenacity to hang on to this old ship in defiance of Captain and Mates, till public opinion passed them safely aboard, do we owe our gratitude for the new order of things, so that men go out from here today better than they were yesterday, because of the human kindness that was brought in to us by those who understood, and whose kind words and acts fell in harmony with our thoughts of by-gone days in happy boyhood, that made us ashamed of the mistakes we had made.

That is why we find so many in here today in their quiet evening hours of solitude perusing books they neglected in years gone by.
