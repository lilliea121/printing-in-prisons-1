SHOULD BE HUMAN

At a dinner given by the Broome County Bar association recently, Justice James C. Cropey, of the Supreme Court of Brooklyn, N. Y., addressed the diners and among other things he said:

‘‘Because a lawyer becomes a judge he should not cease to be human—in fact, there is reason for him to be even more human, as there is greater necessity for him to be broad minded and keep abreast of the times.”

The speaker depreciated the attitude which he said, ‘‘some of the judges of his acquaint- ance manifested toward others while on the bench, which indicates their desire to keep to themselves and to avoid associating with members of the bar, and others.

“This is not so much a loss to the bar as it is to the justices,’’ said the speaker. He de- nounced this attitude of aloofness as ‘‘un-democratic.”

“The exclusiveness or segregation attempt- ed by some of the bench tend to weaken and undermine the public’s confidence and esteem in our judiciary and makes our judges less serviceable—less in touch with modern ideas.’’

Coming from one of the foremost members of the New York state judiciary, it is to be hoped that the admonition will take root and develop where the soil is still fertile.
