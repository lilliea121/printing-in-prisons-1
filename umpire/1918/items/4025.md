FOR SERVICE

July 1st, 1918. 

MRS. MARY F. LOVELL, SUPT.; 
215 SUMMIT AVE. 
JENKINTOWN, PA. 

My dear Mrs. Lovell:

I have your letter relative to the splendid work done by inmate B 8361, and when you see him I wish you would give him my thanks for his patriotic service.

I am interested in a Bill to provide for the granting of conditional pardons in order to permit the Inmates of our Institutions to be paroled for service, and I should be glad to see such alaw enacted. I have done my utmost under the present law to force a decision that would permit this to be done, but it seems impossible under existing conditions.

Very truly yours, 

MARTIN G. BRUMBAUGH.
