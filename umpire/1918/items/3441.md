TORPEDOES ON WHEELS

The latest reperts from across the water informs us that a new war device, is the invention of an English engineer, Strafford Talbot.

Literally, it is a torpedo on wheels which may be propelled toward the enemy trenches and controlled from the starting point by means of attached wires.

The explosive is mounted on a metalic box which rides on four wheels. Attached to the box is a contrivance consisting of a dynamo which propels the wheels. The entire machine is electrically controlled, permitting the explosion of the charge at the desired moment.

Two parallel wires connect the torpedo with the control station. These are carried on spools and unwind as the machine advances. The power is derived from accumulating batteries at the starting point. When it is desired to fire the charge all that is required is to push a button. According to the inventor the total cost of this contrivance 18 about $150.
