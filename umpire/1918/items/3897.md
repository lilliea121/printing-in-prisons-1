WEDNESDAY P. M. BIBLE SCHOOL

A very enjoyable hour was spent on Wednesday Afternoon May 22nd, at the meeting of Chaplain Joseph Welch’s Bible Class. Our friend Mr. Frank Dipple was on hand as usual and conducted the reading of the day’s lesson in unison. Chapiain Welch led the attending inmates in the recitation of the Lord’s Prayer and also made a brief but telling address to the boys. Rev. Charles A. Snavely, pastor of the Third Church United Brethren in Christ, was the speaker for the afternoon, and preached an eloquent sermon that will not soon be forgotten. The work of the Episcopal Cnoir was of the usual high order. Next week Mr. Geo. W. Sanville, of the Rodeheaver Co, and who has endeared himself to us through his interest, and his kindness in furnishing the new hymnals for the Bible Class, will take Mr. Dipple’s place, as Mr. Dipple expects to be absent enjoying a much needed two weeks vacation.
