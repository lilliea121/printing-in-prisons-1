KEEP THE HOME FIRES BURNING
(Till The Boys Come Home) 

They were summoned from the hill-side, 
They were called in from the glen;
And the Country found them ready, 
At the stirring call for men.
Let no tears add to their hardship, 
As the Soldiers pass along;
And although your heart is breaking, 
Make it sing this cheery song.

Refrain
Keep the home-fires burning, 
While your hearts are yearning; 
Though your lads are far away, 
They dream of Home; 
There’s a silver lining, 
Through the dark cloud shining; 
Turn the dark cloud inside out, 
’Till the boys come Home.

Over seas there came a pleading, 
“Help a Nation in distress!”
And we gave our glorious laddies;
Honor made us do no less. 
For no gallant Son of Freedom, 
To a tyrant’s yoke should bend, 
And a noble heart must answer, 
To the sacred call of ‘‘Friend.”
