EXPECT NEXT DRAFT CALL IN APRIL

While no definite announcement has been made by War Departmentofficialsfor the calling of the second draft for the national army, it is most evident that all indications point to either April or May as the probable time when such orders will be issued.

This estimate is based on known preparations for equipping and providing for the men. Supplies for the recruits of the second draft will become available about April 1, and those in position to know claim that the first increments will be called soon afterward.

Plans for the second draft as now under consideration include calling 100,000 a month until the second quota is complete. In that way officials expect to avoid much of the confusion which accompanied the first call. The men will report in a steady stream and be assimilated by the military machine before the next lot is received.
