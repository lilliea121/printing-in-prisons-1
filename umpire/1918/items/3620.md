ARCTIC SUNLIGHT DAZZLING

In addition to the sharp wind there is another perculiarity of the inland ice which adds to the difficulties to be encountered in the Arctic, says anexplorer. That is the extreme intensity of the sunlight, which can be realized only by those who have experienced it. During the summer months the sun shines as brightly there in clear weather as anywhere further south, and this continuous brilliancy is intensified a hundredfold by the reflection from endless fields of glistening, sparkling snow, unrelieved by a single object. The strongest eyes can stand such a blinding glare only a few hours without protection.

We always wore heavy smoked glasses, and when in camp found it impossible to sleep without still further protecting the eyes by tying a narrow band of fur about them to exclude the light. Only when a storm is brewing does this intense light become subdued. At such times, however, the sky and snow take on a peculiar gray, opaque light, which is even more trying than the sunlight.
