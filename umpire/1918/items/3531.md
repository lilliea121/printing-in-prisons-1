FAINT NOT UNTIL YOU TRY

It is not so—you ean regain your place.
One fall brings not defeat. Nor loss.
Unless your conscience stings
From some fell thing you did,
And drives you on to slink along with
Those who prowl in darkened corners
Fearsome of remorse and haunting visions grim.
You can regain your place in life,
For none but you can say
How you shall climb, or why.
If weak you slip and fail to grasp the rung,
Then try anew to blaze away and
Conquer all the handicaps in equal pace 
With winners in the race of life. 
Faint not until you try,—and try
Until you win your place again. 

—S. T. H.
