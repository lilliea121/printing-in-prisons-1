28 GOVERNORS FAVOR CONVICT WAR LABOR

The proposal to place 100,000 of the 200,000 men now in American penitentiaries on a uniform parole to give them the opportunity to help win the war by working in shipyards, munitions plants, railroads and farms was explained last night by Esrl H. Dudding, president of the Prisoners’ Relief Society, of Washington, in an interview.

Dudding frankly said he once was a convict.

He served four years in the Moundsville, W. Va., penitentiary. With Miss Evelyn Abbott, secretary of the society, he passed a day in Philadelphia to inspect the various plants here where 100 one-time prisoners have been placed in the last two months through the effort of the organization.

“We are working on this proposal with all the Governors of the States as well as with the Federal Government,” Dudding said.

“Thus far twenty-eight Governors have declared in favor of the program. The society could place 100,000 men in war work within ninety days. Twenty-five thousand of them would be needed on farms in the West alone.”
