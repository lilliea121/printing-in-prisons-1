LOCAL NEWS

Capt. Parker is breaking in a new "Mann" in his Night Watch. Well here's luck, Mr. Mann.

Captain Dutton akso has a new face in his squad, in the person of Michael McBride, brother of the late Overseer, James McBride. Is he Irish? Sure, Mike!

Mr. Walter Enckler was forced to remain at home on a day of last week, and dally with a bottle of Spring Tonic. Yep, that’s what they call it now-a-days.

We are glad to note that Mrs. Jane Gates of the King’s Daughters, has resumed her weekly visits; she having recovered from her recent illness. We missed her gentle presence.

The Hon. ‘‘Rube" was up-State during several days last week, beating the bushes for slackers of ‘‘ours.” We like ‘‘Rube” personally, but speaking professionally, we sincerely hope he never gets on our trail.

The popular Guardian of the Store-House, Mr. Jimmy Loan, is no longer with us, having left on Saturday to fill another position.
We are sorry to lose Jimmy, for he always had an onion for a ‘‘deserving’’ patriot.
