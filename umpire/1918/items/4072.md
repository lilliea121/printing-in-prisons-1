THANKS

We are indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Crawford, of the ‘‘Office,” for the following excerpt from the letter of an aviator friend, serving with the A. E. F. in France. We are surethat we speak for all in saying that weare very grateful for the good opinion of ourselves therein expressed, and voice a ferwvent hope that the writer thereof will quickly become an ‘‘ace,” as we are sure he merits. And we express the further hope that when he attains to this happy goal he will negleet no opportunity to drop a bomb upon the Kaiser, and one or more of his sons.

“I was very much interested in the paper, and what the fellows have been dving in there. They are doing as much in their way as we fellows over here, and if you can I wish you would give them all my best regards, and especially “Curly, as it seems he engineered the whole thing. Tell them that if any ‘should get into military serviee I would be proud to have them for a‘‘bunkie.” They may have broken our social laws but there is good in them or they would not be willing to stand behind their country so readily. Good luck and best wishes from one of the boys ‘‘Over there.”
