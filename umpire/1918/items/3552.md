BRITISH SOLDIERS DENOUNCE FOES OF TOBACCO

At a recent gathering in this city, Sergeant Potter, of the Black Watch, which, after three months of war, came out with thirty-three survivors of an original 1136, at present a member of the local British recruiting mission, expressed bitter opposition to those organizations and individuals who oppose sending cigarettes to men in the trenches.

“The Anti-Cigarette League calls the cigarette a drug and a poison,” he said, but the term is only relative. It is a drug and it is a sedative, but it is not too much to say that that little paper tube has been the means of saving many a man’s mentality in the stress of this war. Some Young Women’s Christian Association branches have been working hard to send tobaccoless comfort kits, but how can they call that a comfort kit?

“Sergeant Empey has created a false impression in his book that the British soldiers have hot rum before they go into a fight. When they go into a fight they get a ration of two tablespoonfuls for the whole day.”
