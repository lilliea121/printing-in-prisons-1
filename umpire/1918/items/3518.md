A LAUGH

A laugh is just like music, 
It freshens all the day, 
It tips. the peaks of life with light 
And drives the clouds away; 
The soul grows glad that hears it, 
And feels its courage strong—
A laugh is just like sunshine 
For cheering folks along 

A laugh is just like the music 
It lingers in the heart 
And where its melody is heard 
The ills of life depart; 
And happy thoughts come crowding 
Its joyful notes to glee
A laugh is just like music 
For making the life sweet.
