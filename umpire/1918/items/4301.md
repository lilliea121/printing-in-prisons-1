Twine and bread are closely related. The twine that binders use in the wheat fields is made of sisal, which grows in Yu- catan, where it is the subject of monopoly. The Food Administration has taken over control of the imports of binder-twine out- put for 1918 in order to concentrate the buy- ing and to eliminate competition among manufactures, and thus to keep the prices lower than it would be otherwise.
