DO YOU WANT TO GO TOO

Mr. Harry Hartmann, Secretary of the Maryland Advisory Board of Pardon and Parole, has completed the compilation of a list showing the number of prisoners now confined in the Penitentiary, and the House of Correction, who will be eligible for Parole under the law passed at tbe last session of the Legislature. There are 870 prisoners in the Penitentiary, and 215 in the House of Correction, who will be automatically entitled to have their cases reviewed by the Board, beginning June 4, 1918. All prisoners who have served in excess of one year of their sentence will be permitted to appeal to the Board of Parole. And we were born in Maryland, and voluntarily left it!
