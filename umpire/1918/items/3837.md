A MUSICAL EVENING FOR THE E. S. P.

The U. S. Naval Reserve Band, from the Great Lakes Training Station at Chicago; who had been touring the country in the interest of the Third Liberty Loan, were visitors to this Institution on Monday evening of last week, and for the space of an hour charmed the music-lovers among our num- ber, with such melody as—with due apologies to our own Organization—is rarely heard within these walls. They were a credit to their Instructor, the great Sousa, sad his absence was the one thing lacking from what was otherwise for us, a perfect Roman holiday.

Quite a gallery of visitors adorned the Center, and enjoyed the concert with us; notably, Mr. Dunlap, of the Board of Inspectors, and family; Warden McKenty, and family; Mr. Dipple, and a party of friends; and Mr. Votaw, of the Prison Aid Society.
