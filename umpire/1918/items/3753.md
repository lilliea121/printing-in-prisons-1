A MOST MYSTERIOUS RACE

Writing from Luzon, a traveler says that high upon the slopes of Mount Mariveles in the Philippine Islands dwell the lastremnants of an ancient and most mysterious race—the Negritos, or ‘‘little negroes.” Scientists differ hopelessly as to their origin and his- tory, but the traveler who is fortunate enough to penetrate into their carefully hidden villages finds the quaint little people extremely interesting.

Though disinclined to work, the Negrito is indefatigable in the chase. He will hunt all day without eating anything but the mango or banana that he may seize as he rushes by. If dogs are scarce for any reason, women are pressed into service, and these go loping through the bush, yelping in imitation of the canines for which they are substituted.

Sometimes a beater will emerge from the brush carrying a pig he has encountered and killed, or, more important still, bringing news of the sighting of a python. In this case the whole hunt is called in. and its energies directed to the capture of the big snake which, when killed, is carried in triumphal procession to the village, where it furnishes a feast for all who can be gathered together for the great occasion.
