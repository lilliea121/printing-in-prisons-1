EPITAPH FOR AN AMERICAN SOLDIER

He was some mother’s well-loved son,
—So fine he lookt in martial guise—
And now in alien earth he lies, 
And hears no more the tuck of drum, 
Nor sees the shell-flare in the skies. 
Like to the seeker for a prize, 
In some great race that had been run; 
The consciousness of duty done, 
Lookt from his widely opened eyes. 
That freedom have a newer birth; 
That Truth and Justice only reign, 
That Right prevail upon the earth; 
Man’s upward struggle be not vain; 
For this he proved a freeman’s worth, 
And lies dead on Picardy’s plain.
