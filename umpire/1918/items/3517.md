MOTHER’S PRAYER

When I knelt before the altar 
In my innocence and youth; 
And resolved to never falter 
In the utterance of truth, 
There were prayers to heaven ascending, 
Asking grace for me, and care, 
With the song of angels blending— 
’Twas a loving mother’s prayer. 

And, although I pine for pleasure 
And forget my early days, 
Still I know I have a treasure, 
Still I feel that some one prays; 
For when sin or sorrow nears ime, 
Worldly comfort seems to flee; 
Then the holy thought that cheers me 
Is, my mother prays for me. 

Oh, how light we prize the jewel 
Which is ours in joy or tears! 
And how often are we cruel 
In our young and thoughtless years. 
We can only have one mother.
When her spirit leaves us here 
We can never find another 
Who to us will be so dear. 

So I think of her whe bore me, 
She who fondly called me child; 
For her face is still before me 
Like an angel’s, calm and mild: 
And though far away. I’m straying, 
She shall ne’er forgotten be, 
For a voice within keeps saying. 
That my mother prays for me.

—The Rev. William Livingston
