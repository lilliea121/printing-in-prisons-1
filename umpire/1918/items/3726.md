“MURMURING” FLAGSTONES

Those who visit Washington find unique the “murmuring’’ flagstones in the floor ‘Inder the dome of the capitol building which no scientist has been able to explain. The flagstones are some forty or fifty feet apart, and when two persons are standing on them tone in the lowest pitch will be heard distinctly. If either person steps off his particular flagstone he must shout to be understood. Mysterious acoustics of this kind are are throughout the world.
