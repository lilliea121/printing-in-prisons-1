OPPORTUNITY

Opportunity is now holding out both hands to the man behind the bars, saying: “Come, you have made your mistake, and you have reaped the natural harvest, but now you have another and a better chance. Things may look black, life may look hard, success may seem a long ways off, but these adverse conditions should be your greatest spur, and drive you on to certain victory.

Because you are branded in the eyes of the world as a criminal, past and potential, is no earthly reason why you should return hostility, distrust for distrust, but rather a first-class reason why you should roll up your sleeves, and make a fight that will in the end compel the admiration and respect of the most suspicious, and that will lead to your returning here some day as a distinguished visitor, instead of being dragged a captive at some Sheriff’s chariot wheels.

The man who goes out of here these days with determination written all over his face— and the E. S. P. written all over the rest of him —with a real will to succeed, is as certain of success, as he may be of coming back if his first thought is to quench that long accumulated thirst. The doors of opportunity are wide open, inviting you to enter, you don’t even have to knock, if you come close enough you’ll probably be knocked down, and d:agged in, but you must go forward, there can be no standing still. Opportunity never stopped and dragged away the up-holder of the corner-lamp-post, and never wasted much time on an animated clotles-horse. But for those who 1re afraid of soiling their hands on the rungs of the ladder there never was a better time to climb.
