TO OUR TRIBAL BROTHERS
We notice in the late editicn of Stray
Shots, an anouncement of a plan for an or-
ganization of the editors of the prison press,
and we rise modestly in our place near the
foot of the table, to heartily- endorse the
same.

Of course, there will be critics who will
cry ‘‘Impossible!’’, pointing out that the
chief raison d’etre of any such organization
is always to go off into a far-country, on a
date during the summer, and hold a conven-
tion, which would manifestly be impeossible
for us: but none the less, we hold the plan
to be perfectly feasible, and are sure that it
would be productive of gocd. We of such
ilk, are all working to the attainment of the
one end, the elevation of our fellows, and
betterment of their living conditions and in
such work it is co-operation that counts.

In our humble opinion there isn’t an argu-
ment against it, that will hold water, and
very many in it’s favor, and we sincerely
hope that it’s originators will carry it thru
to a successful conclusion; and we stand
ready at any time to put our shoulder to the
wheel-even to the paying of dues.
