From Washington it is announced that the appointment as military governor of the Bethlehem district in Palestine, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the British army, is the honor accorded Isaac Newton Camp, a native of the United States and son-in law of the Rev. Dr. D. A. McClenahan, professor of the Old Testament in the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary.

Word of the appointment was received recently by Doctor McClenahan from his daughter Mrs. Lucille Camp. Lieutenant-Colonel Camp is thirty-two years of age and prior to his appointment as governor of the Bethlehem district he was a second lieutenant in the intelligence corps of the British army. He is a native of New Concord, O., and a graduate of Muskingum College.
