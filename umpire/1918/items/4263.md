A WORD OF GREETING:â€”

To our Friends who have so faithfully ministered to us in times gone by. We ap- preciate it all with hearty assurance of good will and best wishes.

We are doing well and with the care and precautions taken, have so far escaped the scourge that is passing through the country in epidemic.

The Chaplain.
