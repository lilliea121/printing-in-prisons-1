IT DON'T PAY

Crime pays very poor wages, so poor that no one can afford to indulge in it. We obtained an illustration of this on the train. One who was thrown in for life, but who fortunately for himself, and many others, was liberated after serving seven and one-half years, asked me to guess how much he received per diem for the period of his incarceration. He was thirty-five when he was liberated, and had spent one-half of his life behind the bars. Knowing his ability, 1 guessed $1.00 per day. He answered, ‘To high, only 60 cents.’’
