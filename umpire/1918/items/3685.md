EPISCOPAL HIGH MASS

High Mass was celebrated under the auspices of the Episcopal Church in the chapel Thursday morning March 21, by Rev. Father C. S. Hutchison and assistants. A beautiful sermon was preached by Rev. Father Huston, a missionary priest. 

In the afternoon, Rev. Father Hutchison conferred the Holy Sacrament of Baptism upon 12 inmates. Then Bishop Philip Mercer Rhinelander personally took charge of the annual confirmation services, confirming 34 inmates unto the Episcopal Church. He was assisted at the alter by Rev. Father Haywood, Rev. Everton, and Rev. Father Hutchison, Rev. Father Wineman and Dr. Jeffries of the Episcopal City Mission were visitors for the occasion. The Ladies Altar Guild was represented by Mrs. and Miss Connelley and Sister Lydia. The King's Daughters by Miss Leaf and Mrs. Sommonetti. The occasion will be a lasting one in the minds of those who participated. The beautifully decorated altar and the costly embroidered vestments of the Bishop and Priests, the chants, songs of praise and thanks which were sounded melodiously through the stillness, and the solemnity which prevailed throughout the entire service all bespoke the presence of the Unseen Leader.
