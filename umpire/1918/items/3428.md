TO TEACH TRADES TO DRAFTED MEN

A Washington correspondent writes that representatives of about 100 engineering and scientific schools and colleges recently discussed with the Federal Board for Vocational Education the problem of training a quarter of million drafted men in special lines of work before they are sent to the military camps.

The plan is to train the men in technical schools in a semi-military atmosphere, and the board recommended that schools selected be closed May 1 and turned over to the Army until next October. Among trades in which the men will receive instruction are gas engine work, magneto repairing, acetylene welding, truck driving, sheet-metal work and automobile repairing, and the board will recommend that they be allowed regular pay and subsistence during the instruetion period. It is estimated that 10,000,000 will be needed to cover the actual expenses of the work, including the necessary equirment. In that connection it was announced today that an offer of the international Acetylene Gas Association to furnish equipment for training acetylene welders and to pay instructors where volunteers are not available has been accepted.
