AMERICA’S FOUR DECLARATIONS

Four great historical documents marking progressive epochs in our national history, give the essential definition of Americanism in politics, says the New Republic. First in the Declaration of Independence, signed July 4, 1776, proclaiming the principles by which the United States justify their independence of European domination. Second is President Monroe’s message to Congress of Dec. 2, 1823, announcing the right of the people of the Western Iiemisphere to pursue their political destinies without interference from Old World powers. Third is Lincoln’s memorial address at Gettysburg, Nov. 19, 1868, in which the rights of Americans to their own continents are affirmed to be inalienably democratical, and without democracy to be forfeit. Fourth is the message delivered by President Wilson at the joint session of the two houses of Congress April 2, 1917, asserting the value of the democratical polity to the whole territorial world and the right to it of the entire human race.
