MOTHER’S DAY, MAY, 12, 1218 

For a day, or for an hour, 
You may wear a snow-white flower, 
On your breast; 
For the one, who all-forgiving, 
Whether dead, or whether living, 
Loves you best. 
Who believed when others doubted; 
Praised you still, when others flouted; 
Knew the good that others scouted; 
Stood the test. 
Yours a debt too great for payment: 
Love is more than food, or raiment; 
This she gave. 
What’s the flower that you’re wearing, 
To the sorrow that she’s bearing, 
To the grave? 
Since in travail first she bore you; 
She has fought such battles for you; 
Never ceased her watching o’er you;
Quick to save. 
What’s the recompense you’re giving? 
Just a flower for the living, 
For the dead. 
Tho you wear a flower forever; 
You could thus repay her, never; 
Wear instead: 
In your heart the will to be good, 
Bear life’s ills, and smile—as she would; 
Win you back the joys of childhood, 
That have fled.
