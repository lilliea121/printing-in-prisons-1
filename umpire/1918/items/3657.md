“RUNNERS” MUST GO— BARRED FROM CITY HALL

It is announced that the local authorities have opened a campaign against professional bondsmen and their agents, who have been notorious in the corridors of the City Hall for many months.

For a long time the halls and corridors on the sixth floor of the City Hall has been obstructed by the presence of agents for professional bondsmen, and it is only of late that there has been the slightest attempt to disturb them in their pernicious activities.

Director of Public Safety Wilson is quoted ‘as saying that ‘‘in the future the halls and corridors of the City Hall must be freed of loiterers and others who have become a source of annoyance to persons having business to transact with city officials in the building.”
