THE H. F. C. REMEMBERS A VERY GOOD FRIEND

On Friday afternoon last the Board of Governors of the H. F. C. presented to Warden Robert J. McKenty, a framed Satin Piece, with a design of American, and British Flags painted thereon, similar to the one presented Capt. Fallon. It was a beautiful thing, and the Warden was visibly pleased with his gift.

Speaking in reply to the presentation speech of Vice-President A 8432, he expressed himself as being very much indebted to the H. F. C. and assured us of his continuing efforts to advance our real interests; that our welfare was ever nearest his heart; from ‘‘Pete, and Doug’’ in their palatial ‘‘apartments,’’ to the humblest ‘‘penitent” in the First Block ‘‘caves;” and said that his one thought was to lift up, and not pull down: and we knew he meant every word of it. His last words were, ‘‘Here’s where the McKenty family gets another heirloom,” and we knew that meant our little gift would have a place of honor in the parlor.
