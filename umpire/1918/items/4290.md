A NOTE FROM FRANCE

Our own Bob Perry, who can so distribute drugs as to lead the dlighted recipient to bleive he is getting a sample bottle of "pop" has had a real button from the uniform of a real boche sent him by Mr. Frank Tees, and contemplates wearing it as a stud in his one dress shirt. Frank announces that he has ducked every thing Fritz has in the way of bullets and bombs, and that after smelling both dead and living Huns, gas is as new-mown hay to him. Unless the Boche can think up some new engine of war, he feels confident of coming thru it safely. He tells Bob that he feels suere he would like to be over there, and Bob confirmed this opinion in an interview, and stated that if they would but call an intermission for a few months, we would be on hand.
