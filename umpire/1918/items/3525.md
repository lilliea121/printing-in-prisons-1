WAR MEDALS TO NAVY MEN

A Washington correspondent writes that Secretary Daniels has announced the award of medals of honor to Seamen Ora Graves, of Maxwell, N. M., and Tedford H. Cann, of New York city, for extraordinary heroism.

An explosion aboard the U. S. S. Pittsburgh, December 23, threw Graves to the deck, but he extinguished burning waste near powder in the casemate.

Cann entered a flooded compartment of the United States patrol vessel May on November 5, stopped a leak and saved the vessel from sinking. Cann is the first naval reservist to receive a medal of honor.
