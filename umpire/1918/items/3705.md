ABOUT THE ICE AGES

About fifty years ago English geologists recognized the fact that certain masses of gravel and breccia and certain planed and grooved rock surfaces in rocks of Permian age in India indicated a glacial epoch vastly older than that of the North American ice sheets, but only within the last thirty years have geologists learned that glacial conditions have recurred at many different times in the earth’s history. The evidence of this fact has been found in all continents—in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, South America, and North America. Great ice sheets were formed at different periods in the larger divisions of geologic time back to the Proteroboic—that is, to the age of the oldest known sedimentary rocks, a great many million years ago.

One of the most recent discoveries of old glacial deposits is that made by Prof. W. W. Atwood, near Ridgeway, in south-western Colorado. Professor Atwood there found typical glacial "till," containing pebbles and boulders showing well-preserved scratches and other markings, lying beneath Tertiary lavas of the San Juan Mountains and resting upon Upper Cretaceousbeds. The conditions of the occurrence show that these gravels are of early Eocene age.
