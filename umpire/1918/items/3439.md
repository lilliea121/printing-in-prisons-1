CHURCH BUILT ON A PIER

An unusual site for a church is to be found at Ilfrancombe, England, which has a church built on a pier, and it is the only seaside place in the world that hassuch adistinction. Indeed, Ilfrancombe would not possess the honor were it not for the fact that Lanterin Hill forms a part of the pier. Those who argue about the matter are always silenced by the plea that you have to go on the pier in order to enter the church, observes a writer.

The curious old building to be seen on the top of the hill has many strange adventures. It is dedicated to St. Nicholas, the patron saint of seafaring folk, and in that connection it is interesting to learn that at one time the old church was used as alighthouse.

In bygone days the sailors used to trudge up the hill to pray before going to sea, and many were the regrets when the little edifice ceased to hold its services. It is now used by the pier authorities for storing purposes, but the day may come when it will be restored, and form one of the many attractive “sights’’ Ilfrancombe already possesses.
