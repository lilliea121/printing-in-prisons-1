Painters and decorators have been at work in our hospital wards for the last couple of weeks or more and took away their pots and stages today. The patients who have been temporarily cared for in the Emergency hospital have returned to a most clean and healthy looking abode, the walls and ceilings of which have been so wisely blended in colors that they give to the bedridden unfortunates a most cheerful aspect, and must undoubtedly be another of Dr. Hassel's secrets in preserving so commendably the health of the Institution.
