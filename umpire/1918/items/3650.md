INVENTS NEW STABILIZER

A correspondent writes thatan Easton, Pa., inventor has just been notified that the Government has granted him a patent on an automatic stabilizing device for airplanes. The device may be attached to a machine of any size or design, and Galle has offered the free use of the patent to the United States during the present war, and it soon will be given an official trial.

“In some respects, the device will revolutionize flying, as it will reduce the danger to an almost unthought of degree,” says the inventor. ‘It will also enable the operator of a machine gun on an airship to do more effective work, because he can get a better and more uniform line of sight.” Galle is a native of Italy, but is a naturalized American and has served in the Army.
