SHINE ON, RED CROSS! For the healing of the nations God has set you in His sky As a never-failing promise that His mercy from on high Shall be showered, without' favor, on the stricken far and nigh When Pain and Death stand by! With the blood of many heroes He has painted you, to say; "Thru the darkness of disaster I will guide you to the way That shall lead from Hope's despairing to the glory of the day Where Joy once more holds sway!" In the yearning of a woman who had heard the cries of woe From the dread Crimean stretches, you were mothered long ago, That the forces of destruction might be smitten in their flow By love's unending glow! Thru the wreck and waste of battles you've kept shining for the soul That in peace is now awaking to the glory of the goal To behold the heavenly vision of a world once more made whole When strife no more takes toll! Leigh Mitchell Hodges
