LINCOLN’S BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION

The American Alliance for Labor and Democracy has issued a proclamation calling for the observance of a national labor loyalty week in the United States, in connection with the celebration of Lincoln’s birthday anniversary this year. This should have a hearty response, since one of the principal purposes is to combat ‘‘the insidious forces of pro-German and anti-American propaganda.’’ There is, however, no occasion for suspending necessary work in order to observe the week. The best possible way to observe it, in fact, is to increase the outrut of products that are essential to the winning of the war. Nothing will hit the pro-German or anti-American propaganda more powerfully than an incresse in the shipment of supplies to the front and to allied nations.
