THE SCHEME IN A NUTSHELL

1. To grant amnesty to all State Prisoners for service in the war—the Army, Navy, the Air, or at such labor as the war demands — who, in the opinion of Boards of Enquiry appointed by Federal authority, are physically and morally fit.

2. To draft those selected into the various divisions of the Army and other arms of the service without any badge or method of identification as to their having been in prison. There is no idea of forming a seperate unit.

3. That the selected be put on exactly the same terms as other men in the firing lines and in the event of their violating the rules of war they be court-martialled in exactly the same way as soldiers or sailors.

4. That each Prison beallowed to display a Service Flag showing the number enlisted from respective prisons, and that a monthly meeting be held in the prisons of a patrietic character to commemorate their devotion to the Stars and Stripes, and that prisons be given the option to ascist the relatives and dependents, if any, of the men at the front or doing their bit. 

5. That the men volunteer for service, no compulsion being used at all.
