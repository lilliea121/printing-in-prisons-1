THE RED CROSS NURSE

Amid the cannon’s roaring, in the thickest of the fight
Where the shrapnel flies like dust, throughout the star-lit night, 
You may see a white-robed figure, as she slowly wends her way 
Among the sick and wounded, fallen in the fray.
Among’st the Nation’s heroes, she hassurely won her place
For her bravery on the battle-field, where she met death face to face,
And when life’s toil is over, and she is called to her reward
Her’s will be the greatest, that the God’s shall ere award.
Upon the banks of the Oise, that slaughter house of death
Where many a gallant hero, lies gasping for his breath,
You will find her seeking, wounded everywhere
As she stills the cries of anguish, that pierce through the air.
And when the strife is over, and Freedom’s cause is won
And the golden rays of peace, shine down from God’s bright sun,
We shall bow our heads in reverence, and sweet homage will be done
For the silent white-robed figure, who died, for the man behind the gun.
