TWELVE DAYS FROM THE SEA

The first ‘‘Welland Canal size saltwater vessel,” built at Manitowoe, Wis., under the direction of the Emergency Fleet Corporation of the United States Shipping Board, commanded by Captain Frank Dotty and manned by a crew of thirty, recruited at the offices of the Lake Carriers’ Association in Milwaukee, will, it is planned, sail for Portland, Me. The voyage through the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River, approximately 2,300 miles, will require twelve days.

Because of the limitations of the Welland locks, the dimensions of the vessel, which bears the name of War Victor, had to be brought within 270 feet, as to length, and 14 feet 6 inches, as to draft. The important thing is that it will be followed quickly by many other wooden ‘‘feeders’’ for the Allies from the inland seas of the United States.

Manitowoc is a very busy town, and it has at hand all the facilities for ship building “while you wait.”
