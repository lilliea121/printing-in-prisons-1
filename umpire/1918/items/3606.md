POOR TO BENEFIT BY NEW GAMBLING LAW

It is announced in a late news despatch that the poor of New York city will reap a large financial benefit from the John Doe inquiry into gambling conditions, District Attorney Swann predicted. Help for them will come from the enforcement of a law which provides that ‘‘a person who wins or loses at play or by betting the sum or value of $25 or upward within the space of twenty-four hours is punishable by a fine not less than five times the value or sum so lost or won.”

According to the law, Mr. Swann said, the Commissioners of Charities would be the nominal plaintiff in civil suits to recover the money, which must be used only for the poor.
