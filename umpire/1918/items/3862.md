WORKING THE CONVICT

It was announced yesterday, that the use of able-bodied jail prisoners and institutional inmates for farm and War Garden work had been given the sanction of the Food Administration, and that experiments along that line were now in progress in several of the eastern counties of this state. A report made yesterday to Howard Heinz, State Food Administator, by the State Board of Public Charities show some interesting results.

Under a law passed by the last Legislature, prisoners can be sent outside to perform various forms of labor, the prison warden being released from responsibility upon their vonds for the security of the prisoners; In Montgomery county prisoners are being paroled by the Courts to assist farmers in planting their crops this spring, and the results have been gratifying. In Bucks county 10 prisoners paroled by the Court have been put to work in factories where they have proved to be valuable laborers.

The State Board of Charities expresses a hope that they may be able to extend the system so that the jail population of the State may become largely self-supporting. It is the hope of the Board that results will show the wisdom of continuing thisplan after the end of the war, tho the present law only permits the continuance of such labor system for the duration of the struggle.
