The State Board of Parole of New York, in reporting that 25 per cent of that State’s prisoners violated their parole in 1917, expresses disappointment that the percentage should be so large, to which the New Era replies: “While we would be gratified if the percentage were smaller, yet the fact that 75 per cent make good, certainly does not furnish ground for discouragement. If one hundred ordinary citizens should be subjected to the same severe test as is imposed upon a man by the parole surveillance for one year, would three-fourths of them do as well?”
