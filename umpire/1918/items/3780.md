HERE’S LUCK TO YOU, WILLIAM

Reading, Pa., April 16, 1918. 
Mr. Robert J. Mckenty, Warden, 
Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, Pa. 

My dear Mr. McKenty:—

Mr. Reuben McKenty called on me today and handed me the contribution made by the men under your care to the cause of William Webber. I wish you would convey to them my thanks and appreciation of their unselfish conduct in giving substantial aid to the cause of one of their number who is seeking a release. I have every confidence in our ultimate success.

With regards, I am, 
Yours very truly, 
W. K. STEVENS.
