FINE!

Quite a number of our fellows have purchased Bonds of the third Liberty Loan, and in so doing have done their little "Bit’’ for their country. The little button they have gained thereby, is perhaps their most necessary article of clothing, and we don’t blame them a particle; we would be very glad to be able to wear such a badge of honor on our own breast, but the Editorial salary being chiefly paid in onions, and potatoes, we just couldn’t make it.

We would like to see everyone of us wearing such a badge, it’s just the same as carrying a gun, for the Hun can be beaten with Bonds, as well as with bullets, and, indeed, the one can’t be had without the other. We are very proud of the local spirit of patriotism thus shown, though it was no more than what we expect. We’re all Americans here, even if we mayn’t be citizens.
