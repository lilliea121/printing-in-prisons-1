SHIPBUILDERS WILL NEED 85,000 MORE MEN

A local authority declares that at least 85,000 men will be required to complete the 272 ships building or under contract in Deleware River shipyards for the Emergency Fleet Corporation, according to W. B. Fergusson, the Philadelphia representative. He said more than one-third of the war vessels and merchant ships being constructed in the United States were being built in the eleven shipyards from Trenton to Deleware City.

Contracts for forty ships have been awarded to the Merchant shipbuilding Corporation at Bristol. More than 5,000 men are now employed at this yard, and to finish the vessels in contract time it is estimated that 10,000 more men will be needed.

The working force of 500 men at the Cornwells shipyard wiil be increased to 2000 to turn out the ten vessels that have been awarded to that yard

Sixty vessels are being built in one Philadelphia shipyard. Five thousand men are employed and all the vessels are for the Government. If they can be found, another 1000 men are to be put to work. It is said that 2,250,000 tons will be the Delaware Riverâ€™s first contribution toward the new merchant fleet.
