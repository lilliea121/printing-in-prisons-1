THE CHAMPION SPELLER

Prof. David Jones, the world’s champion speller, retired on a well-earned pension after schoolteachlng for 50 years in Missouri, notes an exchange. For 33 years the champion issued an annual challenge to all comers to spell against him. Many tried to wrest from him his title, but none succeeded.

His record is 15,000 words correctly spelled straight off the reel at one sitting without a single mistake. Professor Jones defeated in spelling contests heads of universities, famous teachers, scholars, authors, and professional proof-readers, and his sideboardis loaded with silver cups and other similar trophies won all over the country at the once popular ‘‘spelling bees.” With him spelling is an art just as music or painting or sculpture is an art with others. He pounces on and treasures a rare and difficult word as eagerly as an enthusiast does on a scarce and elusive butterfly.
