HAVING EARS TO HEAR

Some of us who have trouble in deciding what is God’s will for our lives may not have been hearing His voice. If any cherished sin is dulling our hearing we cannot expect clear guidance. A young man was standing with an older friend at the edge of a mountaln woodland as the evening settled over the landscape. Suddenly the younger man whispered: ‘‘Listen, can you hear that?’’ “No,’’ said the older man, ‘‘I don’t hear anything.” “Now,’’ again whispered the younger, ‘‘there it is; do you hear it now?” The older man smiled regretfully: ‘‘No I am afraid I don’t.” And then there fell upon his ears a very faint and distant note which for an instant he caught, like the sound of a bell far away. ‘‘I heard that,” he said. ‘‘Yes,’’ said the one with keener ears, ‘‘that’s the most beautiful note in all the woods, the song of the hermit thrush.” The older man did not hear it at all at first, and could only do so with an effort. It ought not to be so where God speaks to us. The most beautiful note in all the world, the voice of God speaking to the human soul, ought to fall upon eagerly sensitive ears. Is there anything that is dulling your hearing?
