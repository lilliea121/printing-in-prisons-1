We are glad to note the re-appearance of the Deputy-Warden, Mr. Enckler, on the Center; after a fewdays absence, due to illness; but our satisfaction is tempered with a real regret at the reported serious condition of Captain Souder, whom, we are sure, everyone wishes a speedy recovery, and an early return.
