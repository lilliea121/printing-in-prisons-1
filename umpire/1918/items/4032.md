A WORD TO OUR READERS

We are pleased to call to the attention of our readers, the above galaxy of wit and wisdom —we had almost said beauty—who have consented to assist us in our arduous task of editing this publication, and so enables us to view with equanimity a threatened enlargement of the same.

It is our hope that the UMPIRE may voice yet more truly the thought and purpose of the entire Inmate body, and be the better enabled to strengthen the bonds of sympathy and understanding between inmate and Official; and become, also a real medium of expression to the outside world. It is our collective purpose to hew to the line, let the tips come whence they may.

—The Editor.
