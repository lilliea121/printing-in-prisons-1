MAKES LAWYERS SQUIRM

A Washington correspondent writes that a patition signed by Walter Smith, of Philadelphia, and other members of the American Bar Association, calling attention to what they term the unfairness of the suppertax on professional incomes provided in the war-revenue bill and asking for the repeal of that section, was presented to the Senate by Senator Smoot and referred to the Finance Committee.

Strange how the old notion sticks with the legal fraternity that they are a privileged class, or a little above the law for the layman.
