MUSIC HATH CHARMS

The Concert given by the Ladies of San Domingo Choral on the Center, Sunday afternoon, made a very pleasant beginning for the new week, and an equally pleasant break in the inevitable monotony of prison-life.

Directed by Mr. Thomas F. Hogan, with Miss Loreto McCann at the piano, the ladies sang nine numbers of varied beauty and power, culminating in the magnificent ‘‘Gloria’’ of Mercadantes, rendered by a double Quartette of mixed voices. During an interlude, Miss McCann, who possesses the unique and beautiful accomplishment of being perhaps the best whistler whom we have ever heard, whistled the aria ‘‘Oh! I have sighed to rest me’’ from the Miserere, in Il Trovatore, following with a medley of popular airs, including the peculiarly beautiful “There’s a Long, Long Trail,” and ending a much-applauded performance with the ever-delightful ‘‘Mocking-Bird.”

It was a ‘‘crowded hour’’ of song, that they gave, and the ladies of the Choral were highly, and deservedly, complimented by Chaplain Welch for their splendid work.
