THE THING THAT COUNTS

It isn’t the work we intend to do, 
Nor the work we’ve just begun; 
That puts us up at the ladder’s top, 
It’s the work we’ve really done.
Success is built on the things we do, 
Defeat of the things we shirk;
And theman who counts when the day is thru, 
Is the man who completes his work.
Good intentions will bring no joy,
It’s easy to wish and plan;
But that is like to the play of a boy,
 To do is the'test of the man.
