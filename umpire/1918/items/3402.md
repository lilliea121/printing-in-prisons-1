U. S. LABOR DRAFT LIKELY

Adequate labor supply maintained without class exemption for workers in the vital industries or on farms is looked for by Major-General Enoch H. Crowder, in advocating that congress amend the section draft act to provide for the registration of men who have attained twenty-one years of age since June 5th. 

It is looked to as quite probable that draft of labor will be made, and that the Government will have full power of control in such a step. 

General Crowder, in his annual report sent to Congress, takes the position that it is necessary to retain workers in ship-building operations, in munition factories and on farms, but he believes that the deferred classification will care for them unless the nation is reduced to the ultimate extremities of needing such men in the field.
