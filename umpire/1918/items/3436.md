WHY THE DIFFERENCE?

Writing from an army camp ‘‘somewhere in England,’’ Sergeant Howard Neil, formerly of Abington, comments on the prices of different articles in England in comparison with the prices charged in this country for the same thing, despite the fact that England has been at war for over three years and a half. He says: "I can’t understand. it. Everything here is cheap; many things are at one-fifth the price we had to pay for the same things at home. The scarcest articles are sugar and wheat bread. One scracely ever sees an automobile, due to the prohibitive price of gasoline; and if a motorist drives farther than a certain distance he is subjected to a fine, just as for any other motor law violation. 

“There is no toadying here to politicians or to the wealthy class. They all have to buckle in and ‘do their bit.'”
