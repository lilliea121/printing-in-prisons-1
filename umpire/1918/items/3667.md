SEES ALL NATIONALITIES

Writing from ‘‘some place in France,” an American soldier declares that he is having a remarkable experience on the battle front. “Nights I sit and listen to the stories of Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa and all the English speaking lands,’’ says another American ‘‘over there,” ‘‘They must be wonderful countries and the men from them sure are men. I like the Australians best of all. They are a stalwart, clean-looking and reliable body of men; and remind me of our Westerners. I lave a splendid opportunity to see all races of the world walking about here. There are Hindu princes, Serbians, French, English, Welsh, Scotch, Australians, Canadians, New Zealanders, Portuguese, South African Zulus, an Arab chief in his flowing white robes, now and then, Rumanians, in fact all the nations of the world, even Germans who unload the freight cars and mend roads. It is a wonderful experience, if it doesn’t last too long.”
