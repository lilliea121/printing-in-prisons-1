IN MEMORIAM—I1918

We have no flowers, to take and strew, 
Over the low green mounds of you; 
O wearers of the Blue, the Gray! 
We have, alas! to little claim; 
Who wear the livery of shame, 
And are so less than men to-day; 
To do you honor in men’s sight; 
Who bore you well in that Great Fight, 
And kept that safe, we tosst away.

You saved a Nation, freed a Race; 
To-day your grand-sons take your place, 
Beneath the old Red, White, and Blue: 
To stem a world-wide tyranny; 
To make all peoples ever free; 
To such task consecrate, and true, 
And we, blood-brothers to them all, 
Who may not answer to that call, 
Do give them each their fitting due.

Unto the dead, our heads are bowed; 
We to the living, cry aloud, 
“Give you, as e’er your fathers gave!” 
Better the heart’s last drop were shed, 
Than alien flag wave overhead. 
—None but 0ld Glory there must wave!— 
To you, whose fight is o’er, and done; 
To you, whose fight is but begun; 
We give such honor as we crave.
