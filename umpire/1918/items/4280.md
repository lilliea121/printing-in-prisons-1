HOW ABOUT IT?

When E. S P. days are over,
And you dwell once more in clover, 
Will you be the thoughtless rover, 
And, of course come back?
Or, your lesson learned forever, 
Will you leave the straight path never, 
Keep the way of high endeavor, 
Ne’er again come back.
When old ‘‘pals’’ in accents mellow, 
Say ‘‘come on be a good fellow.”’ 
Will you show the streak of yellow, 
That will bring you back? 
Will you say ‘‘I’m on the wagon.’ 
Or surrend’ing take a ‘‘jag’’ 
And come right straight back.
Think of all the soup you’ve eaten,
Of the tea you’ve had to sweeten, 
And resolve you won’t be beaten, 
That you’ll not come back! 
Think of all the pills you’ve taken, 
For a broken leg, or achin’ 
“Tummy,’’—and asleep, or wakin’, 
Vow you won’t come back.
Never let up for a minute, 
On the fight, when once you’re in it; 
Just remember you can win it; 
And you won’t come back. 
When you feel yourself a-slippin’, 
Just keep in your sand-box dippin’, 
‘Till once more your wheels are grippin’, 
And you can’t come back.
