ABOUT BUTTONS

Back of a question raised by a Bostonian lurks a tense scene with an Indian background. Lurk with this to the end, and then don’t accuse us of not presenting novelty:

Herbert Maxwell asked: ‘‘Is it possible to trace to its source the invariable rule under which the clothes of men button from left to right, and the clethes of women from right to left?’’

John D. Dobson, of Woonsocket, R. I. writes: ‘‘Simply because it came easier for the ‘ladies’ maid’ to perform the office of buttoning.” Have you ever noticed how awkward it is for your tailor when he buttons your coat?

Why are there two buttons on the back of a man’s coat? Some think they are a survivial of buttons used on eighteenth century riding coats. When the wearer was on his horse the coat-tails were buttoned up.

A tribe of North American Indians, deep believers in the value of symbolism, refused to heed a missionary because he could not explain to them the significance of these two buttons.
