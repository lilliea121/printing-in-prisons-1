BEAUTIFYING THE POTATO

A. Hickman, an aged gardener of Eureka, Cal., has succeeded in crossing the familiar Irish potato with the dahlia, the combination producing a species of potato which is believed to be far superior to that found ordi- narily on the market. With the new potato one may have flowers for the decoration of his home and, when the plants have reached maturity, potatoes for his dinner. The main value of Hickmanâ€™s potato-dahlia comes frcm the fact that the plant follows closely the dahlia type and hence should be immune from the blight, the great potato scourge of the Northwest. The new potato is said to have a flavor far superior to that of the ordinary potato. It bears heavily.
