PRE-COLUMBIAN CIVILIZATION

Prof. Elliot Smith has been recently developing in an extraordinary interesting manner the thesis that the pre-Columbian civili. zations of America—or at least many important features in those civilizations—were not truly aboriginal, but came in a cultural wave from Asia across the Pacific ocean, the original starting point of the most remarkable characteristics being Egypt, observes a writer in Science Progress.

Professor Smith believes that the extremely peculiar culture of Egypt was spread east. wards by mariners, mainly Phoenicians, for several centuries after B. C. 800. To quote the author’s own woras, he thinks that ‘‘the essential elements of the ancient civilizations of India (the pre-Aryan civilizations,) Further India, the Malay archipelago, Oceania and America were brought in succession to each of these places by mariners, whose Oriental migrations began as trading intercourse between the eastern Mediterranean and India some time after 800 B. C., and that the highly complex and artificial culture which they spread abroad was derived largely from Egypt (not earlier than the twenty-first dynasty,) but also included many important accretions’’ from other sources, and that after traversing Asia and Oceania, and be. coming modified on the way, the stream finally “continued for many centuries to play upon the Pacific littoral of America, where it was responsible for planting the germs of the pre-remarkable Columbian civilization.”
