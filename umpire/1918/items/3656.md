LESS SWEETS AND MORE BULLETS WILL WIN WAR

An American soldier in France shows the proper spirit in a recent letter to a relative in his home town. He says: ‘‘Don’t waste valuable space with unneccessary sweets that should be used for needed ammunition and Red Cross supplies. Candy, jam and cakes taste fine, and we appreciate all that is being done for us, but sweet stuff and such things won’t do much good when the Germans start the next offensive against us, so don’t clog the depots with unessentials.”

Postmaster-General Burleson, to whom the letter was shown, says that if ‘‘proper attention were given the matter of sending things to the soldiers, so that only essentials were forwarded, it would greatly help to win the war.”

“Complaints of delays to the soldiers’ mail usually are followed by letters stating later that the mail is being delivered as promptly as circumstances wiil permit,’’ said Mr. Burleson.

‘It is seldom that a complaining spirit is shown by the boys in France whose letters do not come so speedily as desired,’’ he concluded.
