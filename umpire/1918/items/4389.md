Sproul and Beidleman are elected by a huge majority. The Governor-elect's declaration of purpose: "My one thought and purpose is to do those things for Pennsylvania that a new day demands; to seek those fundamental changes which I believe are necessary if Pennsylvania is to advance to full realization of the promise of this progressive age." He may call a Constitutional Convention. And let us hope he won't forget those medieval penal laws. Only 88 new cases of influenza reported in the city during the last week, as compared with 730 the week previous. Deaths for the week numbered 812, being a decrease of 969 from the previous week. The toll of deaths in the State from the disease is about 38.000 to date. Here's hoping it don't come back. There are lots of men who have a good aim, but persist in wetting their ammunition. New Jersey's legislature, safely Republican, may vote the State dry; the party being pledged to Prohibition. If that's the case, why build that bridge across the Delaware?
