TO THE ‘‘UMPIRE’’

On Saturday afternoon the women of the second Block were able to forget the gloom of the gray walls, through the kindnessof the Warden and the earnest efforts of the H. F. C. minstrels, to whom we extend our heartiest thanks and look forward to a return date in the very near future.

We are anticipating a gay social season as soon as our ‘‘pleasure palace’’ is completed, date to be announced later. Our matron Mrs. Boal enjoyed the performance as well as we, but what pleased her most was the manner in which we conducted ourselves through out

We also wish to congratulate and thank the performers on their successful efforts to dispel all gloom, which they certainly did and tea-time came all to soon.

Our thanks are also extended to master Robert McKenty for the wonderful way in which he rendered ‘‘Over There.’’

No wonder Grandpa smiles. Three cheers and a tiger for our Warden, from,

The Women of the 2nd Block.
