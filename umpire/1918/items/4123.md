INSTINCT STRONGER THAN REASON

That even in man instinct is sometimes stronger than reason is illustrated by the following incidents:

There had been shipped on a Mississippi river steamboat a box with a glass cover, containing a very active rattlesnake. Whenever any one approached the box the serpent would strike the cover. The owner of the reptile challenged any one to hold his finger on the glass and let the rattler strike it. There was no danger, and it seemed an easy thing to do. First one and then another tried it, but when the snake gave its vicious spring the finger was invariably drawn back with a jerk. Instinet was stronger than reason and will combined.

A young man in Paris had lost his last sou at the gambling table, which included a large sum belonging to his employer. He started for the Seine to drown himself. On the way there was a great commotion, caused by the escape of a lion from a strolling menagerie.

People fled in all directions. Instantly the man who was seeking death climbed a lamp post and clung to the top of it, trembling in every limb. When the animal was captured and the danger was over he proceeded to the river and plunged in.
