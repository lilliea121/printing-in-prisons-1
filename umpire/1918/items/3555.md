WASHINGTON

No mists of years can hide him, 
No shadow of the night.
He stands, a glowing vision, 
Upon a sainted height.
A mighty man, a righteous man, 
His name is writ in light.

When ice had locked the valley 
And winds swept to and fro 
And men grew faint with hunger
He knelt in drifted snow, 
This tender man, this loving man, 
And prayed in bitter woe.

His name is shrined by Freedom. 
No name is held more dear.
His glory shines the clearer 
With every passing year—
A sainted fame, a deathless name,
A soul we all revere. 

—W. R. Rose.
