CLAIM VOLCANOES A BLESSING

Even with all their upheavals it would not pay Central America to get rid of her volcanoes if she could, for these upheavals have created the finest coffee and sugar land in the world, notes a correspondent. Usually there are long premonitory warnings and the annual deaths due to this cause are not equal to the number of persons killed yearly in automobile accidents around New York. Neither words nor artist brush could do justice to the wonderful atmospheric effects of the mountain lands. The changing lights and colors, the purple mists, the vast white banks of clouds, the cooling vapors that assume the colors of the rainbow at dawn and sunset, the mirages that throw mountain lakes and lofty peaks in the high heavens, resting, apparently, upon a base of blue ether, all these can never be described or forgotten.
