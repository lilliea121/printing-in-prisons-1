CHINESE BELIEVE IN SEERS

No ene doubts the fortune teller in China. His word is regarded as infallible. When he becomes rich on the offerings of the credulous, the Chinese reader of the future installs himself in luxuricus apartments. There, in a darkened room, the wealthy visit him just as the coolie did on the street.

Even a westerner becomes impressed with the sense of mysticism when he enters one of these chambers. About the wall hang red and black curtains, embroidered with Chinese characters. Strange, hideous faces of bronze idols peer from dim recesses; wavering lights flicker and cast portentous shadows. Spiral rings of incense ascend and evolve into mysterious shapes.

In the center of the room sits the spectacled oracle. Before he talks some one in the distance begins beating tom-toms; there are ghostly cries as he consults the spirits, but as he begins to speak in a monotone other sounds discontinue and one can almost here the knees of the superstitious patrons knocking together in the semidarkness.
