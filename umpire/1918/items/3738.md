WEDNESDAY P. M. BIBLE SCHOOL

The regular meeting of Chaplain Joseph Welch’s Bible School was held on Wednesday afternoon April 3rd. Chaplain Welch gave the boys one of his usual short but pointed addresses, admonishing them to do right. Mr. Frank Dipple, who is always on hand, read the lesson and also gave the boys some good advice and introduced Mr. Arnold Buckley, one of the singers at the Brotherhood Mission, who entertained with two selections. Mr. Dipple brought with him as the afternoon speaker the Rev. William D. McCurdy who is Associate Pastor with Dr. Russell Cohwell at the Baptist Temple of this city. Rev. McCurdy’s eloquent address put him in the first rank among the speakers who have addressed our Bible School and every one present understood and enjoyed his talk, The Chaplain extended to him an invitation to come again and we all say ‘‘Amen’’ to it. The singing of the hymn “Meet me There’’ by the Episcopal Choir was so unusally good, that it was sung the second time with the audience B 7341 assisted the choir with the cornet. —B 7291.
