MOTHER'S FACE Three little lads in converse loud engaged, One sunny summer day, And out of the window low, I thought I'd lean To hear what they might say. "The prettiest thing on earth, I ever saw," One of the wee boys said, "In Grandma's garden was a lovely bird, All yellow, black and red." "The prettiest thing I ever seen on earth," So spoke another lad, "It is a pony at the circus groundsâ€” I want him awful bad!" "I think," the third bright little fellow said, With unaffected grace, "The prettiest thing to me in the world; Is just my mother's face!"
