WHAT WE ARE DOING

Several score Inmates of the E. S. P. are also doing their ‘‘bit,” in so far as it is possible, by the doing of Red Cross work; such as making up bandages, etc. More than a quarter million bandages have been rolled; in excess of 6000 doz. pairs of Socks have been knitted; nearly 1000 bath robes cut out, and some 500 bales of oakum pickt. An appreciable sum of money has been raised among ourselves for the purchase of wool for the making of socks and sweaters, and added to contributions from outside sources. All this in addition to relatively large sums given directly to the Red Cross, Y. M. C. A., Boy Scouts, ete, previous to our War Chest Contribution.

Our work along such lines is only limited by our lack of means, and material; wool, in particular, having become so scarce and high-priced that we are now adding the manufacture of paper vests for our Soldier Boys to our other work. We are forced to look largely to those on the outside who are interested alike in War Work, and our welfare, for aid: and these can literally kill two birds with one stone by helping us to help our Country.
