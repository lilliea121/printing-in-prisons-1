VALE

We regret to chronicle the death on June 4th, of Miss A. M. C. Dupree; the memory of whose gentle presence must long abide with those of our number—and they are many —who were fortunate enough to have met, and known her: a memory fraught with mingled pain and pleasure, pain, that they shall see her face no more; pleasure, that they had known her, and had been made the better men thereby.

It was Miss Dupree who instituted, some thirty years ago, that particular Chapter of the Kings Daughters, whose vocation it is to visit the Prisons, and minister to the unfortunates confined therein, and in this, her life’s work, she was steadfast while health, and strength remained. May her reward be not unworthy of the work that she has done!
