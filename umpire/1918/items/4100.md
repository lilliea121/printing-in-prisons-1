LINES TO SOME YOUTHFUL SINGERS OF ST. JOHN'S ASYLUM CHOIR AUGUST, 4, 1918

O thought that sets the pulse a thrill; 
When, the years of penance done,
We to God’s free air have won, 
Free as any mountain rill,
Leaping, dancing in the sun; 
Careless of the race that’s run;
Glad of the new task begun, 
We shall hear your voices still.

Mary, make us valiant soldiers, 
Help us in the daily fight;
In our struggles with the tempter, 
Help us to discern the right.
To the happy days of childhood, 
We can ne’er win back again;
They are lost and gone forever, 
Mary help us to be men.

Tho our woe were like to Lears; 
And we hear each childish note,
With a tightening on the throat, 
For the burden of the years;
Yet like dancing, golden mote, 
In a sun-beam all a-float;
Like a many coloured coat, 
So the song uplifts and cheers.

In your hands, O Young America, 
Lies the future of the State:
Yours to make it loved of freemen, 
Yours to make it truly great.
In your hearts O Young America, 
Lies your future, hidden deep;
In your choosing, O remember, 
As ye sow, so shall ye reap.
