A DISTINCT LOSS

Recent news reports announce the death of Miss Letha Walls, of Huntington, W. Va., secretary of the Prisoner’s Aid Society, an organization for the help of discharged prisoners.

It is said of Miss Watts that she was indefatigable in her labor for the help of the ex-prisoner, and that she literally sacrificed her life to bring about success in the field of her endeavor. That she should have been called away just at the bloom of womanhood will no doubt seem a great loss to her many friends and relatives, as well as the large number of prisoners to whom she had endeared herself by her incessant labor of love to bring relief and encouragement to the ex-prisoner at the time of greatest need,— the time when he is to face the world in an effort to rehabilitate himself and take a new start in life.
