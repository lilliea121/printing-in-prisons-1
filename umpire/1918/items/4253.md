FRIENDSHIP

He may be all kinds of a liar, 
He may be most kinds of a fool; 
He may be the kind of high flyer, 
That knows neither reason nor rule. T
here may be dark shadows above him,
 Of ruin and woe that impend; 
 I may notrespect - I just love him, 
 Because he’s my friend.

I’m sure he has faults by the billion, 
But I’ll not be casting a stone;
I know that his record’s vermilion, 
-but I know what I know of my own-
He’s always been square with ‘yours truly’, 
Ready to give or to lend;
And I love him, tho wild and unruly,
Because he’s my friend.

I knock him, I know, but I do it,
To his face, and never his back; 
And if other folks knock him, they rue it, 
If I’m near to get in a crack. 
I make no analysis of him, 
I know he’ll ring true at the end; 
I don’t criticise, I just love him,
Because he’s my friend.
