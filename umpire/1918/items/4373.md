Colonel, and the troops went thru their paces to the edification of the visitor, and the admiring spectators; with the Colored Troops carrying off the honors. "Col " Kirby was most pleased to see the interest taken by the men in the soldierly exercise, and in a happy little speech highly complimented them upon their wisdom in undertaking voluntarily a work of much value to themselves, both as regards health, and temperament.
