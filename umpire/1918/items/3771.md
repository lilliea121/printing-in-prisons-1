WAR GARDENS

Speaking of war gardens, they are everywhere, and there are rumors which will not down, that a certain enterprising Inmate, has asked the Warden for the use of the cellars for the growing of mushrooms, and another of equal enterprise is investigating the edibility of water-lily bulbs, with the hope of utilizing the fountain. Inmates are seen hanging parlously from all the eaves, plotting and planning the location of another cucumber bed, or trying to find space for an egg-plant which we personally think preferable to a munition-plant.

Men are handling a spade, who certainly never dug before, and the clean smell of new delved earth is ever in our nostrils, while the question is ever in our ears, “Would you plant Early Rose, or French Fried Potatoes, and how many? and Corn, which do you think the best, White Dent, or Jockey Club, and why?

The amateurs of last year, are the professionals of this, and of all men are the most sought after, for theirs is the wisdom of experience, and they are listened to with deference; and to see one of them ‘‘shoot the sun’’ consult the Almanac to see if the mocn is in the right quarter, and then, with an air of absolute confidence that would make the Kaiser writhe with envy, deposit one small defenceless seed in the gaping earth, generally draws a large, and interested audience,

But we say, more power to their arm, every little bit helps, even the poor little pickle that never reaches maturity, and if by raising a few vegetables we can save a few pounds of our sorely needed wheat, for those who hold the Fighting Line, then let us use every available inch of ground, and despise not blisters and sun-burn, but be happy in the conciousness that we are doing our ‘‘bit’’ for Democracy, and Freedom.
