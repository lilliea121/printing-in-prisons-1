SOME OF STATE'S COUNTY JAILS HAVE NO PRISONERS

Results of the employment of county jail prisoners on farming work in Pennsylvania, as suggested recently by Howard Heinz, State food administrator in a letter to county administrators, to release farmhands eligible for the draft, is shcwn in a. report sent to Mr. Heinz yesterday by the State Board of Charities. A large part of the jail population of fifteen counties of Pennsylvania is now profitably employed in farming and road-building.

In counties where the jails were too far away from farming soil, or the largest fields, jail inmates have been employed at street cleaning, carpet weaving and in useful occupations about public buildings. The progress of the plan developed that there are eounty jails in Pennsylvania with no prisoners.
