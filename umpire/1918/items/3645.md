GREAT FROST DEPTH IN ALASKA

The great depth of permanently frozen soil in polar and subpolar regions is a subject of perennial interest, concerning which few data are available. In numerous excavations made in placer mining in Alaska the ground is permanently frozen to depths, beginning eighteen inches or two feetbelow the surface.

In the Klondike, according to the Geological Magazine, the alluvium is frozen to a depth of about two hundred feet. At Fairbanks permanent ground frost has been found at many places to a depth of more than two hundred feet, and the deepest shaft there penetrated 318 feet of frozen alluvium. In Seward Peninsula many holes in permanently frozen alluvium are more than seventy-five feet deep and one is nearly 200 feet deep.

On the other hand, some ground in this region is not frozen, for reasons not under- stood. According to Dr. A. H. Brooks, when the moss is stripped from the soil the ground thaws, and with open cut mining or cultivation the upper level of permanent ground frost seems gradually todescend. It is therefore believed that this ground frost is a survival of a climate colder than the present one and is preserved by the nonconducting mat of moss and other vegetation.
