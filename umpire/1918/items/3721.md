ANTI-LOAFING LEGISLATION

A correspondent writes that New York state has followed New Jersey in the introduction of anti-loafing legislation that is designed to utilize the full man power of the State and at the same time rid the community of a worthless element in its composition.

The bill is said to provide that all able bodied men between the ages of 18 and 50, be employed at some useful cccupation. The jobless must register at the agencies of the State Industrial Commission, and power is vested in sheriffs and police officers to arrest unemployed men not so registered.

There is some doubt just how the law would work out in actual operation. A wide difference of opinion is bound to ensue on what may be a ‘‘useful occupation.” Furthermore, the class of men who would habitually loaf during a national crisis like the present would, perhaps, as soon go to jail as not. Care would also have to be taken to prevent the abuse of the proposed law by draft dodgers.

At any rate, cessation of immigration, the migration of alien reservists and the enlistment of thousands of New York boys make it a moral, if not a legal offence, for a man who can work, to be idle now.
