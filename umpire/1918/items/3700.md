A FEW HOURS FLIGHT

With the development of the aeroplane a way out has been found for the holiday-minded person who objects to our still having most week-days also work-days. Chasing spring used to be a favorite amusement of railroad age. You started with orange blossoms in Cuba and gradually followed Prima Vera northward to the ice-violet of North Pole and then made a long jump down the other side to North Africa, where the spring cactus was just about to flame more on the Libyan sand dunes. Now with 200-miles-an-hour aeroplane speed, a chap could get to a place where there is a holiday every day, if he were willing to travel nights.
