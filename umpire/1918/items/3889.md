A WORKERS CREED

Charlotte Perkine Gilman

To keep my health! 
To do my work! 
To live! 
Never to look behind me for an hour! 
To see to it I grow and gain and give! 
To wait in weakness, and to walk in power, 
But always fronting forward to the light, 
Always, and always facing toward to right. 
Robbed, starved, defeated, fallen, wide astray â€” 
On, with what strength I have! 
Back to the way!
