William Tyler Page has given us: this. "The American Creed.," I believe in the United States of America as a Government of the people, by the people, for the people; whose just powers are derived from the consent of the governed; a democracy in a republic; a sovereign nation of many sovereign states; a perfect union, one and inseparable, established upon those principles of Freedom, Equality, Justice, and Humanity of which the American Patriots sacrificed their lives and fortunes. I therefore believe it my duty to my country to love it; to support its Constitution; to obey its Laws; to respect its Flag; and to defend it against all enemies.
