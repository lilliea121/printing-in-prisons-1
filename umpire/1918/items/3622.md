RABBITS AND HARES

All of the domestic varieties of rabbits, except the Belgian hare, are descendants of the burrowing rabbits of the Old World, and the big European hare, almost as large as our western jackrabbit, is the ancestor of the so called Belgian form, which is now so popular as a domestic animal of profit and is becoming more so, observes an exchange.

In the Northern hemisphere of the New World we have many more species of hares than the Old World can boast of, as the cottontail, the Southern swamp hare, the Arctic hare or snow-shoe rabbit and two species of of Western jackrabbits or giant hares. Yet we have not successfully domesticated one of these forms, though this might be done as a matter of profit in the production of meat.
