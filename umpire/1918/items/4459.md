A WORD TO THE WISE It is suggested to the men who have novelties for sale, that they price their wares as low as possible. Several criticisms have been heard in regard to the absurdly high valuation placed upon some articles manufactured by them, and sales have been lost in consequence. Remember, it is "demand" which regulates the values, and be prepared to meet it, rather than hold your stock.
