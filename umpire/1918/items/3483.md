KEEP ON TRYING

Do you remember when you learned to swim, or ride a bicycle? You went to it for all you were worth, but you couldn’t get the hang of it. Then, a few days afterward, you tried again and it ‘‘came to you’’ first thing.

But it wouldn’t have ‘‘come to you’’ if you hadn’t ‘‘gone to it’’ that other time. The effort which seemed to be wasted at the time you made it wasn’t wasted after all. You will find it the same with learning how to think. If you can’t keep your mind on the subject tomorrow morning, keep on trying till the half hour is up. The next morning you’ll do a little better, and you’ll surprise yourself within a few weeks.
