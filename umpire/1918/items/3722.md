CANADA TO ENLIST EX-PRISONERS

It is proposed to organize a regiment of ex-prisoners from all parts of Canada at an early date, says a writer in a Montreal paper.

The writer advocated service in the army or navy for prisoners. He asserted that under the present plan the prisoners are a great economic loss to the taxpayers In France and Canada, said the speaker, convicts have been allowed to fight for their country.

“This war will have a demoralizing effect on them,’’ he said. ‘‘After it is over there will be more crime than ever, and we must prepare a more adequate penal system.’’
