A witty social worker once described the correctional institutions of a certain great city as "workhouses where nobody works, penitentiaries where no one repents, and reformatories where no one is reformed." Such sweeping judgments can now be truthfully passed on the penal institutions of very few states. Steadily the idea – and it is a fundamentally Christian idea – is growing that the average inmate of a jail can be so dealt with that upon his release he can resume his place in society and be counted as an asset instead of a liability.
