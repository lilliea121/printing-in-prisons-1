CAMP GRANT. ILLINOIS Oct. 10, 1918.

Inmate B 9152,
Philadelphia, Pa.,

Dear Sir:

Thank you for the game boards "Go Bang" which you have kindly donated for the use of the soldiers.

We have placed one in our K. of C. build- ing No. 1, and another in No. 2, while we have already built 4 club houses and are planning on 4 more. \

Camp Grant at present has about 30,000 white and 10,000 colored troops and is used as a replacement depot for divisions going a- Cross. :

Such acts as yours help the fighting boys in that they see evidence that you men are behind them, helping in every way possible,

With best wishes for your success, I again thank you.

Yours very truly, 
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS
