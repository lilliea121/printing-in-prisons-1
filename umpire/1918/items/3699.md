THE CITY OF FEZ

In its externals Fez is a clean and attractive city, as oriental cities go, which is not saying that an American city health officer would not curl up and die of despair in some of its noisome alleys, a writer states. The new city is surrounded by a battlemented wall and most of the houses are white-washed to a dazzling brilliance. There are no vacant spaces along the closely built streets, and this, along with the encircling wall, gives the city a definite and finished appearance which an unwalled town can never acquire. The streets are roofed with trellis work curtained by climbing vines, so that a greenish ght flecked by dancing spots of gold plays over the white robes and the red head-dresses of the people.
