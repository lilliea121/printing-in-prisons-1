ORDERS TO ENFORCE RULE

It is announced that State Food Administrators were ordered to enforce strictly the Food Administration’s rule requiring bakers to use 20 per cent. of wheat flour substitutes in all bakery products by February 24.

“This rule,” a telegram sent to the administrators said, ‘‘is an important link in the Food Administration’s wheat conservation program, upon the success of which depends our ability to supply the Allies with the wheat flour that is essential to their victory and ours. The list of substitutes 1is wide.”

From now until the war is over people must be contented to appease their hunger in part with war bread.
