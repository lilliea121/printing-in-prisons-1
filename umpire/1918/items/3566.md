BOY SCOUTS IN THE PHILIPPINES

It was recently announced that young Filipino boys, khaki-clad, with their honorary silk handkerchiefs and other emblems of achievement, will soon be learning to march, to make camp, to wigwag and ‘“to do one good deed a day.” For their is to be an army of Filipino Boy Scouts. Hadji Butu, the first and only Moro member of the Philippine Upper House, thought it was high time the Philippine Islands fell into line with their Far Eastern neighbors and matched the very capable companies of young Chinese, Sikhs and Japanese whose manouveres seem to find a ready space in the public prints the world over. Senator Hadji Butu thinks also that military training in the schools ought to be cumpulsory, and his bill provides for this addition to the curriculum,

The Moro Senator’s bill provides in every way for the formation of Boy Scout companies, for the training of instructors and for the co-operation of the Philippine Constabulary or National Guard, and no doubt is felt that it will become a law by unanimous consent. It is hoped that Miss Filipino’s problems will shortly be settled as satisfactorily in the formation of organizations of Girl Scouts.
