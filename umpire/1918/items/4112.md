TO- - - - J. 

O how love I thy law ! it is my all the day.
Thou, through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies: for they are ever with me.
I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.
I understand more than the ancients, cause I keep Thy prccepts.
I have refrained my feet from every evi] way, that I might keep thy word.
I have not departed from thy judgements; for thou hast taught me.
How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate every false way.
