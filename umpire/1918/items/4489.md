The beautiful picture of Christmastide, drawn by our friend Rev. Thomas Latimer, which we present, reminds us of our duty towards the many who in the passing year have so faithfully labored for our welfare. May it long live in our hearts and lead us to accept to the full its interpretation of a Christmas and Better New Year.
