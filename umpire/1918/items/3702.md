CALLS ALASKA WOMEN PRETTY

A traveler returning from the Yukon, remarked about the good locks of Alaska women, and the fact that they dress with becoming taste. Of course, our northern women are pretty. Why shouldnâ€™t they be?

They enjoy absolutely pure air, drink water as fresh as that from a mountain spring, get plenty of exercise, and take an active part in community affairs. They are cosmopolitan the same as the men are, and well read and well informed. As every one knows, there is nothing so beautiful as good health. It is a joy even to see an Alaskan girl swinging along with a free, firm tread instead of the mincing step of her sister in the states, who gives the impression she is stepping on eggs.

The Alaska girl looks you squarely in the eye, gives you a frank handclasp and is sure of herself at all times.
