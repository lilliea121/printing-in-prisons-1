NOTES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE PARDON OF MEN IN PRISON, WHO MAY BE FOUND QUALIFIED FOR MILITARY SERVICE, AND DESIRE TO ENLIST FOR THE SAME, UNDER THE UNITED STATES OR THEIR ALLIES.

1. There are now 1400 male prisoners in the Eastern State Penitentiary, of normal, physical and mental condition.

2. Many of them have expressed a desire to enter military service of the Nation at once.

3. It is the judgement of those in constant contact, and personal association with them, that if a Pardon should be granted it would be vindicated by the men.

4. The course now pursued in Parole would afford a safe method of proceedure.

5. 200 men are now under drill in elementary tactics, preparatory to company formation.
