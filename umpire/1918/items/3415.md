INSECTS SPREAD DISEASE

Dr. L. O. Howard, chief of the federal bureau of entomology, declared recently that no fewer than 226 diseases are spread directly or indirectly through the agency of insects, and that 282 species of insects are guilty of some form of the deadly work.

This bears out the scientific contention that insects are the only dangerous rivals of man for mastery of the earth, says an exchange. The present has been called the age of man and insects; and the battle for supremacy has not yet been fought to a finish. Man is increasing from century to century, but the insects are, too.
