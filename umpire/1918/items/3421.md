A FEAT OF ENGINEERING SKILL,

One of the strangest and most difficult engineering tasks that have been attempted in a long time will be the removal of a granite pyramid erected forty years ago at the top of Sherman pass in the Rocky Mountains. This pyramid is to be moved five miles and set in place again. It is sixty feet high and sixty feet square at the base. The pyramid is unique among monuments. It stands on one of the most lofty eminences ever chosen for such a purpose, some 8,000 feet above sea level, and commemerates the names of Oliver and Oakes Ames, the men whose constructive genius made it possible to build the first railroad across the Rocky Mountains.
