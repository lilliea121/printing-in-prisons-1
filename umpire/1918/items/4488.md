Oh, do not pray for easy lives! Pray to be stronger men! Do not pray for tasks equal to your powers, Pray for powers equal to your tasks! Then the doing of your work shall be no miracle, But you shall be the miracle. Every day you shall wonder at yourself, At the richness of life which has come you by the Grace of God. --Phillips Brooks
