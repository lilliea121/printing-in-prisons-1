E. S. P. LEAGUE HOLDS MEETING

A meeting of the E. S. P. B. B. League was held on the 25th, for the parpose ot electing a President, vice B 7664 resigned. The meeting was called to order by B 7612 Secretary, who called upon the retiring President to say a few words. ‘‘Jake’’ gave as his reason for resigning the fact that he liked the playing end of the game better than the executive end of it. His resignation was duly accepted, and a vote of thanks given him for his services to the League.

B 8361, Curly, was then nominated to fill the vacancy, and elected by acclamation. Curly stated in his little speech of acceptance, that he was heart and soul for. the game, and would help out in every possible way. A truth which he at once proceeded to prove by purchasing a supply of gloves and bats etc. for the use of the League. He said that everyone could depend upon him for a square deal, and all present showed their belief in this statement, by giving him a rousing vote of confidence.

Why don’t some of our ‘‘retired’’ business men help out their favorite team by buying a glove or a bat or a half dozen balls for it? And another thing, don't knock the players, boost them.
