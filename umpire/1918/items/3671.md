YOUR HEAD NOT AN ORNAMENT

“You all know that every man has a head topside his neck. This head was not put there by accident, nor as ornamental bric-a-brac,’’ says a well known writer. ‘‘Of course, the head, being equipped with a face, is useful as a means of identification, but if that was all it was good for what would be the use of identifying you? Nobody would care a rap whether you were Pete or Jim or the kid that lives over the bakery.

“The real purpose of the head is to be a packing case for the brain, and the brain is a machine for the manufacture of thoughts.

“So you want to learn how torun it and how to keep it clean and well oiled. You want to learn how to use it, no matter what comes up—in an emergency just as well as in a contest to guess how many beans there are in a jar. There’s a heap of difference between thinking and the sort of product a lot of folks’ brains turn cut. One brain that can think is worth a hundred arms strong enough to lift a heifer. That’s why a general is more valuable than a great many thousands of soldiers, each one of whom could probably lick him beautifully in a fist fight. It’s because he can think.”
