THE E. S. P. BREAKS A RECORD

A majority of the Inmates of the E. S. P. are bankrupt today yet never felt better in their lives, for they have learned the joy that lies in giving; the pleasures of sacri- fice, and one that can extend more real happi- ness from doing the unselfish thing than most people exist. We would like to shoulder a gun and fight for our country; we would like equally well to work for it, but as it seems that we can do neither as yet, we are trying to do what we can while we await that long delayed chance for real service.

We have bought Bonds and Stamps, given liberally to Red Cross; Y. M. C. A; Boy Scouts, and nearly $4000. to the War Chest. We have rolled bandages, picked oakum knitted socks, ete., tried in many ways to serve, but it remained for us to cap the cli- max of our giving, and establish, so far as we are aware, a precedent for the other In- stitutions of like character, by our deed of Saturday last, when we gave in less than three hours the sum of $1600 for the pur- chase of an Ambulance and equipment, as our gift to the boys who fight our battles; and we liked the doing of it so well, that after we get our financial breath back we’re likely to give another.

We don’t know in whose brain the idea originated; perhaps it just grew, but when ‘“Col. Jake,”” B 9131 put the matter up to Warden Robert J. McKenty on a day last week, he gave it his heartiest approval and support and told Jake to go ahead, and do his best or ‘“‘worst.’’ It was decided tlatit should be given the most representative character, and a Committee of Seventeen, one man from each Block and Gallery was selected to manage it.

The ladies of the Second Block were given the first chance at the Collection Plate, and responded magnificently. If the whole In- stitution had done as well, we could have bought five Ambulances. Jake went over prepared to talk, but the Warden had no more than explained the purpose of their coming when someone said ‘“‘Twenty-five dollars’’ ina loud tone of voice, and leftJake speechless. They gave a total of $121.50, or an average of more than five dollars each, which goes far toward convincing us that the female of the speciesis a better fighter than the Male, else why so anxious to finance a fight?

drive a parade was quickly made up and a prideful column, with the Warden as Grand Marshal, and the Band blaring it’s loudest, wound twice about the Institution, and then on returning to the home grounds, at the Warden’s suggestien sang The Star Spangled Banner as a fitting conclusion to a ‘‘Perfect Day.”’
