“BILLY” McKENTY QUITS THE PHILLIES

Trades His Bat for a Gun and Will Shoot-em at the Kaiser

Although he has hud several fine offers to play in the big show, Bill McKenty who first started baseball heaving them up for the old Ninth Block team, has decided to quit the skinned diamond for the steel deck of a dreadnaught and shoot-em at Kaiser Bill, instead of over the plate.

“Bill” as he is better known in the E.S.P. League, went south with the Phillies on their spring training trip and was to have been seasoned with a year in the Minor Leagues, but he decided he would be of more use in the Navy than on a ballfield and has shaped his career accordingly. He also received several glittering offers from the “A’s’’ and the Strawbridge team, but all their promise of gold and glory could not tempt Bill from helping his ‘“Uncle Sammy’’ in his hour of need.
