MAKING FIRE WITH ICE

Take a smooth, clear, curving piece of ice, one not too thick, and hold it in the rays of the sun so that it will bring the light to a sharp focus just as will a lens in a reading glass. The ice will not last long enough to burn a piece of paper, but if the focus rests on a speck of gun cotton it will cause combustion and a flame will result. Arctic explorers have built fires often with this expedient when matches were absent and flint and rock not handy.
