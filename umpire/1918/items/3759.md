LET’S ALL BE AMERICANS NOW

News despatches tell us that Pershing’s Boys are ‘‘going in;’’ are opposing their efforts; giving their lives to stem the gray tide flooding toward Paris, and which threat- ens to overwhelm the world; and we rebel at the thought that we must stand on the sidelines, watching in price, and sorrow and a real envy, while friend, or relative make the last supreme sacriflce. Such sacrifice as we would gladly make, had we not long ago forfeited the right, and can only ask that we be allowed the privilege of offering our lives upon the altar of our country.

We can, as yet, do little that will be of material assistance; can but make such contribution as our small means will allow; regard as a veritable labor of love, the little tasks assigned us; and never cease our knoccking at the door of opportunity; but we can,at least, all be Americans, in all that the name implies. Americans, in cheerful acceptance of the little sacrifices that we must make; Americans, in facing the inevitably increasing hardships of our lot, without whine, or murmur. Let’s all be Americans now!
