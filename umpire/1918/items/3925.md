AN OUTSIDE APPRECIATION

The Stroudsburg Times-Democrat, reprints the recent Resolution of the Honor and Friendship Club, subscribing Ten Dollars Monthly to the War Chest Fund, and comments on it as follows:-

Here is an inspiration, indeed, Deprived of their own liberty by their past follies, they still love their country and give, that others may enjoy what is forever denied to them. This is the kind of giving that has been awakened all over the land by the Red Cross and it is the kind of giving that will not stop until all visions of a Hunnish America have forever vanished.
