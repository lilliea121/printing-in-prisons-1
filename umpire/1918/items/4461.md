TWO SOCIALISTS According to the papers our one-time friend Mr. Kerensky will eat his Christmas dinner in the Winter Palace in Petrograd, where he for the last couple of months has made himself quite at home, sleeping in the Czar's bed, bathing in his massive gold bathtub, wearing Imperial crown monogramed smoking jackets, and "dreaming" away his idle hours in the throne chair. He may be a Socialist at heart, but like any other human being he likes the comforts of a royal palace as much as the next one. And over in Potsdam Herr Liebknecht does the same thing, thus proving to the world that man is vane by nature and that his antagonism to capital is based on the same logic that compelled the fox to leave the grapes alone.
