A GOOD WILL OFFERING

Mr Yarnall, Overseer 9th Block, is seriously ill, and the men of the Block recently clubbed together, and sent him an offering of flowers as an earnest of their hope for his speedy recovery. Appended is a word of acknowledgment, and applleciation.

Dear Boys:

I want to extend my thanks for the beautiful flowers you so kindly sent Mr. Yarnall today, they are wonderful.

I canâ€™t tell you how much he appreciated them. He was deeply touched to know you were thinking so much of him, but worried for fear you had spent all your money.

I am trusting in God to bring him back to good health to be with you all again.

Thanking you again, I am,

Sincerely,

LYDIA E. YARNALL
