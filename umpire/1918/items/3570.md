THE BETTER WAY

I ask not wealth, but power to take 
And use the things I have aright; 
Not years, but wisdom that shall make 
My life a profit and delight. 
I ask not that for me the plan 
Of good and ill be set aside; 
But that the common lot of man 
Be noble borne, and glorified. 
I know I may not always keep 
My steps in places green and sweet, 
Nor find the pathway of the deep 
A place of safety for my feet; 
But pray, that when the tempter’s breath 
Shall fiercely sweep my way about, 
I make not shipwreck of my faith 
In the unbottomed sea of doubt; 
And that, though it be mine to know 
How hard the stoniest pillow seems, 
Good angels still may come and go 
About the places of my dreams. 
I do not ask for love below, 
That friends shall never be estranged; 
But for the power of loving, so 
My heart may keep its youth unchanged. 

—Phoebe Cary.
