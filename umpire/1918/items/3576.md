HOW ALASKA WAS NAMED

The name Alaska is said to have been given to the whole of that territory by the Russian traders who first reached the island of Unlashka, on the authority of the natives, who declared that to the eastward there was a great land or territory which was called Alayeska. From this the present name of Alaska is derived.
