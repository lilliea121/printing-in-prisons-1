GOOD OMEN OR ILL?

It is said Gov. Brumbaugh will take up at once the question of placing all abled-bodied prisoners at work on State highways. An Act of 1917 gives authority, but the Governor apparently is not clear about the method of procedureâ€”a fix the many County Commissioners also seem to be in. He has asked Attorney-General Brown for an opinion, and this will be sent broad-cast throughout the State.
