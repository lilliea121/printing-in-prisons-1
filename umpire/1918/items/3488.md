ALASKAâ€™S MINERAL WEALTH

It is estimated that Alaska produced $14,760,000 worth of minerals in the year of1917. These are the figures issued by the United States Geological Survey, Department of the Interior, and are based on estimates made by G. C. Martin. The value of the mineral output of Alaska in 1917, although about $6,870,000 less than in 1916, was greater than in any other year. The most valuable mineral product in 1917 was copper, of which 88,200,000 pounds, valued at $24,000,000, was produced. This is less than the output of 1916, which was 119,600,000 pounds, valued at $29,480,000, but is greater than that of any other year. The reduction is due largely to labor troubles, and is not necessarily permanent. The gold produced in 1917, $15,450,000 of which $9,850,000 was derived from placer mines, was also less than that produced in 1916, which was $17,240,000, and is the smallest since 1904. The reduction was due chiefly to curtailment of operations because of the scarcity of labor and the high cost of materials, but in part to the disaster at the Treadwell mine and the depletion of some of the richer placers.

During the year Alaska also produced silver valued at $1,050,000, coal value at $300,000, lead valued at $160,000, tin valued at $160,000, antimony valued at $40,000, and tungsten, chromium, petroleum, marble, gypsum, graphite and platinum valued at $600,000. During thirty-three years of mining Alaska has produced more than $391,000,000 in zold, silver, copper andother minerals. Of this amount $293,000,000 represents the value of the gold, and $88,200,000 that of copper.
