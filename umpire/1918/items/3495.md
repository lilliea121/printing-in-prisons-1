THEIR FIRST APPLE TREE

Romance clings to the first apple tree of the Northwest, still standing in Vancouver Barracks, in the State of Washington. The American Forestry Magazine cites historical authority from London nearly 100 years ago.

At a lunch party in London about 1825, given in honor of some young gentlemen who were about to embark for Fort Vancouver, in the employ of the Hudson Bay Company, seeds of the fruit eaten were slyly slipped by some young ladies into the waistcoat pockets of the young men, and upon their arrival at their destination the young men, in overhauling their wardrobes, discovered the seeds and gave them to Bruce, the gardener at the fort.

Ii is said that the seeds planted by the gardener, Bruce, produced several trees, three of which lived for a long time, and were pointed out as the only apple trees in the Northwest. In the course of time two ot them disappeared, leaving the present tree alone. Even the existence of this tree seems to have been almost entirely forgotten by the general public, not even the commander of the barracks knowing that such a tree stood on the ground which he controlled.
