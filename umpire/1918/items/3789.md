WE BEAR THINGS LIKE THIS

Our neighbor scrubbed the floor last night, 
And we stood by, aghast;
For strange, wild words went whirling by, 
Like leaves before the blast—
With dashes, blanks, and asterisks, 
We’ll now fill up this verse;
For not even by proxy, 
Will we be known to curse.—

We knew the moment when he stuck, 
A splinter in his thumb;
We knew the very word he said;
—No, it was not ‘‘By gum!—
And when he stept upon the soap, 
And nigh went through the door;
We knew just what had happened, 
By the volume of his roar.

We’ve heard Vesuvius erupt, 
And trembled at the sound; 
We’ve listened to Niagara’s roar, 
Till every sense was drowned: 
But friends, last night we heard some sounds, 
We never heard before, 
The biggest noise on earth, is when, 
Our neighbor scrubs the floor.
