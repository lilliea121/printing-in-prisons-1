GOVERNMENT CALLS FOR MORE WOOL

From the appeal of the United States Department of Agriculture to the farmers to raise more sheep, we gather the fact that the amount of wool needed for clothing and outfitting our armies will exceed the entire wool production of the United States. In the last three years the total number of sheep in the country has decreased 1,200,000, and the wool yield bhas fallen off nearly 5,000, 000 pounds. In 1916 the amount of wool produced was barely 39 per cent. of that manufactured, and the deficiency is fast becoming greater as the needs of our fighting men increase. It should never be made up freely of shoddy for uniforms and blankets. The Senate Com nittee on Military Affairs has shown how keen unscrupulous dealers are to trick the Government. Quartermaster-generals swathed in red tape are no match for them.

Six out of seven farms in thiscountry raise no sheep. The Government urges the farmers to lend their aid in the pressing emergency. Every one of them who raises twenty sheep provides the wool for one soldierâ€™s apparel. As they have fed the American armies, they must do their utmost also to clothe them.
