CLEANINC A BATTLESHIP

One of our big warships was brought into dock the other day for a cleaning. Two hundred men worked all day scraping off 600 tons of animal and plant growth from its sides and bottom. This tremendous quantity of sea life had accumulated in less than two years, during which time the ship had traveled many thousand miles. The weight of barnacles was so great that from 25 to 40 per cent more coal was consumed in maintaining the normal speed of the boat.
