WAR WORK FACTOR IN UNITING ALL CREEDS

From Camp Dix, Wrightstown, N. J., a correspondent writes that the world war is sure to effect tremendous changes in politics, economics, society, but in the light of the last weekâ€™s evert here, there is evidence that one of its most epoch-making reactions will be its effect vpon the religious world. Protestants, Catholics, Jews, all came into the training camps with their organizations for making moie pleasant the life of the soldiers. They may or may not have had ideas of devoting their efforts chiefly to men of their own creeds. But they had not been here a month before they discovered the job was too big for them and denominational divisions and lip-service fer men of all creeds turned to whole-hearted and open-handed worked for and among men of all creeds and non-creeds.
