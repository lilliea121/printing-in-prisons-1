BROTHERHOOD

O brothers, we are children of the sons of man,
Valiant, fearful, haughty, tearful, clinging close to class or clan, 
Split in sordid, narrow nations, caught in creeds that bless or ban, 
But brothers, we are brothers of the sons of man.

O brothers, we are children of the sons of man, 
With step elate the millions march upon the battle van; 
They die like sheep in shambles(dear God, send peace again,) 
O brothers, are we brothers of the sons of men? 

The fleets of air that journey fair, on joyous mission bent, 
Now fling their death darts flaming from the fiery firmament; 
Where soft the ocean billows breathe, where the breakers swell, 
Squat on their hips, the battleships are baying hounds of hell.

O brothers, ’tis the mothers who are martyred at the guns, 
Europe’s soul is stricken with the slaughter of her sons, 
The great world heart is heavy (dear God, send peace again,) 
And brothers still be brothers of the sons of men.

— Robert Loveman.
