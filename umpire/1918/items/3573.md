A TOUGH WOOD

One of the toughest of woods is that of the so-called Osage orange, which, however, is not an orange at all, but belongs to the nettle family. Some idea of its strenght may be had from areport made not long ago by the forest service, which shows that a block 30 inches long and two inches by two inches in cross section, when bent, breaks under a stress of 13,666 pounds.
