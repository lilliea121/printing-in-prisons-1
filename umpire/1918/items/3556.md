SOLDIER-AUTHOR SAYS WAR MAKES MEN BETTER

In a talk at the monthly meeting of the Booksellers Association of Philadelphia, at the Franklin Inn Club, recently, Corporal R. Derby Holmes, a native of Boston, who fought with the British army at the Somme and is the author of the book ‘‘A Yankee in the Trenches,’’ declared that war is not all horror, but contains a good deal of fun for the soldiers, both in and out of the trenches.

‘‘In the trenches and under fire, all that is bad in a man disappears and is forgotten. If in the past he has been a thief, a thug or a scoundrel, he loses all trace of those characters and the best in him comes to the surface and is lighted up by heroism and sacrifice. I believe that every man comes back from war a better and more magnanimous human being.”
