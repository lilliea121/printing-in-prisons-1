SEVEN JOBS AND READY EXCUSE

A local report is to the effect that a prisoner named Meyer Frank, of New York city, appeared before United States Commissioner Edmunds to answer a charge of defrauding the Government out of $500 in attempting to hold seven positions at the Hog Island ship-building plant and collecting the money.

In his testimony before Commissioner Edmunds Frank said that when he signed the alleged confession it was because he wanted his handcuffs taken off, as they hurt him.

He testified that he had asked Paul Brown, of the Hog Island Secret Service Bureau, to take them off and that Brown had refused unless he would sign the confession.

Commissioner Edmunds refused to consider the confession and held him under $750 bail for a hearing before the United States District Court in March.
