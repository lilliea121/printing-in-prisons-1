EVERYBODY ROOT FOR THIS

There is hope of a Bill being presented to the Legislature at its next session, which will provide for the giving of conditional Pardons, to those deemed worthy of a slightly qualified freedom—a sort of glorified parole.

This promises to give those unfortunates whose minimun sentence treads too closely upon the heels of their maximum; as well as those who are ‘‘doing it all,” a chance to prove in comparative freedom that their good behavior here, was not the merest “camouflage,’’ but the real beginning of a new life. There are many Inmates wi hin these walls who would gladly embrace the opportunity of Service, and rehabilitation offered them, and are only prevented fiom doing so, by an antiquated system, ard a foolish precedent. We can understand the Board’s not wishing to entirely condone the faults of some; to keep a string tied to tiem, as it were; but we feel that there’s mary a man here, hopelessly ‘‘buried” with a long “bit,” who could “make good’’ under the present urge were the chance given him; and here promises to be an opportunity. Here’s hoping.
