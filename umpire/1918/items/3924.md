BEWARE, WILLTAM, QF CURLY’S ¢“TROOPS.”

The Warden reviewed Curly’s ‘‘troops,” Wednesday morning, behind the 11th Block and expressed his pleasure at the measure of preparedness shown. He made a little speech to the potential warriors after the Company had ‘‘fallen’” into line, which should be of priceless value to Curly as a recruiting agency, in “which he assured the “boys’’ that they were doing the wise, and manly thing, for none knew but that a U- boat might some day come sneaking up the Schuylkill and drop a shell into the Soup- wagon, or an aerial raider drop a bomb into our War-gardens, and forever destroy their usefulness, for the Warden assured us that after our War Chest Contribution the Huns couldn’t possibly regard us as other than combatants, That we must be ready to risk our lives at any moment for these our most precious possessions. He said that it has been his fortune to be present at Atlantic City on the previous day, and witness ihe landing of s boat-load of refugees from one of the torpedoed ships, and spoke of the dire plight of the women and childien therein, and said that he would have liked nothing better than to have come to close quarters with a bunch of Huns about then. There’s nothing of the Pacifist about the "Boss.”
