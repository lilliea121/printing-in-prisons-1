DAKOTA PRISONERS WORK OUTSIDE

Through the personal efforts of Peter Norbeck, Governor of South Dakota, a number of the convicts in the Sioux Falls penitentiary are being given useful employment outside the prison walls.

The prisoners have been sent across the State to the Black Hills, where their services are being utilized in beautifying a State game preserve which is situated in the most romantic and most picturesque portion of the Black Hills. â€˜

From the State they receive extra remuneration and are temporarily given their freedom for this work of honor, and thus far none of them has given the least sign that the conditions of the semi-liberty will be violated. The convicts are being employed in the construction of roads through the game preserve and in the erection of buildings and the making of other improvements in the preserve. Plans for the improvements were made in advance of the commencement of the work, the intention being to make the State game preserve one of the finest parks in the West. The automobile roads and other highways through the preserve will be among the best in South Dakota and adjoining States.
