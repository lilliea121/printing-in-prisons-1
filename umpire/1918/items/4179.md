LIBRARY NOTICE

About 500 new books have been added to our Library this year, and compiled into a new supplement, which will be delivered to every cell during this week. In order that all may have a chance at these books, only one will be given with each slate if requested for; therefore put down on your slate selections from the old catalog also. 

Abel Schall Jr.
Librarian
