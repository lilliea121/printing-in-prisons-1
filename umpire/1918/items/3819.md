WEDNESDAY P. M. BIBLE SCHOOL

A very pleasant hour was spent on Wednesday afternoon May 1st by those privileged to attend the meeting of Chaplain Welch’s Bible School. Good singing and speaking were the features of the afternoon. Chaplain Welch, who was absent the previous week buying Liberty Bonds for some of the ‘‘boys,” was on hand and delivered a short address. He said he wished he could only buy some of us our liberty as easily as he could buy bonds. Mr. Dipple conducted the responsive reading of the day lesson, Mark 9-30 to 50 "Jesus Rebuking Selfishness.” Mr. Dipple had Rev. D. B. Goff Jr., Evangelist of the Phila. M.E. Conference as the speaker for the afternoon. Rev. Goff’s talk was a treat, he is a forceful speaker. Rev. Goff was accompanied by his wife. Mr. Dipple closed the meeting with a short talk and prayer.
