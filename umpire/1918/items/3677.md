CAN YOU MAKElA SAPLIN VISE?

It’s easy enough if you know how, says a woodsman. In order to make a vise in the woods, cut a good-sized hardwood sapling, leaving a square-topped stump of convenient height. Split the stump through the middle as far as necessary. Trim the upper part, if needed for the purpose. Then, about 18 inches from the top, lash the stump firmly with a rope and twist it tight with a stick, like a tourniquet. Open the split with wedges, insert the article to be held, knock out the wedges, and—there you are.
