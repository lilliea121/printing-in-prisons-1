THE 23d PSALM, As revised by us.

The war is my aim; I shall not rest.

Until Uncle Sam he maketh me to lie down upon a firing-step, and leadeth me over tke

Rhine.

And restoreth my manhood, and leusdeth me in the path of glory for my soul’s sake. . Yea, tho 1 walk in No Man’s Land in the midnight hours, I will fear ‘no Boche; being Uncle Sam’ soldier: whose unifan zrc whose gun will comfort me.

Let me but eat Uncle Sam’s rations in the presence of the Hun, and adorn my head ;viltlh a helmet, and, lo, my cup of joy will be full.

Surely then will I remember his justice, and his mercy all the days of my life, and I will be a good soldier, and citizen forever.
