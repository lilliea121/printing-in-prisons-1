SEA BARGES COMING BACK

Byston news reports state that the old wooden barge, the Ox of the Sea, long deprived of glory, has come into its own in these war-time days of fuel shortage. Many of the swift, white-winged schooners which supplanted it for the most part have been lost in storms or sunk by German submarines. The few that remain have been pressed into other service, as have many of the iron steamers built to bring coal from Southern ports to New England.

With the coming of the crisis in the fuel situation the utility of the dumpy, slow-going craft, strung out in tows of two, three, or more in the leash of a powerful little tug, again was recognized.
