THE HEART OF AN IRISH LAD The minstrel boy to the war has gone, In the ranks of death you'll find him; His father's sword he has girded on, And his wild harp slung behind him. "Land of Song" said the warrior bard, "Though all the world betrays thee; One word, at least, thy rights shall guard, One faithful harp shall praise thee." The minstrel fell, but the foeman's chains Could not bring his proud soul under; The harp he loved ne'er spoke again, For he tore its chords asunder; And said! "No chains shall sully thee, Thou soul of love and bravery! Thy songs were made for the pure and free, They shall never sound in slavery!"
