THE SONG SERVICE

The monthly service given on the centre by the E.S.P. choir and orchestra onSunday last was marked by several features of unusual excellence; notably - the singing of Mr. Wilbur Herwig, wlo intrccuvced Ly Warden McKenty, as an artist of superior ability, fully justified the Wardenâ€™s assertion by his rendering of the hymns "Rock of Ages." and "Come Home." 

Our own boys acquitted themselves very well indeed as was evidenced by the hearty applause that rewarded their efforts.
