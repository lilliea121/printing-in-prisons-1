NOW AND THEN

In order adequately to measure the depth of indignation with which the demand for a shutdown of labor has been received in some quarters, and especially by some workers, one must go back to any afternoon in the beautiful summer time, when the baseball season was at its height, and recall the thousands who found time, day after day, to spend from one to three hours on a grandstand, engrossed with the hits and misses of their favorite players. If the hours which these workers gave willingly, cheerfully, and enthusiastically to the national game in one summer were put together, it is quite probable that they wouid stretch out several times the length of the vacation which the Fuel Administration is now enforcing.

The fight to make democracy safe has not called for any great sacrifices in the United States, up to this time. It is asking for none now comparable to the sacrifices which the people of the other allied nationâ€™s freely offer to so great a cause. A few days of enforced idleness, or, rather, of enforced abstention from Usual pursuits, for nobody need be idle, give slight excuse for complaint in view of the fact that tens of thousands of men and women are giving of their all for the common good.
