ROYAL PRIESTESS

The most aristocratic religious institution in the world is that located at Prague, Austria. Only a princess of the imperial family can be appointed as its abbess. In a few cases, when ladies of less aristocratic birth have been chosen for the position, they have always been of noble birth and have enjoyed the right to the title of royal highness. The abbess is installed in office by a solemn ceremony, which is attended by all the high dignitaries of the church and state and an archduke to represent the emperor at the service.
