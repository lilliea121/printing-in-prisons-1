CHRISTMAS DAY SERVICES

Catholic church services was held at the prison Chapel on Christmas morning, the Rev. Michael J. Oâ€™Shea, S.J., officiating.

A select musical program was rendered by the local Catholic choir under the excellent leadership of Professor Joseph Welsh. The sanctuary and altar was elaborately decorated with beautiful flowers and decorative plants, which added to the splendor of the service.

Besides a large number of visitors and inmate communicants, there were present many members of the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners.
