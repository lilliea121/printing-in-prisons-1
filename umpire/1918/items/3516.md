HARNESSING FOUNTAIN PENS

E A. Van Wynen chief clerk of the Southern Pacific’s pay check bureau has designed the “War Pen’’ designed to facilitate his work. Van Wynen has the unique task of signing approximately 100,000 pay checks per month. The rush of war work has caused time to be the most precious commodity dealt in by the Southern Pacific. Also every department has been compelled to devise means of offsetting the shortage of help.

So Van Wynen harnessed five fountain pens together in such a way that he could sign five separate checks at the same time. He proposes to add a pen for every clerk who leaves him to go to the war. He is now signing 2,000 checks an hour and not worrying.
