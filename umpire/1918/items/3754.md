THE SIZE OF RUSSIA

A well known authority says that Russia is about twenty times larger than Germany and France put together, having an area of 8,505,000 square miles, and is larger than all of North America. The population of Russia is supposed to number about 165,000,000, fully 100,000,000 more than that of Germany before the war.
