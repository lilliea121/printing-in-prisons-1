NEW INVENTION FIRES 33,000 BULLETS A MINUTE

A late news report brings the information that a Boston inventor has patented a centrifugal gun that is capable of discharging 33,000 shots a minute.

The manufacture of the gun is being conducted with the greatest secrecy at some place in the east not made known to the public. In a recent test, the inventor claims the gun was aimed at sheets of steel plate three-quarters of an inch thick, and after several minutes of discharge, the largest were examined and it was found that the missiles penetrated the steel sheets asthough they were paper. The bullets are made of steel similar to ball-bearing.

One strong point in the new gunâ€™s favor is, that it has no barrel to overheat, and the mechanism is so simple that jamming is impossible.

It is claimed that the War Department has become interested in the new weapon, and arrangements for a test will be made shortly.
