URGES PRISONERS PAROLE; THEY’LL AID FARMERS

A movement to have prisoners serving sentences for minor offences paroled so they can work on farms, was started by Edwin M. Abbott, chairman of the Commission on revision of the penal laws of Pennsylvania, in a letter to Governor Brumbaugh yesterday,

Mr. Abbott urged the governor to co-operate in requesting all judges of the state to parole prisoners, and he called attention to the fact that over 95 per cent. of all prisoners paroled in this state have made good.

The above news item should hit the majority of us right where we live, and Mr. abbott, and the Governor can’t move fast enough to suit us. ‘‘Breathes there a man with soul so dead, who never to himself hath said back to that dear old farm for mine, whose heart has ne’er within him burned, as for the sausage he has yearned, and dough-nuts of ve olden time.”

And as for 95 per cent. of us probably making good, we’ll wager our last nickel that 190 per cent. of us would make good on a farm, right now. Speaking for ourself no temptation could possibly win us away from a farmer who had even a passably goed cook, in this day and hour of war-bread, and extra charge for butter.
