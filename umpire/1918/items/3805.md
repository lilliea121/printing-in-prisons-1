To the Editor of The Umpire

In reference to your editorial in your issue of April 24th, “The Slacker’’ permit me to say there are fellows who do make the remark you quote, “What did my country ever do for me?’’ If this remark is not made through ignorance, it must be the basest kind of ingratitude. Any young man of military age, born and raised in this country, enjoying all its countless benefits and privileges, its free schools etc., who would refuse to shoulder a gun or in some way go to the defense of his country, is worse than a slacker, he is an ingrate, and is not worthy to be called an American.

Any man who rafuses to stand up for his God, his country, his home or his friend is an abject coward. It is sad but true that even in private life, some people are lacking in gratitude. They cannot appreciate a kindness. Even a dog will wag his tail if you are kind to him. But speaking of Slackers, how about the people who are responsible for restrictions that prevent a man from fighting for his country, simply because he was, or 18, in prison? Just give us a chance and we will prove that there are some Americans even in prison.
