LATEST SPY NOTE

To W. Hohenzollern, Berlin:-

All-Spyest- 

I have discovered during the past week, that,
America launched 47 ships,
And sent 80,000 men to France,
And isn’t worrying about the U-Boats,
And is drafting all men from 18 to 45.
And is going to raise a new Liberty Loan of 5 billion, .
And is determined to retire you to private life,
And the birth rate is increasing,
And the crops are great,
And the E. S. P. Volunteers are ready to go,
And all is discovered.
P.S. Please remit last quarters salary. 

Weiner Wurst 
Spy No, 2313 
Philadelphia Aug, 30. 

To Weiner Wurst, Philadelphia:— 

Not for that kind of news. 

Wilhelm.
