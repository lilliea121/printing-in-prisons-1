ELECTRIC CANOES BECOMING POPULAR

A technical paper declares that since its first appearance in 1908, the electric canoe has become a feature of the upper Thames in England. The motor and storage battery are placed amidships, the frail structure being suitably strengthened, and some of the little craft carry besides this load eight passengers, though a capacity of four is more common. A steering wheel with a three-bladed propeller is usual in recent designs. For the average canoe a thirty-cell battery suffices, and carries a charge for a dayâ€™s run. Silent running ana freedom from vibration are ad- vantages over the gasoline launch.
