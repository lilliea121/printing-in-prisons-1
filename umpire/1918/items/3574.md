WOOD BY THE POUND

Circassian walnut is sold by the pound or the ton, and not by the foot. As early as 116 B. C. it was introduced into Italy from Persia. Russia is the chief source of Circassian walnut. The logs are so heavy that they will not float, and are sold from the forest with their bark on. Only the heart of the wood is used, and it is the crooked, irregular logs that possess the best-figured wood. Even very old trees rarely have a clear length of more than ten feet.
