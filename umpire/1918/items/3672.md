EXPLAINING THE UNIVERSE

I suppose that we have all bad moments of sudden illumination when it occurred to us that we had explained the universe, and it was so easy for us that we wondered why we had not done it before, writes S. M. Crothers, in the Atlantic. Some thought drifted into our mind and filled us with vague forbodings of omnmiscience. It was not an ordinary thought that explained only a fragment of existence. It explained everything. It proved one thing and it proved the opposite just as well. It explained why things are as they are, and if it should turn out that they are not that way at all, it would prove that fact also. In the light of our great thought chaos seemed rational. Having explained the universe, we relapse into satisfied slumber. When a few hours later, we rise, we wonder what the explanation was.
