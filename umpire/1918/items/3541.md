PAPER CLOTHING

Paper clothing has long been known, sometimes for its cussedness, but recently there was discovered a method of waterproofing cloth made from wood pulp which greatly increases the life of the garment. Some paper cloth is brittle, but there is one variety known to the Japanese which will withstand 87,500 foldings without breaking.
