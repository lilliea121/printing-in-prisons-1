BIRDS OF A FEATHER We often run across a fellow in here, who will very solemnly assert that he is-entirely innocent of the crime of which he was convicted, and that being in here is but the result of another "frame-up". It may be the whole truth in this particular man's case, and if so, then he is but one of many who have in years gone by been sent to a prison innocent. But a great many of these "innocent ones" give themselves away, when they recite the details of their arrest, and reveal the company they were in at the time. It was either a "Jimmie the Yegg" or a "Jack the Prowler", and sometimes both,—and the "innocents abroad" were of course entirely ignorant that these men had a record, and that their presence among them was but an unfortunate incident.— Having no personal experience along these lines, and therefore cannot tell how these "incidents" occur so often; we can but reason according to the old and reliable adages that "Birds of a feather will flock together" ,—and "By the company you keep you will be judged".— A fellow, who is not on a dishonest errand bent,— and who is earning his bread by the sweat of his braw,— and who guards over his reputation as he would his life, will never be found in company with any man of a "Rogue gallery" repute,— so if he was arrested, convicted, and sent toa place like this "only" because he was "palling" with the boys of the tenderloin, then the Judge did not err much.— So when the gates of this prison once more open to you, and you again have the choice of your road,— go up North into the friendless wilderness rather, than return to the deceiving South, where you might again fall the victim of a "frame-up".— B 7401
