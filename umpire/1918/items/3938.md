NOTICE

All men in the institution, who are holding in their possession more than the permitted number of library books, are requested to deliver the surplus to the ‘‘library runner" on the first regular Library Day of their block or gallery.

The failure to comply with this may result in the forfeiture of library privileges.

Write down in plain figures at least twenty or more selections of books on the reverse side of your slate.

By ORDER OF WARDEN.
