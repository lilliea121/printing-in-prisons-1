WASHINGTON-LAFAYETTE FLAG AT INDEPENDENCE HALL

At noon on Washington’s birthday, as a filling tribute to the father of democracy and Liberty, and as a tribute to our gallant French allies, the Washington-Lafayette flag was raised on Independence Hall by the Citizens Committee who had the ceremony in charge.

As soon as the banner was unfurled the National Anthem was sung. The emblem, measuring 20 by 10 feet, and showing the names of Washington and Lafayette above thirteen stripes and thirteen encircled stars, is the same flag which was raised September 6 last, Lafayette’s birthday. A replica was hoisted in Paris at the time.
