FORMER PASTOR PARDONED

An Indianapolis, Ind., correspondent writes that the Rev. William E. Hinshaw, sentenced to prison for life more than twenty years ago, has been granted a pardon. The writer says that Hinshaw probably was Indianaâ€™s most noted prisoner.

The pardon given Hinshaw becomes operative at once. This will allow the former clergyman to go back to his ranch in the the Southwest as he desires. He purchased the ranch last year while on s temporary parole. Before his return to prison at the expiration of his temporary parole in 1917 Hinshaw is said to have married, and it is believed that his wife is now living on the ranch.
