UNFAILING CONFIDENCE ESSENTIAL

Confidence is the greatest essential. Continuous confidence is the ideal of your own making that compels success, observes an educator. Some men never question the possibility of defeat. They may have set-backs but not defeats. They are right and know themselves tobe right. The rest of the world may be ranged against them for all they care. They have a mission ard nothing short of it will satisfy. Thatâ€™s what you should have. Get the proper self-estimate and move up to your place.
