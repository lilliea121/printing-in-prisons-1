SOLDIER SON WINS HIS FATHER’S PARDON

A late news dispatch announces that Governor Cox of Ohio, cabled the word—‘‘pardoned’’—to a soldier with the American expeditionary forces in France, in reply to an appeal made by an Ohio boy to the Governor, asking for his father’s pardon from the state penitentiary.

“I am willing to die for my country and I could die happy if I could but know he is free to regain his standing in the world," wrote the boy.

The man was liberated with several others who had agreed to enter government service during the continuance of the war. The soldier’s father had an excellent record while in prison, and as it was his first offence, Governor Cox decided to grant the pardon so earnestly soughtby a loving son. At the request of both father and son the Governor did not make known the name of the pardoned man.
