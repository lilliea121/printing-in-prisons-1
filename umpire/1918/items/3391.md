KHAT EATING IN ARABIA

The habit of eating khat is widely and generally practiced in Arabia, and often in the intervals between fresh chews of khat a piece of candy is eaten. Khat is the Arabic name for a shrub (Catha edulis, natural order Celasetracea), which, so far as is known, grows in the Turkish Yemen and in the Harrar district of Abyssinia. The young leaves and tender stems are chewed. Kkat has a stimulating effect upon the nerve and brain cells, and is supposed to cheer the melancholy and to give strength to the weary. It is eaten only when fresh and is very expensive in Aden.

The wealthier Arabs gather at specified hours in the afternoon and at night, in either public or private ‘‘mabrazes,” for khat chewing and combine with it the reading of stories or of the Koran, singing, or serious conversation. The laborer, whenever he can afford it, chews khat as he works.
