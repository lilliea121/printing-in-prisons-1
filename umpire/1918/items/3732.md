CIVIL WAR PRICES OF TOOD

Although the average cost of food in the North was lower during the Civil War than at the present time, the burden on the people was much heavier on account of the lower wages that prevailed in those days. From 1861 to 1863, when the crest of the high price was reached, the increase varied from 66 to 75 per cent., and in a few instances it reached 100 per cent. Eggs, for example, sold for 15 cents a dozen in 1861, and in 1863 they ‘‘soared’’ to 25 cents a dozen. Cheese advanced from eight cents to 18 cents a pound. Potatoes sold for $1.50 a bushel in 1861 and for $2.25 in 1863. Sugar rose to 15 cents a pound, and butter at one time cost 80 cents a pound. Cotton cloth was scarce and reached its highest price at 81 a yard. The average pay of the common laborer in Civil War was $1.25 a day, as against $3 a day or more the laborers are now demanding. Blacksmiths and bricklayers $2 a day, painters $1.75, joiners and shipbuilders $2, and quarrymen $1.12. Contrasting these wages with the pay of men in similar occupations today, it can be seen that the cost of living is farless troublesome now than it was in the period from 1861 to 1864.
