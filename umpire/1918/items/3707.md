A LETTER OF THANKS 

March 20, 1918.

Mr. Charles Carver, 
Stephen Girard Bldg.,
Philadelphia, Penna.

Dear Mr. Carver:â€” 

Captain Fallon has asked me to gratefully acknowledge receipt of your kind favor of March 11th which is very much appreciated.

Of the possible two hundred lectures which he has delivered since he has been in the United States, none have seemed to inspire him like the one he delivered at the Penitentiary. He says that he felt as if he could go on talking forever, and the beautiful tribute from the Honor and Friendship Club, something that will be appreciated by him forever.

If there is ever another opportunity where he can serve you, please do not hesitate to call upon him.

Very sincerely yours,

SIDNEY J. BURGOYNE.
