WEDNESDAY P. M. BIBLE SCHOOL

Chaplain Welch’s Bible School held its regular meeting on Wednesday afternoon April 10. After recitation of the Lord’s prayer, a talk from our Chaplain, responsive reading of the days lesson by Mr. Dipple, a lady visitor, Mrs. Thomas Barnly, entertained by singing two selections. The speaker for the afterncon was Rev. Dr. William Kuhn, a traveling Baptist preacher. Dr. Kuhn’s remarks were up to the minute, and the rapt attention he received was a guarantee that all who heard him appreciated his visit. Prof. A. F. Weigandt was with us and assisted at the choir with the cornet. Mr. Geo. W. Sanville of the Rodheaver Co., was with us again, as was also our good friend Mrs. Frank Dipple.
