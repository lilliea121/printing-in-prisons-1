ORIGINALLY DEMOCRATIC

Over six hundred years ago it was the old Russia that arose out of Rurik the Norman’s conquest, and had it’s capital at Kiev. There were czars and overlords after a fashion.

But the real government of Russia was in the market place at Kiev and on every little town and village on the great wide steppes, where on the great days of the year the people gathered together, warriors, traders, women, too, choose their local official. The original heart of Russia was democratic to the core.
