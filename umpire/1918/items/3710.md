YOUNGEST JURIST APPOINTED TO BENCH

It is announced that John C. Knox, nominated by President Wilson as Judge for the Southern District of New York, will be the youngest jurist on the Federal bench. He was born at Waynesburg, Pa., thirty-six years ago, was graduated from Waynesburg College in 1902, studied law at the University of Pennsylvania and served as city magistrate in Waynesburg in 1906.

During a portion of his five-year period of service as Assistant United States Attorney, he had charge of the Federal criminal bureau and personally investigated and passed on thousands of enemy-alien internment cases.

He was in charge of prosecution of Lieutenant Robert Fay, a German officer convicted of plotting to blow up munition ships, and directed the investigation of the alleged Hindu conspiracy to cause a revolutionary uprising in India.
