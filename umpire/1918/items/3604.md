PRESIDENT ENDORSES 8-HOUR DAY

A Portland, Ore., correspondent says that a telegram from President Wilson indorsing the action of the lumbermen of the Northwest in voluntarily granting a basic eight-hour day in the lumber industry was received by Colonel Brice P. Disque, head of the Aeroplane Spruce Preductive Campaign. The President’s telegram reads:

I was sincerely glad to hear of the action of the lumbermen in instituting the eight-hour day. I think they will find this an act not only of wise policy, but of good sense from every point of view.”
