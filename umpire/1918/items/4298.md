THE DESERVING PRISONER

We tender the most humble and sincere apologies to the ‘‘deserving prisoner’’, so feelingly spoken of in another colurrn by an We had not guessed they were so numerous, or their task sogreat. To them in their great task of upholding the Warden —whatever that may mean— we wish all success, and are sincerely sorry that we have hitherto failed to feature them in our columns, a fate which shall be theirs no longer, We had believed them to be as the timid and shrinking violet, their works speak for them, and had acted accordingly, but now that we know that the sound of trumpets blown from the house- tops is pleasant to their ears, we shall en- deavor to make amends for all neglect.

So, behold us struggling feebly in the throes of a vast remorse, and with real tears in our eyes, tendering the most abject of apologies to all those who really "count", with the hope that our sins of omission may be forgiven on our promise of ample justice being done in the future to the labors of the local Moses who so gallantly hold up the Warden's hands.
