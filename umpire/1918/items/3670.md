BELIEVE IN ELFIN MINERS

All over Europe a popular belief prevails that elfin miners are constantly laboring in the bowels of the mountains, where they have accumulated enormous stores of precious metals. In Wales they are called “knockers.” They make strange noises, and the tapping of the picks may often be heard in ore bodies not yet reached by the human workmen.
