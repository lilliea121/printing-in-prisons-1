FOUGHT DEATH PENALTY

The remarkable career of Sir Samuel Romilly, the British statesman, came to a tragic end 99 years ago. He was the first influential man in England to attempt to bring about the abolition of capital punishment, notes a London correspondent. When he entered public life the English statutes punished with death nearly 300 ciimes, ranging from murder and treascn down to keeping company with gypsies. Romilly, who was of French descent, launched an agitation against these codes, and in 1808 he succeeded in repealing the Elizabethan statute which made it a capital from the person of another.

From that time until his death he waged war unceasingly against these cruel statutes, renewing his motions session after session, and although he failed, he cleared the way for the success of others who kept up the agitation. Romilly was devoted to his wife, and when she died, October 29, 1818, the philanthropist fell into a delirium of grief.

Four days later his grief had so preyed on his mind that he went mad and killed himself.
