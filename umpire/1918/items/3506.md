LABOR TO RULE AFTER WAR

It is announced in a Boston despatch that Charles W. Elliot, president emeritus of Harvard and one of the ecountry’s deepest thinkers on both social and industrial econcmics, agrees with Charles M. Schwab, president of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, who recently declared that the ‘‘men without property’’ will soon rule the world. But Mr. Elliot dves not confine himself to workers alone; he adds thinkers. Here is his comment on the rule-of-the-workers prediction:

"I find the statement attributed to Mr, Schwab a little obscure and somewhat mis- leading, doubtless because he was inaccurately reported. However,Tagree with thestatement attributed to him that the wurkers are going to rule; but under the term ‘workers’ I include the thinkers, teachers, inventors snd managers, and I expect that in the future, as in the recent past, this latter class of work- ers will do most of the ruling and most of the solving of the great economic questions now being conducted, at least in free countries.”
