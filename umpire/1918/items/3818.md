INSTITUTION VISITORS GIVE POINTERS ABOUT ENEMY

Capt. W. A. Ross, of the Royal Engineers, and Miss E. M. McCawley, of the Motor Messenger Service, were Institution visitors during the week. Capt. Ross is an American who early heard the call to service, enlisting in the Canadian Forces at the beginning of the war, and has seen much service at the Front. The gallant Captain gave many valuable pointers on the proper treatment of the enemy, laying special emphasis upon the winning qualities of cold steel in any argument with the Hun.

He was sportman enough to give high praise to the fighting qualities of the enemy in particular the Bavarians and Saxons; and said that man for man they were our equal, (our idea of the proper ratio would be one American to two Huns, but we may be wrong; tho we confess weâ€™d like to try it) and that the winning of the war was, in the last analysis, a question of man power alone; that numbers must tell in the end, and this advantage lay with us. The Captain was offered some recruits, but gracefully deferred decision.
