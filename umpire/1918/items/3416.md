A FOLDING SEAPLANE

In storing or sheltering the usual airplane there is a tremendous amount of space wasted. This is due to the fact that the airplane is shaped like a T. with the wings representing the cross stroke, and the fuselage the stem. Efficiently handled, the airplane should take up but little more room than the stem or fuselage space. At least, so has the storage and shelter problems struck the British authorities; end they have developedairplanes which are provided with folding wings. We note a type of folding wing seaplane which is being used at a naval school along the English coast. The planes which are hinged to the forward part of the fuselage, can be swung back until they are alongsidg the fuselage. The elevating planes, it will be noted, fit in between the planes and struts. All in all, the folded seaplane can be accommodated well within a space of ten feet by thirty feet, instead of the usual space of forty or more feet by thirty feet.
