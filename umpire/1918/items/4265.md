Some one ofhis workmen brought a perfect shoe to Mr, Patterson, of the Shoe Shop, on a day of last week, and in the resultant heat of enthusiasm a blaze was generated among some rubbish, which was only extinguished at a cost of much tumult and shouting. Also, if vile odors can do it, the Shoe Shop was thoroly disinfected thereby.
