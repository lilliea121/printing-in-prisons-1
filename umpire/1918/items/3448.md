NEW YORK’S NEW SUBWAY

A New York correspondent informs us that that city opened a new subway line in its transportation system on Sunday, when an extension of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit’s underground line was put in operation on Broadway, placing at the public’s convenience a line between Times Square in Manhattan, and Times Plaza, Brooklyn, and connecting with other subways.

It is announced that women will be employed as ticket agents and as tram guards.
