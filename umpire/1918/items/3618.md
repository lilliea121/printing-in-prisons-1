THE SETTLEMENT OF ST. LOUIS

It is recorded that the first permanent settlement on the site of St. Louis was established in 1764 by Pierre Ligueste Laclede, but it was not until 108 years ago that the future city was incorporated as a town. Founded by the French, the frontier post was for a time under Spanish domination, but was restored to France and in 1803 transferred to the United States. The inauguration of steamboat traffic on the Mississippi gave the town a boom, and in 1822 it was incorporated as a city, with an area of 385 acres and a population of about 5,000. For a decade the population remained almost stetionary, but by 1840 it had reached the 17,000 mark. The revolution in Germany in 1848 gave St. Louis another big push forward, for thousands of exiles from the kingdom of the Hohenzollerns found a refuge in the Missouri city. St. Louis also had a large Irish-born contingent.

For a time feeling ran high against the foreigners. The native American spirit was rampant and resulted in many bloody riots.
