THE UMPIRE LET US SETTLE IT FOR YOU. One often hears in our yards groups of men passing their judgment on the age of this institution, the length of the walls, their height, depths and thickness etc. and also whether the property is leased or owned by the state and many other interesting local problems. In these groups one generally finds one fellow who "knows," but before the others have given in to him quite an argument has taken place. Please allow us therefore to settle it for you. This institution was opened in 1829 and is therefore about 90 years old and covers an area of 10 acres of ground. The walls around it are of granite and 35 feet high, 12 feet thick at the base, and 2 3/4 feet in thickness at the top. The wall facing Fairmont avenue is 670 feet in length, the great gateway is 27 feet high and 15 feet wide, and the airspace enwalled by the halls and cells is over 10,000,000 cubic feet. The property is owned by the State of Pennsylvania. We wager that the fellow who "knew" lost.
