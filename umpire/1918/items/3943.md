PARDONS ISSUED JULY L

Harrisburg, June, 21.

Owing to the large number of cases acted upon by the Sta'e Board of Pardons at itâ€™s June session; the iargest in the recent history of the tribunal, the pardons will hardly be issued before July 1st. Reasons will be worked out at once, and then sent to the Governor for his action. This month the Board sat for hearings on two consecutive days, something which has been done only twice in the last decade.
