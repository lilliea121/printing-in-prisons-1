TRUE SERVICE

“The most blessed of human endeavors is sarvice for others,” says a well known writer. The service that “educates and builds and makes this old world a better and happier place in which to live and work. Service is the spirit of the hour. It blesses him that gives and him that gets; it is the brotherhood of man in business; it is the helping hand extended unselfishily; it is bread cast upon the waters; it is a way of helping ourselves by helping each other. The best that can be said of any man is this: “He served others that they mlght better serve themselves."
