POOR AMIDST PLENTY

So prolific was the island of Mindoro, in the Philippines, at one time in the production of rice that it was popularly called ‘‘the grainary of the Philippines. ’’ Sugar, cotton, hemp and other crops thrive on the island when properly cultivated. Yet its economic conditions are extremely backward, and a large part of its population is in a constant state of poverty. It has altogether about 39,000 inhabitants. Of the whole, more than 7,000 are pronounced savages, a large part of the remainder are densely ignorant.
