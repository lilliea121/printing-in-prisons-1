THE SOAP BERRY TREE

The jaboncello, or soap berry tree, grows in the humid parts of western Ecuador. It attains a height of 50 feet and has wide-spreading branches and immense quanities of fruit of the size and shape of cherries. The nearby transparent yellow skin and pulp surrounding the black seeds are so saponaceous as to be used instead of soap, being equivalent to more than 50 times their weight of that material.
