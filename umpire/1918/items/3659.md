HONOR MEDALS WILL BE GIVEN TO U. S. SOLDIERS

A Washington despatch announces that new decorations and insignia for American soldiers have been ordered by the War Deppartment in the order of their value, as distinguished-service cross, distinguished-service medal, war-service chernons and wound chernons.

The “D. S. C.” of the American army is to be a bronze cross of appropriate design and a ribbon tu be worn in lieu thereof, to be awarded by the President or by the commander in chief of the American expeditionary forces for ‘‘extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United States under circumstances which do not justify the award of the medal of honor.”
