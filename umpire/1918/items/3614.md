THE EMBLEM OF FRANCE

It is well to know that the fluer de lis is the emblem of France, and is believed to be the white-flowered Florentine Iris, the flower de luce. “What sayest thou, my fair flower de luce?’’ says the English king to the French princess in Shakespeare’s play. The French have a pretty legend of their lily which tells that at the baptism of King Clovis, of the long and perfumed hair, a blue banner came fluttering down from heaven over which were sprinkled golden fluer de lis. From that time to this they appear on the arms of the “fluerdelises,’’ meaning to embroider scattered flowers over a fabric, or, as embroiderers say, to ‘‘pepper with flowers.” Edward III borrowed the lilies of France after his war with that country and they were born by English until the beginning of the nineteenth century.
