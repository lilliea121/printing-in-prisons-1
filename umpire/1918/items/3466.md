OUR CONSCIOUSNESS OF MONEY

Many factors go toward lowering the tcne of this mankind whence genius should spring as a madman or a god. One is our intense consciousness of money, avers W. L. George, in Harper’s Magazine. The discovery of money is recent, for the rich men of the Bible wanted flocks and lands only so that they might eat well, drink well and wed fair women; the lust of Ahab was rather unusual. At other times, in Babylon, in Venice, wealth brought material benefits first, later only distinction. Only with the rise of tne middle class did wealth become the greatest force, for it alone could make the middle class equal with their fellows. As they could claim no lineage they naturally came to want to claim themselves better than their kind—the merchant princes of the Victorian period, their sideboards, barouches and sarcophagi; the American millionaires with their demon sreed cars, their Ritz-Carlton dinners, their investments in old masters (guarenteed mouldy) are natural consequences. Whereas in the seventeenth century if you could impress if you were a duke, in the twentieth century if you become a millionaire you can stun. And you can stun only because everybody admires you for being a millionaire, because, as Miss Marion Ashworth perfectly says, ‘‘there are people whom the mention of great fortunes always makes solemn.”
