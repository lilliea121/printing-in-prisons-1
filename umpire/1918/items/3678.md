THE PROCESS OF NATURE

Most interesting is the process of nature even though not fully understcod the way and the wherefore are complex and worthy of deepest study, observes a naturalist, but the bold facts, uncoupled with reasons of any kind, are delightful to contemplate. This interest will grow upon you and the next thing you know, unless you are indeed shallow-pated, you will be keen to make more observations, with a new and charming part of this grand old world, or a small piece thereof, being opened before you. Try it and see.
