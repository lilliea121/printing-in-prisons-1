SAYS NATION NEEDS SHOCK

A letter from Chicago informs us that the indifferent attitude of America toward the war and the tendency to regard it as a side issue was condemned by Rollin P. Grant, president of the Irving National Bank of New York in an address before the National League of Commission Merchants recently in session there. Only a rending shock will awaken the nation to a true realization of the gigantic task it is facing in winning the war, Mr. Grant predicted.

“Our war vessels have been destroyed, our soldiers and sailors killed and captured, and our casualty lists are being publiched from day to day,” Mr. Grant said, ‘‘yet, in the face of this, we go on from day to day living in an atmosphere of smug peace and security, making the war effort that comes to us, that is forced upon us, as if we do not realize, even as if we refuse to realize, that this is now our war and we alone must win it."
