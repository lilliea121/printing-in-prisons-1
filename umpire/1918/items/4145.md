TRENTON PRISON GIVES $1,587

The Imner Voice reports that the Trenton, New Jersy State Prison has contributed $1,382 to the Red Cross Fund, and $205 to the Negro War Relief Association. The new and enlightened government recently inaugurated in that long neglected institution is bearing fruit of a golden hue. Governor Edge and Warden Mulheron are justified in the confidence reposed in the good intentions of the men inside. Each month strengthens the inmate Welfare organization and proves the usefulness of character rebuilding by results obtained.
