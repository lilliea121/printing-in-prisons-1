THINKS U. S. WILL PROFIT BY THE WAR

It is certain that the war will complete the development of the national individuality of the United States is the conviction expressed by Dr. M. H. Vesnitch, head of the Serbian mission to the United States, in a statement given to the Petit Parisen, Paris, France.

That, he said, would be the most positive and fortunate result of the struggle, and civilization throughout the habitable globe would profit by it.

Doctor Vesnitch said he returned frcm the United States fully convinced that Ameiica would not stop halfway, adding:

She could rot, even if she would, furl her banners before victory has shone upon them. That would mean—and this is fully realized in competent quarters—not only stagnation, but decline. It would be at the same time a setback for humanity in general. Americans will never accept that.”
