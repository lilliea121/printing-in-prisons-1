THE “GROUCH.”

There is no more disgusting and repelling than the ’’grouch’’. It matters not what causes his sourness; let his home be full of troubles, he is but a poor alibi of a man if he carries it with him to his place of work, where the combined shares of each co-workers sociability and good will to one another decide whether the day shall turn out dull or bright.

The happy and contented spirit of a hundred can be dampened by just one such ’’crabby’’ individual. If this ’’grouch’’ then have any authority in the shop at all, he finds faults where there are none; he looks for oppor- tunities to cool off any attempt to drive away the cloud he brought, and if he canfind a possible cause to inflict a hurt by the exercising of his authority, he will do it.

But there is one consolation his associates of the shop at least have;they can seek work else where if they do not like his ways and in leaving, express their disgust with him. But it is a pity when such a ’’grouch’ is permitted to bring his repelling traits into a penal institution where men, unfortunately, have been cornered, and who have been shorn of all chances to defend themselves.

The wearisome days of a conviet can be lightened immensely with but one smile from the keeper, but also bring to his heart depression, discomfort and hatred, if left to the mercy of a ’’grouch’’.
