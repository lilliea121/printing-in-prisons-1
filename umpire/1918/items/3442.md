NEW FIBER PLANT

A Consular report states that a new Costa Rican fiber plant has been developed through selection and cultivation by M. Peralta of San Jose, and is alleged to produce more and stronger fiber than henequen or sisal.

The fiber is made into rope, twine, mats, bazs, and even finer articles. The spineless leaaf is 9 to 12 feet long, and each plant averages 30 leaves a year, yielding two pounds of fiber. With about 600 plants to the acre, cane, beans, potatoes, or corn can be grown on the same land. Full growth is reached in five years, but cuttings—two a year—may begin two years after planting the shoots.
