THE EASY WAY

The get-rich-quick man ordered wine 
And bade his chauffeur wait a while, 
And then sat gayly down to dine 
On richest foods in splendid style. 
And men there were who envied him 
And wondered at his fortune rare; 
They found the going hard and grim, 
Beset with sorrow and despair. 

The get-rich-quick man didn’t work; 
His schemes brought money rolling in. 
He used to chortle, with a smirk, 
It was an easy thing to win. 
But men there were who plodded on 
And honestly essayed to climb 
The heights of fame, and every one 
Was busy struggling all the time.

The get-rich-quick man had the best 
Of everything to drink and eat. 
He merely had to dodge arrest; 
But that was something of a feat. 
And one fine day detectives came 
And threw him in a prison cell. 
They ‘‘busted’’ up his little game, 
And then you should have heard him yell!
