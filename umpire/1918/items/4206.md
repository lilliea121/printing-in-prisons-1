PREVENTIVE JUSTICE

It is contended by many that better treat- ment of prisoners will increase the numbers of “‘repeaters’” and that as soon as they are released they will at once getbusyand break in again; this contention is erroneous if one considers the moral effect of kind treatment as against cruelty and hate.

Most men who have slipped a cog in the wheel of life, do so because of their ignor- ance of the laws of life, not because they choose the wrong deliberately; and it follows that if men go wrong on account of ignorance the best thing the State can do is to find some way of teaching them better in- stead of devoting so much attention to ‘‘re- tributive justice.”” Frem an economic point of view the State would be much the gainer could it send men out of the Penitentiaries with the knowledge that crime does not in- jure society so much as it injures the crimi- nal.

It takes time and a lot of patience to con- vince a man that his conception of life is all wrong even though the man has suffered punishment for his mistakes; habits of thought formed in a vicious environment are hard to eradicate and it is impossible to in- duce a man to think along lines of self-im- provement so long as he thinks he is being treated unjustly, even though he may be perfectly conscious of his own short-comings.

This comment is prompted by the writers observation of the great improvement in the attitude of the men in this institution and their tendency to regard life in a kindlier and more optimistic spirit as a result of the re. cent efforts on the part of the Prison Admin- istration to make still better their conditions.

Friendliness and kindlinesshave apparently found place in the hearts of all, and seem- ingly all are agreed, that the world—and the E. S. P.—is not such a bad place to live. in, after all.
