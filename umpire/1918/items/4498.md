SHOWERS OF BLESSING ON THE PATHWAY OF LIFE Mrs. Elizabeth A. S. Treher, a former matron of this institution, end Mr. Pendelton Garber were united in marriage last Tuesday Dec. 17, by our Chaplain Rev. Joseph Welch. Mrs. Treher was considered by the officials a most capable, and faithful officer, and by the prisoners a, valuable friend, whose tact, kindness, and sweet temperament gave to them much solace in their hours of depression, and it is a pleasure to voice the sentiment of her former wards in these few lines of tribute; and though they are sorry to lose her, they rejoice in knowing that she is safe in the hands of a happy future.
