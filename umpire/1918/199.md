THE UMPIRE

BE A REAL MAN

‘A boy hearing his father say, ‘Twas a
poor rule that wouldn’t work both ways,
said: If father applies this rule about his
work, I will test it in my play.’’ So setting up
a row of bricks, he tipped over the first,
which, striking the second, caused it to fall
on the third, which overturned the fourth,
and so on, until the bricks lay prostrate be-
fore him. ‘‘Well,”’ said the little boy,”’
‘‘each brick has knocked down his neighbor,
I only tipped one. Now I will raise one and
see if he will raise hls neighbor.’” He looked
in vain to see them rise. ‘‘Here father,”’
said the boy, ‘‘‘tis a poor rule that will not
work both ways. They knock each other
down, but will not raise each other up.”’
My son, bricks and mankind are alike made
of clay, active in knocking each other down,
but not disposed to help each ether up.”’
‘“‘Father’’ said the boy, ‘‘does the first brick
represent the first Adam?’’ The' father re-
plied: ‘“When men fall, they love company,

' but when they rise they love to stand alone,

like your brick, and see others prostrate

* before them.

It is true what this father stated to his
boy, that when a man falls he loves com-
pany, but if he has succeeded in rising to any
station in life he begrudges another man a
similar chance, and from this moral we in
here should drawalesson. Ifyouhave made
yourself so insecure that you must fall, do
not drag with you some other fellow; be a
man, and stand the consequences like one.

Should you on the other hand succeed in
reaching a place in the sun and thereisroom
for another; be again a man, and share it
with him.

ELUSIVE HAPPINESS

We must remember one thing. It is not
absolutely necessary to be happy. It is all

very well to talk about happiness, but one
of the strangest contradictions of life isthat
we can never find happiness, if we search
for it. Happiness is elusive. It will escape
us, if we seek to hold it. Butif we go our
way, if we refuse to lose our faith, no matter
how sad we may be, no matter how weary or
how disheartened, we will learn to find hap-
piness in little things, in the reading of a
book, in the singing of a song, in the making
of a dress, in the doing of our work,

It is the last thing indeed that is the real
cure for the disillasionment of life that comes
to each of us. Work is the great panacea.

If we work, and work well, we shall find
much to compensate us. And if along the
way we chcose to pretend that dreams
do sometimes come true, who can blame us?

The first Yankee soldiers toleave for home,
sailed from Liverpool, Friday, cn the liners
Lapland, and Minnehaha. They were several
thousand in number, and were given a royal

send-off by their British cousins.

IDLENESS

Idleness is the curse of mankind. When a
man has nothing to do, it is impossible to
breed better instinets in him. It isthe cause
of crime.
to do, he has not time to brood over his con-
finement, or to continually plan to commit
new crimes. This prison in regard to work
is making a splended showing. There are
very few idle men and they are infirm. Any
shop that can use these men is 'being sup-
plied. With the Board of Clemency paroling
men g the rate of a hundred a month, it has,
forced the prison population down below the
1800 mark. The munition factories have
taken a large number of men who were given
the chance by the Clemency Board and their

place or honor or in the shopsare being filled

as rapidly as possible. This speaks good for
the authorities, when you take into consider-
ation the fact that three years ago there
were over Five Hundred prisoners sitting in
the idle house with nothing to do but swap
lies. This was unbearable and resulted in
men being trensferred to the Lima State
Hospital. But where men are given the

chance to work—which means that by good

behavior in the shops, one can earn his re-.
lease sooner than the man who refuses to
work or takes not the slightest interestinit.

It is impossible to be a shiftless worker
and get away with it continually for you will
get caught in the end and it will be a black
mark against your record. So when the
time comes for you to be paroled, dont be
surprised that your slip says ‘‘continued.’”

You cannot expect the Clemency Board to
parole any man who refuses to work and who

would rather remain idle.
