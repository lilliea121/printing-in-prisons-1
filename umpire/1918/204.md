~ hundreds of Xmas cards was received from
- Mr. E. J. Lafferty, of the Board of Inspec-
tors, who thus repeated his generous act of
- the preceding year. These were disposed of
among the Inmates for a purely nominal sum,
enabling those fortunate enough to secure
some of the same to appropriately remember
the home folks, or frieuds, at little cost.
We are very deeply in Mr. Lafferty’s debt
by reason of his kindly thought, and deed.
The Kiddies Xmas Fund was brought to a
triumphant conclusion in the course of the
week; a resume of the same will be found
elsewhere. The total being approximately

$204.00 for the year from the Inmates alone, .

which will be materially increased hy the
donations of outside friends, including a

“remembprance of $5.00 from the late “Chrly”
of pleasant memory, and also $5.00 from the
Chaplain. We have some 274 kiddies on the
list, evenly divided between boys, and girls,
- and the price of toys, clothing, etc.,has risen
appreciably, but the above-mentioned sum,
added to a Balance of about $150.00 remain-
ing from last year when we were exception-
ally fortunate in our buying, should be suf-
ficent to give each and every one of these
- little ones who must suffer for deeds of ours,

- one Happy Day.

Saturday’s entertaiment, looked farward
to with suchinterest, because of the promised
appearance of the feature Picture, ‘The

~ Kaiser, the Beast of Berlin’’ was in every

way up to, and in some instances surpassed

~_expectation, for Miss Russell, not to be ont-

done, brought in an extraordinarily brilliant
_constellation of vaudeville ‘‘stars”’, and for
] the “‘boys’’ had
a most enjoyable time, watching the vicious
