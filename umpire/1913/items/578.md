A NOVEL EXHIBIT There has recently been placed on exhibition in the Library, a beautiful piece of mechanical construction, the handiwork of B 6281 which is exciting the admiration of visitors, and in fact, of all who see it. It is a perfect reproduction, in miniature of the newest and most expensive type of carrousels and complete in every detail, even to the familiar sound of the ever-present organ, as the proud little ponies drawing the elaborate chariots make their "merry-go-round." The carrousel is mounted on a substantial tripod, is equipped with an organ, and small motor which can be operated with dry-batteries, or with current from an ordinary electric light wire. It is exceedingly well proportioned, the lines graceful and closely following the original. The whole is surmounted with an overhanging canopy, with hand-painted edgings, and no feature is lacking, that is contained in the large expensive machines, seen in the amusement Parks.
