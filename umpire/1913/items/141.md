A DESCRIPTION OF WEDNES-
DAY’S GAME,— LIBRARY

AND PLASTERERS

—Timmie

Iuto the box, old Curly goes,
He winds right up and then he throws,
A strike, and two and once again,
He fanned fifteen of the Library men.

A hit is made, into a yard,
A home run’s marked on the score card
But there’s a kick from Manager Jim,
As what the rules have always been.

Not to be left, old Dave chimes in,
He kicks with vigor, might and vim,

The ¢ Ump” is called into the fray,
But he don’t know just what to say,

While all this outburst goes ahead,
The Plasterers back-stop is not dead,

The brand-new ball now in demand,
Has vanished—just some slight of hand.

Another growl, from all concerned,
The abuse he gets, the catcher earned,

But with a smile, these words are heard,
“‘Now can’t you take a gentleman’'s word.”’

The game goes on, one inning more
And now it’s Dave, who has the floor,

The crowd they laugh and shout with glee
His funny antics, strange to see.

The whistle blows, the game is through
But they don’t quit the ‘‘rag to chew,”

I'm sure that those who saw the game,
Don’t know who was the most to blame.
