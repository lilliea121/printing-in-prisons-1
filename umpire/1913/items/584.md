WHO'S WHO In MacKentieville Who spouts all day in pigeon-Dutch, and when he is through, it don't mean much? Who roots and shouts for the " Ninth" to win, and backs his bets with an old Sen tin? Who makes scrumptious cakes, and luscious pies, to gladden the sight of Willie's eyes? Who can make any old thing, out of a slab of dough? Why that German gent, that slick Ot-to.
