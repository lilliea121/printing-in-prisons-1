The Poet, late manager of the Library,
is now managing the Band. We believe
there will be more harmony in the Band
than there was in the Library.

Don’t feel sorry for yourself if you
can’t get along with your cellmate—
perhaps he needs sympathy more than
you do.

The indiscriminate throwing of balls
by players before the game should be
prohibited. The pitchers and catchers
should be the only ones allowed to
play before four o’clock and they to be
confined to the side lines.

The lecture to be given Saturday will
be the last until next Fall. With the
coming examinations and vacation, the
students of the University can not find
time to attend. Those who were fortu-
nate enough to attend the lectures dur-
ing the past year, desire to tender their
thanks and appreciation to the gentle-
men who so generously contributed their
time to make these lectures instructive
and entertaining.
