A POLICE LIEUTENANT smarting under the criticism of reports of six murders and over two hundred cases of robbery in his district since last July lays the blame to the ‘" wholesale jail He doesn't believe in the reformation of criminals, delivery '' from this place last month. ‘ and says "once a crook, always a crook." "Give them the limit," he says, ‘‘for fear is the only emotion they are capable of feeling." The lieutenant entirely overlooks the fact that it is just as important for a policeman to prevent disorder and crime, as it is to apprehend been the criminal after misdeeds have committed. The best policeman is the one from whose district comes the least frequent complaints, and from the officer's own admissions, it would appear that there are excellent reasons apart from the alleged actions of paroled men, for the criticisms of his department which have excited his anger.
