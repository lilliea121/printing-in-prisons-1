SHED WINS FROM LIBRARYThe Library put in an "‘all colored" team to play the Stocking Shed this afternoon, but, the best they could do was to obtain two hits and one unearned run, against the Duckling's five hits and four runs. Jore, formerly of the Cubs, has been added to the Bookmen in exchange for Timmy 2, but, had no opportunity to distinguish himself. Ban, who heretofore has always played good clean ball, was guilty of deliberately blocking Fingers as he was making for first, in the fifth inning. Though no sensational features were introduced, the game was well played, and interesting throughout. The Shed showed up better in team work, than in any game they have thus far played. Score 4—l. Umpires Lippy and James. — Mitch.
