THE PLOT THICKENS

(Continued from last week’s edition,)

Ike quickly disguised himself as
‘“‘Hungry Joe,”’ the con man. Hedrew
three shells and a tripod from his vest
- pocket. Omar became interested. Ike
then pulled out a South Carolina Pardon
Blank that was ornate in gold lettering.
It was embellished with the signature
of the man who wanted to send the Con-
stitution on a certain journey. Ike said
to Omar:

‘“This is the little Japanese puzzle; if
you find the elusive pea, you win this
ninety million dollar new subway bond.
If you lose, then I win your Kohinoor
that you hold in your hand.”” Omar
eagerly picked up one shell and—Iost.
In a fit of remorse, Omar shot himself
through the brain.

ITke immediately put him under arrest.
They jumped in the gray touring ecar,
and went spinning toward Doylestown.
The wind blew Omar’s chin spinnage to
star-board continually. TIke felt some-
thing tickle his ear, but thought another
bright idea was entering his brain. The
titillation recurred so frequently that
Ike, who has a hasty temper, stabbed
Omar nine times through the heart.
The tire busted!

At the point of a gun Ike forced Omar
to mend that tire with a bottle of Peru-
na that Omar never was without. Soon
they were speeding into Altoona.

My reader should now pay attention
to the way Ike’s bright mind began to
work; it is instructive. Des Moines Ike

knew better than to turn Omar over to
the Chester police. They would claim

the reward. What did Ike do? Listen!
He stopped the car at Jake Flivver’s
store in Chambersburg, and bought three
bushels of peanuts. Then they walked
to the woods. Omar began to browse
on those Hamlet pills. Ike wanted to
keep Omar’s mind and mouth busy, he
knew Omar would cheerfully serve a
life sentence if Goobernuts shared his
solitude. Omar would be there when
Ike returned. So Ike started for Coates-
ville, to catch Raffles when he (Raffles)
would enter the Walker hotel to get his
overcoat.

In the meantime, Raffles, mingling
with the crowd in Wanamakers, bought
a base ball mask and—
