AN OBSERVATION

I've noticed in getting along on the track,
In seeking life’s laurelsand premiums high,
A man can do more with a slap on the back
Than ever he does with a punch on the eye.

It makes little matter the style of the cribs
You set out to crack in the face of your foes,

More prizes will come from a dig in the ribs
Than ever were won by a whack on the nose.

In public, in private, Whateverryour field,
Wherever you labor, in hamlets or towns,
A far richer profit, life’s harvests will yield

To mortals whose smilings, outnumber their
frowns.
