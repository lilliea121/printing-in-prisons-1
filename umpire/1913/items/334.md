WILL SOMEONE TELL ME

Sometime ago, I thought how fine,
"Twould be to getateam in line,
That really knew just how to play.
Will someone tell me, does it pay:

The first day came, my pitcher fell,
For many days, he wont be well.

My other star, his finger broke,

Will someone tell me where's the joke?

I traded Fggie for Yeap, you know,
And he’s the boy that sure can throw,
But he’s all in, this awful heat,

Will someone tell me, can this be beat?

My other players are O. K.,

To field and hit they know the way,
But somebow we can’t win a game,
Will someone tell me am I to blame?

The Ninth they surely had to fight,

They played the game with all their might.
My boys, they too, were on the spot.

Will someone tell me, how to get on top?

The Cubs were next, we thought we'd win,
But we got ‘“‘ours’’, it wasa sin,

We simply could not hit that Teal,

Will someone tell me, how I feel?

Last week I hoped for better luck,

For ’twas the Band, that we did buck,
But again we lost, now for goodness sake,
Will someone tell me where’sa lake?

But after all is said and done,

Just stick around, and watch the fun;

If we don’t finish, one-two-three, :
Will somieone tell me, where we’ll be?
