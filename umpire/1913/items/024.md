A Necessary Question.

The case had reached a critical stage.
Even the Judge seemed to awaken to a
live interest in the proceedings, for the
most important witness was about to be
cross-examined.

‘‘So you are the lady’s maid?’’ began

“Yes, sir.”’

‘“And where were you at 7 o’clock on
the evening in question?’’

“I was in my lady’s room, sir,’’

“For what purpose?’’

““I was dressing my lady’s hair, sir.”’

in the room at the time?’—Cleveland
Leader.
