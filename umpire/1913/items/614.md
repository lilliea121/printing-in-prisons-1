FIDELITY TO FRIENDS "Whatever happens, never forsake a friend. When enemies gather, when some trouble visits, when sickness falls upon the heart, when the world is dark and cheerless, is the time to try true friendship. They who turn from the scenes of distress betray their hypocrisy and prove that interest only moves them. If you have a friend who loves you, who has studied your interests and happiness, be sure to sustain him in adversity. Let him feel that his love was not thrown away. Real fidelity may be rare, but it exists in the heart of all true friends. They only deny it's worth and power for good, who never loved friend or labored to make a friend happy. â€”Pliny.
