Mrs. HorAcr Fassrrr, has sent the fol-
lowing letter in reply to the communi-
cation addressed to her last week by a
committee representing the men, which
was published in our issue of July 2:

Chestnut Hill,
July 4, 1913.
To the Committee :

The beautiful letter I re-
ceived through you in behalf of all ‘‘my boys,”’
has touched me deeply, and I thank you from
my heart, one and all of you, for its many ex-
pressions of kindness, for what was to me, a
work of the greatest pleasure. I assure you
that your hearts and hope were not more anxious
than were mine. And when the‘‘Bill,”’ became
an assured fact, and as you all wanted it, not
one of you could possibly have been happier,
and more thankful, than I was, as it has been
in my thoughts and prayers, for these many
long days and nights.

And now boys the time is coming, when you
will again go forth into the world, to take up
its burdens, and sorrows. Do try to mean to
be something. You can if you will. And re-
member always that the greatest sorrow you
can bring to e, will be to hear that you have
returned to your old lives; and the greatest joy,
to know that you are good men and true, in
every seunse of the word.

Boys be strong, and of a good courage, be
not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for ‘‘the
Tord thy God will be with thee whithersoever
thou goest.” My best love and wishes go with
this to you all.

Faithfully Vours,
