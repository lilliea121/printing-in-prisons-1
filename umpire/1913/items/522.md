THE OTHER LOVE The love you had for her, my boy, Before your hopes were blasted, Was blissful, blended, fire and joy, And glorious while it lasted, One love remains for you my boy, Fixed firm, as the mountain ranges, Tis the other love the Mother love,The love that never changes. And so when things have gone amiss, And memory swings her lashes, Reminding you of some mad bliss, That turned to dead sea ashes,Like some small boy you creep back home, To find where grief assails you, The other love, the Mother love, The love that never fails you, â€”B 6290.
