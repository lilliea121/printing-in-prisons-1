CUBS AND LIBRARY TIE

July 2.
The combination of a heavy downpour

of rain, acting in conjunction with John
Henry, deprived the Library of what
should have been a well earned victory
to-day.

Tommy and Freddie of the Cubs were
opposed by Carter and Beef Trust of the
Librarians. Both pitchers twirled only
ordinary ball and had it not been for
the splendid support accorded them, the
game would have been decidedly more
prolific in the matter of runs.

In the first inning, Yeap scored the
only run for the Librarians, stealing
home by a bold dash, only made success-
ful by its effrontery.

For flve innings the Cubs only suc-
ceeded in landing two men on third base,
but, in the sixth, Freddie walloped out
a home run, tieing the game. A potrtion
of the seventh inning was played, in
which Tommy scored, by the grace of
the umpire. A heavy rain came up in
the meantime, and while play was con-
tinued until the Library had two men
out and a man on second, the downpour
refused to be ignored, and John Henry
called the game, which reverted back to
to the sixth inning, when the score was
1—1. — Mitch.CUBS AND LIBRARY TIE
