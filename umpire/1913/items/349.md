THERE are but few weeks elapse that the Umpire does not receive one or more communications, enclosing articles highly eulogistic of the Warden, and urging their publication in its columns. These requests have been invariably refused, for several reasons: (a) lack of space; (b) similarity of subject; (c) questionable propriety. We feel quite sure that the Warden understands, and fully appreciates the kindly motives which prompt those under his care, to give expression to their feelings of gratitude, but any publicity, of this kind, so frequently requested, we are equally sure, would prove only an embarrassment to so modest a gentleman: To those of our correspondents, who find their emotions of gratitude and admiration, in this connection, reaching the point of bubbling over, we suggest a personal letter to the Warden, as a most proper, and effective outlet for their surcharged feelings.
