BAND BEAT LIBRARIANS

July 9

In the fifth inning of the game b tw en
the Band and Library this aftcinoon,
every man of the Musicians took a s vat
at Mike, Jingles latest pitcher, and when
they got through, only one man had
failed to hit the ball, and five runs were
recorded to their credit. Slim also scor-
ed for them in the first, making six runs
in all.

The Librarians obtained two runs in
the second inning through errors of Josh
and Louie, but in no other inning did
one of their men reach third. Yeap
and Joe both tried it, but were caught.
Louie and Mike the opposing pitchers
each struck out five men.

Umpires Lippy and Happy; poor un-
happy Happy. Score 6â€”2. Mitch.
