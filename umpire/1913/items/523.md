WHY JOHNNY FAILED. Johnny had a little mind it was his very own, And nothing could be put into it, except by him alone, It wasn't very big it's true, but there was room inside For lots of fine things chosen, just as Johnny should decide. Mother gave to him all sorts of good advice, But Johnny never put it in, or thought about it twice. But all the wicked things the boys around the corner said Why, Johnny picked them up at once, and put them in his head: At school the teacher tried her best, to give him facts and rules, Now !—Johnny loved that Teacher, but how he hated schools. He picked up brag and vulgar slang, cheap novels too— ten deep. And filled his mind till it was like a rubbish heap. So when the day of Manhood came, when Johnny searched his mind For skill and Power it played him false, and nothing could he find, But worthless thoughts, and wicked thoughts and so he failed, alas ! Is any other boy who reads, coming to Johnny's pass ? —Spider.
