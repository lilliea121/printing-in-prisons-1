CUBS vs BAND The Cubs captured another game from the Band, Monday afternoon at the Store House grounds by a score of 5—2. Tommy and Betts, and Herman and Larry, formed the opposing batteries, but both moundsmen weakened and fell down in the third inning, allowing numerous passes. Several of these were costly, and materially detracted from the interest in the game from the fan's point of view. The game was featureless, with the exception of Herb's work both in the field and at the bat, while Joe, for the Cubs, distinguished himself by a clean double play in the fourth. Both teams need a change of diet— preferably ginger. —Mitch.
