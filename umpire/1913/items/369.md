LIBRARY LOSE TO CUBS July 5. The Cubs and Library met this afternoon to determine the winner of the tie game of last Wednesday, and the result was in favor of the former, by the score 7â€”4. The feature of the game was Carter's home-run, the first since last season, when he was a persistent swatter. Yeap also hit the ball for a merry-go-round and Beef Trust banged out a triple. The Librarians were leading up to the fifth inning, when the Cubs woke up and potted out six runs in the next 4 innings. The Bookmen landed a run in the ninth, but, could do nothing to alter the result. Umpires: Mack and Happy.
