THE VISITOR, ASSISTED BY
"MR. «B”

Most any day, from two till four, )
They come in streams through the front door
To some of us good cheer, they bring,
Some come to gaze, some come to sing.

And when they reach the Center floor,
" In groups of two, and sometimes more,
And ask if they, the sights may see,

The ‘‘Cap” he rings for Mr. “‘B.”

Now ‘“‘Mr B,”" he looks the part,
He knows his little ‘‘spiel’’ by heart,
And gives it, in tones clear and loud,
As through the place, he shows the crowd

“Now on the left, you folks will see,
The fourth Block, and the gal-ler-y,

The men all work, and earn their pay,
They save it for some future day.”

“We have an orchestra, and band,
Believe me Miss, the music’s grand,
And every week the boys get cake,
That in this cook-house, prisoner s bake.”

“Now these are Blocks, number 8 and 9.
And over here the men do fine,

They work on stockings, made by hand,
The best you’ve seen in all the land.”

“Now folks, there’s nothing more to see,
The men you note. are getting tea,

I trust you've all enjoyed my talk
The gates’ right down that cement walk.”

Then slowly back goes ‘‘Mr B”
The first Block, then he serves their tea,
His daily task he’s nobly done,
But he will tell you, it’s only fun.
