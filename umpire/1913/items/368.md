Stocking Shed vs BandJuly 2The Stocking Shed is a much stronger team than when we last saw them out, and today they toyed with the Band in such admirable style, that at the finish they had registered another shutout to their credit. Their new twirler ‘The Rabbi"' officiated in a most creditable manner, and put them over squarely in the groove. Their batting was excellent, and in the field they were as nimble as cats on hot bricks. Big Six was in fine form, and as well as scoring, doubling and trebling with terrific clouts and bringing in several runs, he made two bold bids for victory, but was thrown out at the plate. The seven runs were subscribed by Jimmy (2,) Fingers (2,) John, Big Six, and the reliable Midget Spetz. Louie pitched for the Band but it was evidently not his day to shine. He issued several free passes, which in some cases led up to runs, Josh by extremely quick fielding, caught Big Six within a foot of the disc. Baltimore trebled and faded and but for that play, the Shed allowed them nothing resembling a run. Rain came and caused a hurried retreat leaving the game stand 7-0 favor of Stocking Shed. —Henry.
