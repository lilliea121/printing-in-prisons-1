THE WARDEN received a letter the other day from an elderly couple, stating that they wished to contribute something toward the pleasure of any men in the institution who were entirely alone and friendless, and requesting the name of any such. The Warden could not recall any, but, the Chaplain remembered that there was just one man in the whole place who appeared to be so distressingly situated, and his number was sent to the generous couple. There are loads and loads of good people in this good old world.
