CUBS vs BAND

Friday May 23

The Cubs handed the Bandits a dose
of usual foregone ‘‘conclusion’ 5-0.

Sweeney pitched for the losers and
beld opposing batters hitless for a short
time; then the slug brigade opened a
wide gap. Larry caught well. Herb
and Freddy worked like a machine.
Herb pitched championship ball. We
are hoping that the bandits will win an-
other game so we can dole out the meed
of praise that will mark an epoch in
ballistic slang writing. —Rocky.
