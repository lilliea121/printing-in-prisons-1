BRENNEN REVERSED President Lynch has reversed the ruling of Umpire Brennen,by which the New York—Philadelphia game of last Saturday was declared forfeited to the former. Lynch in his order, says Brennen was beyond his authority in declaring the game forfeited, for which action he had no playing rule or ground rule to govern him. "The game will be counted in the records for Philadelphia, 8—6, the score when the game was stopped in the ninth inning through the error of the umpire." The decision of President Lynch gives widespread satisfaction.
