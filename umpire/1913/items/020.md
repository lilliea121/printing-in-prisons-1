BASE BALL IS BRED.

WHAT is the exhilarating intoxicant
with which the Southern atmo-

sphere seems pregnant in the pro-
ducing of great ball players? Ty Cobb,
Tris Speaker, Joe Jackson, and Claude
Cooper, the recent great find of the New
York Giants, all hail from below the
Mason and Dixon line, and each and
every one of them is a star which abso-
lutely scintillates in the baseball firma-
ment. Are climatic condition responsi-
ble for better and faster players in the
South than in the North? Or what is
it? The best explanation in relation to
this situation was made to mée by Frank
Newhouse, now umpiring on the Pacific
coast. Newhouse said :

“You know it gets so awful hot in
Texas, and elsewhere in the South, that
a sort of mist or heat cloud arises from
the ground. The man who can bat well
in those leagues, can bat anywhere on
earth, for it takes a better eye to hit the
ball accurately in the South, than it
does in the North. 'That’s why men like
Cobb, Speaker and others, prove such
sensations when in the big leagues.’’

‘Whether this is the correct solution or
not, we leave to those who read to decide.
Certain it is that the explanation carries
some merit with it, and who knows but
this umpire has correctly sized up the
situation ? All the great stars coming
from the leagues in the South, proved
themselves fine ball playersin the Ameri-
can and National leagues. True, they
are not all Ty Cobbs, Speakers or Jack-
sons, but they are good enough to hold
their own anywhere. — Exchange.BASE BALL IS BRED.
