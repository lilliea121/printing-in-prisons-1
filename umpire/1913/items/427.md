BOOKIES CRUSHED Ninth Administer Severe Drubbing Show No Mercy The Ninth Block administered a most crushing defeat in which they showed no mercy, to the demoralized Librarians in the opening game of the series last Monday. They started to work in the first inning by pounding the Bookmen's slab artist, Mike all over the grounds for a single, three doubles and a triple, and never stopped until ten men had taken a whack at the ball and six runs scored. Mike held them down until the fourth, when he again blew up, allowing. nine men to face him for one single, two doubles and a three bagger and one home run (Eggie) with a total of five runs. Charlie then went in with the result that Betz, Eggie and Rube each hit him for home runs. The Librarians scored one run by Bob, who was given his base, stole second and third, and home on Beef Trust's hit. Longie allowed five hits, one a three bagger by Jore, who was back in form and playing like Sunny Jim. All of the Ninth's men distinguished themselves in the run making fiesta,excepting Bill,who went in as a pinch hitter to get some of the big percentage pie being passed along, but unfortunately was overlooked, as he struck out. Score 14—1l. Umpire, Mack, — Mitch.
