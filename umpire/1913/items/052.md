THE HONEST MAN

Honesty—A dishonest man is not sue-
cess anywhere. He may win for awhile,
but it’s the long run that counts. It’s
the final rewards in life that we are
aiming for, and the handicap of reputa-
tion for anything but absolute squareness
is not overcome, not at least, this
side of the grave.
Curly has a ball this year called the
rice soup twist— Nothing in it.

We notice Guard Myers sporting two
brand new Overseer’s stripes on his coat
sleeve— What of that? Mr. Wilkinson
has enough to go all over the house.
