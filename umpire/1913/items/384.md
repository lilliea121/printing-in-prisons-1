WILL SOMEONE TELL ME Sometime ago, I thought how fine, ‘Twould be to get a team in line, That really knew just how to play. Will someone tell me, does it pay? We'll The first day came, my pitcher fell, For many days, he won't be well. My other star, his finger broke, Will someone tell me where's the joke? I traded Eggie for Yeap, you know, And he's the boy that sure can throw, But he's all in, this awful heat, Will someone tell me, can this be beat? My other players are O. K., To field and hit they know the way, But somehow we can't win a game, Will someone tell me, am I to blame? The Ninth they surely had to fight, They played the game with all their might. My boys, they too, were on the spot. Will someone tell me, how to get on top? The Cubs were next, we thought we'd win, But we got ‘‘ours'', it was a sin, We simply could not hit that Teal, Will someone tell me, how I feel ? Last week I hoped for better luck, For 'twas the Band, that we did buck, But again we lost, now for goodness sake, Will someone tell me where's a lake? But after all is said and done, Just stick around, and watch the fun; If we don't finish, one-two-three, Will someone tell me, where we'll be? —Jingles.
