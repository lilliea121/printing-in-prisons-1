WITH THE POETS DON'T FORGET YOUR OWN Speaking of a person's faults, Pray don't forget your own. Remember those with homes of glass, Should never throw a stone. If we have nothing else to do, But talk of those who sin, ‘Tis better you commence at home, And from that point begin. You have no right to judge a man, Until he is fairly tried. Should you not like his company, You know this world is wide. Some may have faults, and who has not? The old as well as young, Perhaps you may, for aught I know, Have fifty, to their one. Til tell you of a better plan, And find it works full well. Try your own defects to cure, Before of others' tell. And though I sometimes hope to be, No worse than some I know, My own shortcomings bid me let, The faults of others go. Then let us all when we commence, To slander friend or foe, Think of the harm one word may do, To those we little know. Remember curses sometimes like Our chickens, "roost at home," Don't speak of others faults until We have none of our own. —B 6290
