"DUCKY” THE WHOLE SHOW

The Stocking Shed and the Plasterers
played off their tie game on Tuesday,
the 27th, ult, and it was a severe mauling
for the former. Although the Plasterers
made a host of runs, eredit must not be too
seriously attached to their good playing.

The hero of the game was unques-
tionably a little fellow by the name of
“Ducky.” He was the whole cheese,
and virtually played the game alone.
He pitched splendid ball but his support
was abominable, and with everything
against him; he struck eleven men out
in grand style, also he got to third base
very cleverly where he faded through no

fault of his own.

We were always in possession of the
knowledge that “Ducky’’ was an ardent
devotee of Base Ball, but not till lately
did we realize that he has no peer inside
these walls. He made some brilliant
catches and altoge:her he was the talk
of the town. The result was 9—1 which
solitary run was made by Jack in the
shape of a home run.

— Henry.
