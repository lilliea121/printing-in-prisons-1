According to Quig, Overseer Goldsmith of the Stocking Shed, has been overheard to express his sorrow that the "Yanigan" ball team did not take their place in the E. S. P. League to represent the Stocking Shed. He claims that with their remarkable playing they would have had very little if any difficulty in bringing the 1913 pennant to keep company with the one of 1911, which hangs in the shed.
