THE PAIN KILLER

““‘Some people are born great; others
achieve greatness; and still others have
it thrust upon them. It took ‘‘Billy”’
Muldoon, something like ten years to
build up a name for his place at White
Plains. It was yeas before Doc Mynon
in advertising before he began to show
results. But we have a man in our
midst who gained fame overnight, and
today he is the only authorized extermi-
nater of pain, aches and rheumatic dis-
orders of all descriptions. An unassum-
ing young man, flitting hither and hith-
er, bent upon his daily task of removing
pain. You no doubt have often met
him on his travels through the place. A
dark swarthy fellow, and at the first
glance would be taken for a Mexican or
a Spaniard, but upon closer inspection
you will notice a wide mouth, inlaid with
two solid rows of ivory, lop-eared, and
with a hungry expression always on his
face  “Why it’s “‘Monk’’, you’ll say.
Of course it is; we’re sure you knew it
all the time. You know, to begin at the
beginning; that ‘‘Monk’’, got his start
from the Ninth Block Club. Last year,
during one of the important games,
“Bill"’, the off-side-hurler of the Ninth,
while pitching a game against the Giants,
was seized with a pain in his arm, which
' pain extended from above the elbow,
through the spinal verum, (medical
term; ‘““Monk, and Jack the nurse, un-
derstands what it means), and stopped
at the back of his left ear. The Ninth
Block team were in a quandry; their best
pitcher incapacitated, two more games
to be played with the Giants, and they
only three games away from first place.
Things looked black, when someone
suggested ““Monk”’; and when he came,
things became still blacker. He looked
the arm over with a ecritical eye, and
then slowly led ‘“Bill’”’ away.

The game then proceeded with anoth-
er pitcher in the box. Hardly had the
new pitcher been warmed up. when a cry
was heard from the crowd, and ‘Bill”’
came running back, demanding to be put
back in the box. In some mysterious
way, ‘‘Monk’’ had resorted the arm  to
its original fitness; and to .this day,
“Bill’> has never had any- more trouble
with it. From then on, ‘‘Monk’s’’ for-
tune was made.
er practicing on the Story House grounds,
was hit on the head by a wildly thrown
ball, but ‘“Monk’’ was on the job, and
immediately took the pain away. Soon
after he left, they discovered that he also
took a glove, two balls, and a pair of sus-
penders belonging to ¢‘Big Six’’.THE PAIN KILLER
