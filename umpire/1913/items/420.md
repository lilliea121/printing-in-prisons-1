Jore is losing snap. Tommy of the Cubs is the only pitcher in the league who grows stronger with each inning, and finishes as fresh as when he started. It is noticed that when Yeap hits the ball good and hard, he races around bases without giving any further attention to it, evidently depending upon the coachers to notify him when to quit running. He has converted many two-baggers into three, and home-runs, by this method.
