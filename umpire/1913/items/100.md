ANOTHER DREAM.

AFTER boxing with three mutton stews,
I rolled in bed to take a snooze.
Thought came slow, and snores came thick,
Soon as I hit the old ‘‘stir’’ tick.
Troubles of earth soon slipped away,
And dreams came to me that seemed like play.
I saw a palatial train standing by,
And heard the conductor’s ever welcome cry ;
““All aboard, for Sunshine Port !
This train goes to the summer resort,
Where care is shattered and hearts are free.’’
I saw him point direct at me,
So I got aboard to taste of pleasure’s cup—
When a bold, bad runner yelled, ‘‘Water up !”
—R ocky
