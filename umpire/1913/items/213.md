LIBRARY LOSES TO CUBS

The Cubs met the Librarians, their
competitors for third place honors last
Thursday afternoon and walloped them
good and plenty by the score, 5-1.

The game was uneventful, and went
through in jig time, without a wrangle
of any kind. Both Tommy and Yellow
handed out some hot ones for their re-
spective teams. The former being cred-
ited with eight strike-outs and the latter
six. Both men had unusually good sup-
port. ‘

The Librarians opened the session by
Jimmie scoring on Bans three-bagger,
and that was the sum total of their runs,
though in two subsequent innings they
had men left at third. Yellow distin-
guished himself by a clever running catch
of Freddie’s fly.

For the Cubs, But lined out a home
run in the second, but, there wasnothing
doing by either team in the third and
fourth. In their half of the fifth how-
ever, the Cubs found the ball which net-
ted them two runs; and again in the
sixth, through opportune hits by But,
and Betts, tallied two more, and copped
the game.

Lippy umpired the game without a
protest. — Mitch.
