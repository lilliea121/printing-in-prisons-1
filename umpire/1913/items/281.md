FIRE CRACKERS

There will be a real ‘‘ sane Fourth’’
in MacKentieville alright, alright.

No order on the store-keeper for
Fourth of July erackers will be honored.
Application should be made to the diet
kitchen.

Among the pyrotechnics to be displayed
here will be one of an oratorical nature,

but confined to the intimates of the

Preacher, fourth gallery.

Aleck, of the boiler house promises
something brilliant in the way of vocal
fireworks to be accompanied by an extra
strong odor of brimstone.  He is an ex-
pert in this line ordinarily, and when he
exerts himself the result should be a
masterpiece.

Always use noiseless cartridges.
