In the last issue of the UMPIRE, it was announced that the Cubs were to be managed by ‘‘Jimmy’’, of the Writer’s Room, but unfortunately for the Cubs, this gentleman had been signed as a player by the Library, previous to his contract with the Cubs. However, ‘“‘Marty’’, a member of last year’s Stogies, has accepted the berth, and if he exhibits as much enthusiasm in playing the game as he does in securing equipment to play with, the Cubs will not have lost by the change.
