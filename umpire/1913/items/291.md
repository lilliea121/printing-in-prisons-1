BAND SLAUGHTERED

June 27 -
In a fairly well contested -game that
was badly marred by unnecessary wrang-
ling, the Cubs downed the Band to-day
by the score 7—1.
. The Musicians used both Louie and
Ban, in the box, but, the Cubs hit lgot11 of
them at will, and aided by the generally
poor work of the Band, had no trouble in

winning, hands down.
