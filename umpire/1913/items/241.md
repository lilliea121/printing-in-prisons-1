PLAYERS TO REST THIS WEEK

Owing to the extremely hot weather,
and the crippled condition of so many
of the players, the Warden has very
wisely determined that they should take
the present week for a well-earned rest,
and endeavor to recuperate from the ef-
fects of their strenuous work of the past
two weeks.

The games of next week will be played
as scheduled. The three games of the
present week will be played as the op-
portunity offers, throughout the seasou,
which will now close October 3, instead
of September 26.
