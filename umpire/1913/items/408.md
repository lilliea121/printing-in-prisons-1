WHO'S WHO In MacKentieville. Who loafs around from morn till night, making bluffs at fixing our electric light ? ‘Who paints our eyes, and punches our head, till we sure wish that he were dead ? Who bangs poor Rube till he has fits, then whacks brother Bill with both of his mitts? Who tries to give all balls, a home-run clout, and still keeps at it, when he strikes out ? Who's classed among those who can't "come back"? Why that Lombard street gent,—that great Big Jack.
