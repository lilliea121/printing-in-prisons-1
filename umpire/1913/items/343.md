THE TWO BOOTBLACKS
(To be read fast.)

Two bootblacks, one white and one
black, were standing on a corner doing
nothing, when the white bootblack
agreed to black the black bootblack's
boots.

The black bootblack was willing to
have his boots blacked by his fellow
bootblack, and the bootblack who agreed
to black the black bootblack’s boots
went to work.

When the bootblack blacked one of
the black bootblack’s boots, the boot-
black who agreed to black the black
bootblack’s boots refused to black the
other boot of the black bootblack unless
the black bootblack, who consented to
have the white bootblack black his boots,

I should add five cents to the amount the

white bootblack made blacking other
men’s boots.

This the bootblack whose boots had
been blacked refused to do, saying he
didn’t care whether the boot that the
bootblack had’nt blacked was blacked or
not.

This made the bootblack who blacked
the black bootblack’s boot angry as a
bootblack often gets, and he spit upon
the blacked boot of the black bootblack.

This roused the passions of the black
bootblack, and he proceeded to boot the
white bootblack with the boot which the
white bootblack who had refused to
black the unblacked boot of the black
bootblack, blacked the black bootblack’s
visionary organ, and in which the black
bootblack wore all the blacking off his
blacked boot in booting the white boot-
black. —Selected.THE TWO BOOTBLACKS
