WHY DID BROWNIE QUIT ?

Beginning shortly, the readers of the
UwmpIRE will learn why Brownie, one of
the clever carpenters employed by Mr.
Gillespie, quit playing in the Yanigan-
Mutt game on Tuesday. If present
plans with the Editor of the UwMPIRE
materialize, three chapters will be print-
ed each week. He says his story will
run for fifteen weeks, twelve of which
will be devoted as to what he thinks of
Kel as a pitcher. Brownie played error-
less ball, not having his hands on it
once. At one time he was playing first
base surrounded only by his whiskers,
but Kel threw to him to catch a runner,
and Brownie got mad, and told Kel nev-
er to throw anything at him again. He
walked once and stole second, and was
a foot away from third, when he evident-
ly forgot something and went back to
second for it. An elderly man, about 70
years of age, played third base for the
Yanigans in a remarkable manner.

The game was umpired by Tommy, of
the Cubs, who between bites off of a
sandwich, announced his decisions. A
rooter for the Mutts claimed that the
sandwich was given to the umpire by
Quig., but this, a rooter of the Yanigans
stoutly denied; insisting if the Kid had a
sandwich he would eat it himself.— Tim.WHY DID BROWNIE QUIT ?
