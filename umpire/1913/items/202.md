There was a small news item in these
columns last week, noting the kindly act
of an unknown young lady in present-
ing a number of steamer chairs to the
inmates of the tuberculosis ward of this
institution, and expressing the grati-
tude of the men so favored. .

This is only one instance of many thou-
sands of acts of kindness, which are
constantly being performed throughout
the world by whole-hearted, symphathi-
zing men and women. The expression
‘“‘acts of kindness’’ is used in contradis-
tinction to the word charity, the mere
mention of which, jars so unpleasantly
upon the ears of many sensitive persons,
and really does not convey the real feel-
ing or purposes of those who are but
seeking a natural outlet for
abundant good nature.

The presentation of the chairs was an
act of kindness, inspired wholly by a
deep sympathy for the afflicted men,
and a desire to add to their comfort.
The knowledge that she has done so, is
the only reward expected by this young
lady. 8o it is, with many, many others.

Men who have achieved distinction
through the amassing of great wealth,
are continually being assailed for their
lack of humanity, yet, but few peo-
- ple know of the extent, nor of the num-
ber of their kindly acts, for they give
according to the Biblical injunction.

Carnegie and Rockefeller have each
given away nearly $150.000.000, in their
efforts to benefit humanity according to
their ideas, yet their actions do not meet
with favor because the multitude can-
not see that as individuals, they are not
at once benefitted by so many dollars

in pocket. The act of kindness is there
nevertheless.

their

American institutes of learning have
been endowed with fabulous sums by
thousands of people. The thought up-
permost in the minds of the donors be-
ing, to plant a seed, a rare new seed in
some branch of knowledge, that would
fructify and multiply for the perpetual

good of all. Maybe not for you and I,
but for our progeny through generations
to come.

Acts of kindness are not rare. The
world is full of them, and it is a pleas-
ure to note that many are seen and heard
of within these walls, participated in,
alike by both officials and inmates.

Don’t be afraid to help the other fel-
