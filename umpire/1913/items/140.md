BAND vs NINTH

The Poet puta young, unknown pitch-
er in the box on Wednesday, and he had
two strikes over on the first batter up
for the Ninth, and then the batter hit
safe, and the Poet took the pitcher out.
That’s a record. One batter knocking a
pitcher out of the box. The ‘‘Ancient
Mariner,”” or better known as Ship-
wreck, was then substituted, and after
cruising around in uncharted waters for
two innings, settled down and pitched
fairly good ball. The Poet, at short, did
very good, getting a number of balls off
the back wall. Josh was the only one
who could do anything with Bill’s pitch-
ing; the rest of the team not hitting a
ball beyond third base. Chick, the
umpire in the field, fell asleep five min-
utes after four, and the second baseman
of the Ninth, awakened him five minutes
to five. The only feature connected
with the game, was the pitching of Bill;
he making ten of the Band men fan the
breeze. - TimmieBAND vs NINTH
