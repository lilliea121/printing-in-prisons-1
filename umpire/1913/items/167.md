BAND vs NINTH The Poet put a young, unknown pitcher in the box on Wednesday, and he had two strikes over on the first batter up for the Ninth, and then the batter hit safe, and the Poet took the pitcher out. That's a record. One batter knocking a pitcher out of the box. The ‘‘Ancient Mariner,'' or better known as Shipwreck, was then substituted, and after cruising around in uncharted waters for two innings, settled down and pitched fairly good ball. The Poet, at short, did very good, getting a number of balls off the back wall. Josh was the only one who could do anything with Bill's pitching; the rest of the team not hitting a ball beyond third base. Chick, the umpire in the field, fell asleep five minutes after four, and the second baseman of the Ninth, awakened him five minutes to five. The only feature connected with the game, was the pitching of Bill; he making ten of the Band men fan the breeze. --Timmie
