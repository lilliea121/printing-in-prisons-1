AMID GRIM WALLS

Within these grim and fearsome walls,
Where sunlight rarely ever falls,

Are men entombed, sad and alone,
Torn from parents, wife and home.

Within every true and loyal home,
Peace and joy may serenely reign,

While within these vaults of stone,
Abide loads of sorrow, loads of pain.

Tis hard indeed for us to know,
That by the firelits evening glow,

Await for us a friend so dear—
With welcome home, and all good cheer,
But harder still, for them to know,

That to their loved ones, they cannot go.

When restored to liberty again
Let us go forth with might and main,

To do what’s good and right and true,
Determined whatever, no wrong to do,

Iet us show the world that we have learned,
A lesson dear, that cannot be spurned.

When we shall leave these walls behind,
With this resolve firm in our mind,
And to our Saviour bow our knee,
And to him make our humble plea,
He sure will give us a helping hand,
And prove to us our dearest friend.
