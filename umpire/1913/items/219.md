It is a pleasure to note that while
the games of the past week were mostly
of an exciting nature and vigorously
contested, there was an entire absence
of anything pertaining to ‘‘rowdyism,”’
or individual animosity. Stalling is still in
vogue to some extent, and reprehensible
only an account of the limitation of time.
While every praise is deserved by the three
leaders in the race, the Band is also de-
serving credit by reason of the invariable
good nature of its members, and the
cheerful alacrity with which they come
forward for defeat.

It is with deep regret that the UMPIRE
announces the resignation of ‘‘Rocky’’
from its staff of regular contributors.
He states, that it is his intention to de-
vote all of his spare time in the future
to the writing of a play, and as we have
no desire to encroach upon time, to be
so valuably employed, we have accepted
his resignation. Vale ‘‘Rocky!”’

A great deal of interesting matter has
beer crowded out of this issue to make
room for the unusually large number of
base-ball reports.
