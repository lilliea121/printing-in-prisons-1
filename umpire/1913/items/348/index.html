<p>LIBRARIANS BEAT BAND</p>
<p>July 11</p>
<p>The Band and Librarians came togeth-
er to-day for the final game of their ser-
ies, and fought it out for seven full in-
nings resulting in a victory for the Jin-
glers by the score of 4—1.</p>
<p>In the exuberance of his joy, Jingles
fell from the Store-house steps, and
when he recovered himself, it was notic-
ed that he was much taller than prior to
the game.</p>
<p>The Librarians had traded Yeap, for
Ban J. of the Band, and both men re-
presented their respective clubs in the
box, in a manner that showed that the
exchange was to their liking, for they
excelled their previous performances.</p>
<p>The game was well contested through-
out, and up to the seventh inning when
the score stood 2—1 in favor of the Book-
men, was ever doubtful. In the last
inning however, two runs came rushing
in for the Jingles bells and the game
cinched.</p>
<p>Bill a new one, essayed to umpire the
bases, and did fairly well up to the four-
th inning, when he called a Bandman
out at third, who was palpably safe, and
notwithstanding the kicks, refused to
change his decision. Bill says, ‘‘ a um-
pire has to stand for some awful insualts
from players who can’t do as good.””</p>
<p>Maybe the Librarians have struck
their winning gait, and someone will be
able to answer Jingles’ queries in an-
other column. — Bill.</p>
