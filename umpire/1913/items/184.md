"The Greatest of These is Charity”

While a party of visitors were being
guided through the prison by the War-
den, a young lady was unable, as she.
admiringly gazed at the neat little truck
garden that gives a touch of nature to
the T. B. yard’s desolation, to repress
the flood of sympathy that overwhelmed
her. Being assured by the Warden that
any appropriate gift is appreciated by
prisoners, the young lady said no more,
and the Warden thought no more of it.

A few days later, a dozen handsome
steamer chairs—morris style—arrived,
and sick hearts were made glad. Sun-
shine and fresh air, the germ killers,
Nature’s Materia Medica, will have great-
opportunity to build up that which dis-
ease has ravaged. ‘The unknown donor

is heartily thanked. — Rocky."The Greatest of These is Charity”
