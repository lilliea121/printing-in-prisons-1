The Honest ManHonesty-A dishonest man is not success anywhere. He may win for awhile, but it's the long run that counts. It's the final rewards in life that we are aiming for, and the handicap of reputation for anything but absolute squareness is not overcome, not at least, this side of the grave.Curly has a ball this year called the rice soup twist-Nothing in it.We notice Guard Myers sporting two brand new Overseer's stripes on his coat sleeve-What of that? Mr. Wilkinson has enough to go all over the house.
