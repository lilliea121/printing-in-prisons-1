Some Aspirants for Cabinet Positions.

IGNACIO CRABFLAKE had expect-
ed to be Wilson’s Secretary of State, be-
cause he once gave the President a match
~ when his pipe went out.

- GUSTAV NICOTINE whose father

was Wilson’s barber, says it is no more
than right that he should have been ap-
pointed Postmaster-General.

TOBIAS FIERCE the house decora-
tor, who is an old friend of Wilson’s
Cousin, expected to land the job of Sec—
retary of the Interior.

It was whispered that OSCAR PIC-

KLESAUER would hold down Secre- |l :
| His type of imagery was remarkable.

| He could dig the Panama Canal with a

tary of the Treasury. He once shared
a banana with Wilson when they were
boys together.

CICERO MacSAUSAGE was spoken
of vigorously for Secretary of War.
Mr. Wilson owes him a debt of gratitude
for loaning him his umbrella one day
when it looked like rain.

LLEWELLYN J. FLOUNDER’S —
friends believed he had the Attorney-
General’s job cinched. Mr. Wilson show-
ed his friendly feeling toward Flounder

some years ago, when he allowed him to
hold his horse.
