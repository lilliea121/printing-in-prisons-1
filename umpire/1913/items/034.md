CAN YOU SOLVE IT ?

The following puzzle in figures has
been given out during the week. It’s
about two crowds of ten men who walked
into a cafe, each buying a round of five
cent drinks, as per the sample. The ex-
ample is six men buying a round each at
the single cost of thirty cents per round,
or $1.80 in all, while four purchase for
themselves at cost per round of twenty
cents, or eighty cents in all, making a
total of $2.60. The other ten divided
equally, five buying five rounds at twenty
five each, or $1.25 in all, making the
gross on their double purchases $2.50.
It works out in figures like this.

6 x 5--30 x 6 $1.80
4 x 5--20 x 4 $ .80
260
b x 5--25 x b $1.25
bux-H-=2b%% ib $1.25
—— $2.50
The mathematicians want to know

why two sets of ten men by buying ten
rounds of drinks for each party at a uni-
form price of five cents per drink should
show a difference of ten cents in the
totals.
