JINGLE BELLS NOT IN IT

uly 3
: The Cubs gave the Library another
gentle shove toward the bottom, to-day
when they defeated the Jingle bells by
the score of 6—2. The Cubs' simply
toyed with their opponents and won as
they pleased. The Library is badly
handicapped by the lack of able pitchers,
and until this defeot is remedied, must
be satisfied to hug tight to last place.
Jingles, their manager, makes a pathetic
plea for both pa.tience‘a,nd encouragement
on the part of the fans, and prophesies
that his men will yet make good.

— Bill.
