BAND vs SHED

June 30

The Shed could not hold the Band
down; somehow they seemed to have a
terrific burst of speed in their playing
to-day. With Big ILouie on the mound
for the Band, and Herman, and the Rab-
bi for the Shed, there was a pitchers bat-
tle. Jimmy of the Shed had a brilliant
two-base hit, scoring two men on it, and
later scoring himself. Big Slim excel-
led for the Band, both at the bat and in
the field. The biggest sensation of the
game was Josh, sliding half-way from
second to third, amid a cloud of dust.
Later, Big Six tried the same stunt, but
he was not as slippery as Josh, and was
caught a foot from the sack. Score 6-—4
Umpires—Happy, Ken. — DBill.BAND vs SHED
