LIBRARY LOSE TO CUBS
July s.

The Cubs and Library met this after-
noon to determine the winner of the tie
game of last Wednesday, and the result
was in favor of the former, by the score
T—4.

The feature of the game was Carter’s
home-run, the first since last season,
when he was a persistent swatter. Yeap
also hit the ball for a merry-go-round
and Beef Trust banged out a triple.
The Librarians were leading up to the
fifth inning, when the Cubs woke up
and potted out six runs in the next 4 in-
nings. The Bookmen landed a run in the
ninth, but, could do nothing to alter the
result. Umpires: Mack and Happy.

Big Six, the Shed’s catcher, who has
been transferred several times this sea-
son, was finally released this morning to
Connie Mack’s bunch of beauties.
