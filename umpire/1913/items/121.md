PLASTERERS vs CUBS
April 30

A great game was cooked, dished, and
served up all piping hot to day, by the
Cubs to the Plasterers. They gave them
a good run for their meney, and so close-
ly did they hang on to each other, that
it was impossible to determine, with any
certainty, which team would be return-
ed the winner until the whistle sounded.

Again Dave had to keep his eyes open,
and have all his wits about him; and
it was easy to see that he realizes he
must not lose one game to any of the
minor teams, if he entertains any hope
of winning the coveted trophy.

Everybody on the field enjoyed every
moment of the time the game was in
progress, including our worthy league
president, who we could observe was out
to encourage the weaker teams. His
policy is the right one, and we hope ere
long to see the fans go his way also.

The loss of balls was disastrous, and
we heard Curly casually remark, that it
would be necessary to have a millionaire
on their staff if, this state of affairs con-
tinued. Fifteen balls were logt today.

Our special attention was drawn to
the Umpire ‘‘John Henry’’. Hesure is
the right man in the right place; no kick
or protest of any kind ruffles his genial
disposition, for he exercises his own judg-
ment, is governed by that alone, and
allows nothing else to influence his
decision.

He is the personification of good humor
and good temper, and by this he com-
mands the respect of the community.

Tony pitched for the Plasterers, and
held his own down well; Kidney officia-
ted for the Cubs and did likewise; and by
the way, thisis the young fellow to
whom we drew attention in last week’s
UmPIRE, when we remarked that ‘‘we
noticed in particular one player, who
was coming to the front by leaps and

bounds,”” his name was unfortunately
omitted on that occasion.

Our friend Herb, for the Cubs, started
the ball rolling with a home run; several
excellent plays were made

It is with the -greatest pleasure that
we are able to record the continued
splendid behavior of all parties concerned
in the games, and we are perfectly sat-
isfied in our own mind that the Warden’s
confidence in the men was not misplaced.
It is most agreeable to notice them stand-
ing around in groups watching the games,
and discussing various topics of interest,
in a rational and most sensible spirit.PLASTERERS vs CUBS
