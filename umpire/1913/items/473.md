CUBS AND BAND TIE AGAIN A game attended with good nature and humor, was played today, between the above teams, every minute of which was enjoyable, and resulted in a tie, of 2—2. A new champion has arisen in the person of Ike, who appears to be the idol of his team, and he caught today's game in grand form. On two occasions he shone conspicuously, when he caught Freddy and Marty, a foot from the plate, in the act of stealing. In the 1st inning, Roge and Poet scored on passed balls, but that powerful combination, Tommy and Freddy, held them down ever afterwards. Why the Cubs' manager did not use Freddy in the 1st inning, probably will never be known, but it was to say the least of it, a very dangerous procedure. The Cubs scored with Charlie in the third inning, on Julius' sacrifice. Marty's failure to score was due entirely to indiscreet coaching, by which he was induced to attempt an impossibility. In the last inning, the Cubs fighting hard, managed to tally with Douglas, who was running for Timmy 2nd. He scored on a wild throw, which for the moment raised a technical protest.
