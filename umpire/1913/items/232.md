SAME BAD STALLING

June 5

A very good game of base ball hetween
the Library and Cubs was sadly marred
in the last inning when the game stood
3-1 in favor of the Librarians, by some
pretty rank stalling on the part of Jim-
my’s cohorts,

The Cubs had three men on bases and
none down, when the bell strﬁ(tk, and
had the game been hustled along as it
should have been, there would probably
have been a different result.

It is understood that the Cub’s man-
agement will enter a protest.  —Mitch.SAME BAD STALLING
