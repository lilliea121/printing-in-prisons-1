NINTH vs CUBS

April 9

The Cubs and the Ninth lined up for
their second game last Wednesday, at
the Btore Houge grounds, The weather
was fair, but a trifle cool, However,
the boys put up the real article; both
gides doing execellent work It seemed
ag though the Cubs had decided to get
revenge for the defeat they sustained in
the opening contest Tuesday, and for a
time it looked as if they wera going to
turn the tables on the Ninth, The
Ninth went to the bat first but failed to
geore, Slick, who hit safe, and VYeap,
who walked, were hoth caught stealing,
Tim wag out on a long fly to right which

wag well fielded, by Henry of the Cubs,

In the lagt half of the first, the Cubs
toolk the lead, scoring two runs, Char-
lie walked, Woodie got to first on a
gerateh hit, and Freddie, who canght
today, slammed a dandy for two bases,
georing bhoth men on bage, That ended
the Cubs batting festival, and in the re-
mainder of the game, they failed to gcore,

In the second, neither gide scored,
Kirkie, the Cubs pitcher, was in great
form, and was well gupported by the rest
of his team. Yeap, who pitched for the
Ninth, also wag in mid-summer condi-
tion, and after the first inning never had
much trouble in keeping the Cubs bats-
men in check,

I the third, Longie and Blick, hoth
hit for the cirenit; Slick bringing in Wade
who wag resting quietly on second,  Tim-
mie's sacrifice wag well laid down, and

fetched in another run,

The work of Freddie, the Cub mask-
man, was wonderful, when we consider
' that he has never had any practice in
that position; his regular place being in
the box. Slick, the Ninth's catcher,
who relieved Augie in the first, was also
beyond reproach, and he led his side at
the bat.

When we stop and look at that Ninth
line up, and watch them warm up, we
can come to only one conclusion, that
the team who beats them, must go some,
However, the Ninth must also make up
their minds, that they are not going. to
have any lead pipe cinchin grabbing the
pennant. Get that Timmie ?

If the same article of ball that was
handed out to-day, continues, we will
not have to regret our inability to witness
the Athletics and Phils uphold the honor
of our city,

To-morrow, all teams lay off, and the
managers welcome the respite; as they
will have an opportunity to strengthen
up the weak spots, and incidentally dish
out some heart to heart talks,  Hinal
soore 6—2 favor Ninth, Time of game 67
minutes, Attendance 2004, The half
wag one of the umpirves, but I won't
mention any names, Those who know
kindly think, but refrain from doing so
out loud,
