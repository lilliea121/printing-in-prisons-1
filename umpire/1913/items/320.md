Oh! Glorious Flag!Emblem of Right, as well as Might-Thy fluttering folds to the winds unfurl'd , Heralding afar, thy message of freedom brightTo Nations great, throughout the world- Proclaiming guardianship of the lowly and oppres't,Under whose starry vigilance, o'er wrought mankind may find rest.Oh! may thy stars be ever, as firmly set, A s those in Heaven's vast firmament.-Mitch.
