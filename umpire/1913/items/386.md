WHO'S WHO In MacKentieville. Who is the man who mends our clock, and has a mortgage on the Seventh block? Who'll take a watch or clock apart, just to show you, he is some smart? Who sometimes sends it back to you, minus just a spring or wheel or two? Who when you ask, where are those wheels, just simply smiles and turns on his heels? Who fixes 'em all, no matter the make? Why that gent from Chermany, dot Herr Dutch Jake. â€”Spider.
