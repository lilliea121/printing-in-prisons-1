POLITENESS

tattered uppers go his way, and he

will gain a host of friends, as on

his toilsome way he wends. But
gents whose manners are correct, don’t
need such hardship to expect; they most-
ly tread on joyous feet, along the pave of
Easy street. For men of courtesy and
grace will find a welcome any place.
They are not turned from any door; the
merchant wants them in his store;
wherever there are high priced snaps,
there’s a demand for gracious chaps, who
have a stock of winning ways that they
have carried all their days. These fel-
lows get the bestin life ; when one goes
forth to seek a wife, the luscious damsels
fairly scrap to get their talons on that
chap. But never yet did pretty girl, dis-
tress herself to hook a churl. The
courteous man finds life a feast, for him
the good old world is greased, and when
he dies the whole blamed town turns out
to see him sodded down. These facts
are known the whole world o’er; you’d
think that men whose heads are sore
would try to profit by the same, and
quit their foolish, grouchy game. Po-
liteness makes your life serene, then
why be boorish, ugly, mean ? T'he more
you deal in sass and slack, the more the
world will hit you back.— Walt Mason.POLITENESS
