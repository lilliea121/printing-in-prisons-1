NINTH BLOCK — PLASTERERS

The first practice game of any account
took place on Wednesday, between the
Plasterers and Ninth Bloek.

“Tony’’ was tried out as a pitcher,
and with proper support would have:
held the Ninth to a closer score.
“‘Longie’’ was in the box for the Ninth,
and was in mid-season form. The
comparative strength of the clubs should
not be judged by Wednesday’s game, as
it was the first time the Plasterers have
played together as a team. A few more
games, and with their pitchers working
in regular order, the Ninth, Library or
any other team will not find it so easy.

The only run scored by the Plasterers
was a wild throw to catch ‘‘Dave’’ off
second ; ‘‘Dave’’ crossing the plate on

the throw home. Score Ninth Block 7
