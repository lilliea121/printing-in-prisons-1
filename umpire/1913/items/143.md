GOOD UMPIRE RESIGNS

Neal, who ranks with Denver Eddie
as an umpire, handed in his resignation
today without stating reasons. The
writer tried to fathom the reason, but
Neal stands pat. We mneed all juicy
base ball scandals in our business. All
players when questioned remained taci-
turn. Scandal should not be hushed up,
as exposure is good for the game.
‘When a player or umpire resigns with-
out apparant reason, you can wager that
there is a reason. When friesd or foe
deserves a ‘‘blast,’’ believe me, he will
get it. It takes more than a ball score
to make baseball news. Suspension for
high, low, cunning or rowdy play would
be beneficial all around. Beware the
dog.
