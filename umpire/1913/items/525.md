GAMES OF AUGUST 13 Plasterers vs Cubs—Ninth vs Shed -- Band vs Library PLASTERERS SHUT OUT CUBS There was a glorious battle today between Yaller of the Plasterers, and Tommy of the Cubs, when the latter were shut out by the score of 1—0, in one of the most brilliant games ever seen on these grounds. Seven full innings were played, during which, Yaller struck out nine men and allowed two hits, while Tommy struck out the same number, and was hit four times. In the first, Tony hit, and reached home on Felix' single, and it was not until the seventh, that the Plasterers succeeded in having another man reach third, where he died. The two hits made by the Cubs were singles by Herb and Woody, both reaching third, but failing to come home through the want of an opportune hit. The fielding of both teams was faultless, and abounded in sensational plays. Umpire, Mack. —Mitch.
