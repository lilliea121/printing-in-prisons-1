JUST DON'T Do you feel you'd like to quit? Don't ! Get to feeling you don't fit? Don't! Do you want to yell ‘"‘all in'"' Cause your wind's a little thin And you think you'll never win? Don't! Don't! Don't! There's a kick you want to make? There's a head you want to break? Do you feel you want to whine Like a genuine canine And send blue streaks down the line? Well, Don't! When you see a chance to duck, Don't When you want to chuck your luck, Don't ! Keep right on without a stop And you'll surely show up on top. If, just when you want to flop, You Don't! —C. L. Armstrong
