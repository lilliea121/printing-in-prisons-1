Pointed Puns

Regardless.

Molly Pitcher sprang to the gun at
Monmouth.

“Bo this,”” exclaimed the soldiery,
their imaginations instantly fired, ‘‘is
to be a Pitcher’s battle!”’ |

For, although the national game was
still on the knees of the gods, sporting
blood is sporting blood, regardless of
season or occasion. |

Why the Judge Was Powerless,

The jury, after long deliberation, seem-
ed unable to agree in a perfectly clear
case. 'The judge, thoroughly exasperat-
ed at the delay, said : |

¢TI discharge this jury.”’

One sensitive juror, indignant at what
he considered a rebuke, faced the judge.

““You can’t discharge me !”” he said,
with a tone of conviction.

““And why not ?”’ inquired the judge?
in surprise.

“‘Because,’”’ announced the juror,
pointing to the lawyer for the defence,

““TI was hired by that man there !’
