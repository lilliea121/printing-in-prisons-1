STOCKING SHED 10, BAND 7

June 5

The Stocking Shed bowled the Band
over to-day to the tune of 10-7. Bowl
Foot, a new man wentin to do the trick
for the Sheds, but when the Band jump-
ed on him for five runs in the third.
he was taken out, and Spetz whirled
the remaining innings.

Walter was not in shape and the Shed
won the game in the first two innings
when they touched him up for seven
runs. The Band is making a desperate
up-hill fight, and Dayve and his crowd
are to be commended.

They are good
losers.

â€” Mitch.
