The President reports the following changes: Yeap of the 9th, to the Library, for Eggie and Betz, to strengthen the pitching staff of the Library and give the Ninth a good catcher and a fast man on bases in Eggie. Ban J, from the Cubs to the Band for Julius the little 3rd baseman. Dutch Herman is now with the Shed team. A change of team may work wonders in Herman.
