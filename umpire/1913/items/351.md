Managers should act promptly in asserting their authority to prevent disputes between any of their players and the umpire. Upon at least two occasions last week, there were heated arguments between one of the Cubs and Happy, the umpire. Admitting the provocation was great, the player was clearly in the wrong, and usurping the duty of the manager, when he started his argument with Happy. The latter has made many errors, but, they were ‘‘of the head, not the heart,'' and his decisions, or in fact, the decisions of any umpire, if questioned. should be done so, quietly and without bitterness. The least we can do for these men, in lieu of salary, is to show respect for the positions they hold.
