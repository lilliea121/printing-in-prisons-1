CONCERT BY BOYS’ CHOIR

More than fifty little boys from the
choir of St. John’s Boys’ Orphan Asy-
lam of this city, came all the way from
48th and Wyalusing avenue, to take
part in the Sacred concert given here on
Sunday afternoon under the auspices of
the American Society for Visiting Catho-
lic Prisoners.

The program, embracing many class-
ics, was of unusual merit, and the num-
bers effectively rendered by the boys,
in their clear, sweet soprano voices, re-
flected the able manner in which they
had been trained by their master, Prof.
A. H. Heuermann.

Messrs Edward Donohue, A. Huver,
Francis Diamond and W. Kristel, were
the goloists, and their splendid efforts
were fully appreciated.

Melody reaches its height of grandeur
in the cultivated adult voice, but, can
never arouse the same tender thoughts
as that inspired by the blended harmony
of the pure sweet tones of unsullied
children.

The men are deeply grateful for the
entertainment, so thoughtfully prepared,
and so ably executed.CONCERT BY BOYS’ CHOIR
