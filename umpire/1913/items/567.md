WITH THE POETS A DREAM LETTER William has had a letter, A letter from his wife. It is filled with pleasant tidings, It has filled him with new life. For it tells of a faith unswerving, Of a loving woman's fare, 3 And of prattling little children, Biding a father's needful care. It tells of a victorious struggle, Made by a woman all alone, To preserve her little children, To provide them with a home. It tells of a love deep-rooted, Of a heart that still beats true, But— "don't awaken William, Whatever else you do." —Mitch.
