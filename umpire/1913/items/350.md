It is a pleasure to note the high character of the work now being done for the E. S. P. League by Mack, the new umpire, who but recently registered with us. He has shown a thorough familiarity with the many intricacies of the game; unquestionable honesty in his decisions, and the ability to control the players, without incurring their ill-will. He should be given the consideration that is his due by everyone interested in the success of our league.
