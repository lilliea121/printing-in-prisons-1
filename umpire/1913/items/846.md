A NICE WORD FOR THE EDITOR To the Umpire Editor:â€”As a Penal Accountant or especial Systematizer, 1 wish to say to yourself sagacity of the rejection of ridicule and criticism over "The Prison Kitchen,' that the recent figures and hieroglyphics are erroneous or ridiculously, and while the majority knows that Jingles is an inebriated Prison degenerate on levity. While Mr. being a Monumental liar and last Penal Journalism with a half-wit for an Editor, is an insidious intriguer the insane excuse for such an erring hypothesis. Hereafter, young man be careful of your four-flushing another mendacity. (Signed) AN OBSERVER.
