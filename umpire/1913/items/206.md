KINDNESS IN OUR HIDDEN CITY

Is kindness within these Gray Stone Walls,
Where we boy’s land after a serious fall ?
Of course there is; and I know it’s true
That kindness will pull the worst one through,
Take Pals, that lock in a room alone,
Some of them scrap but soon atone,
Just a cheerful word, a nice kind smile—
Then they’re pals again for quite awhile.
Kindness is great in a place like this,
And it’s something boys you’ll never miss,
A nice kind word to a pal that’s blue
How it shortens the day and helps him thro’.
And don’t forget the lifetime men
Show them a kindness whene’er you can.
Live in the present, and forget the past

Improve the future, let this be “‘your last.”
