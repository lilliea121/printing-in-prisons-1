A NEW PIPE

Mr. James Loan of the store house is
probably the only merchant in the coun-
try who is doing business on a losing
basis and fully enjoying it. He is al-
ways on the alert for opportunities to
give his customers the biggest values for
the least money, and lately has added
to his stock some genuine French briar
wood pipes with the famous ‘‘Bakelite”’
mouth piece. It is claimed that ‘‘Bake-
lite”’ is stronger and more brilliant than
amber, and that it is tasteless, odorless,
and non-inflammapble.

Its full and unusual chemical name is
Owxybenzlmethylenglycolanhydride.  If the
merits of the pipe are at all proportion-
ate to its name, then the ‘‘Bakelite,’’
has them all beaten, by several million
miles. These pipes cost $6 per dozen,
wholesale, and in keeping with his liber-
al policy, Mr. Loan is handing them out
for 50 cents each.

He has also added to his stock of
staples, a Pine Tar Soap, of the well
known Williams’ make at .05 cents and
Prophylactic tooth brushes, at 18 cents.

As the Warden has solved the most
difficult part of the high cost of living in

the matter of neecessities for us, Mr.

Loan is lending his efforts in cutting

=)
down the cost of luxuries. It is hoped

that his energies may never tire.A NEW PIPE
