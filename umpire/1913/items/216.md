"The Greatest of These is Charity" While a party of visitors were being guided through the prison by the Warden, a young lady was unable, as she admiringly gazed at the neat little truck garden that gives a touch of nature to the T. B. yard's desolation, to repress the flood of sympathy that overwhelmed her. Being assured by the Warden that any appropriate gift is appreciated by prisoners, the young lady said no more, and the Warden thought no more of it. A few days later, a dozen handsome steamer chairs—morris style—arrived, and sick hearts were made glad. Sunshine and fresh air, the germ killers, Nature's Materia Medica, will have great opportunity to build up that which disease has ravaged. ‘The unknown donor is heartily thanked. —Rocky.
