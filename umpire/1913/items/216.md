BAND WINS FROM SHED

There was rejoicing in the Band room
on Thursday night and with good reason,
for the Musicians had overcome their
must formidable opponentin the tail-end
struggle by the score 6—5. No red fire
was burnt on the campus, nor was there
noisome frivolity in the dorms. but, on
Friday they took advantage of the holi-
day to get rid of some of their pent-up
joy and blew themselves for fair at the
concert. Herman, Walter and Larry
formed the battery unmasked by the
Band while the boys from the Stocking
Shed, replied with Floyd and Spetts.
The game was well contested throughout
the full six innings, with a creditable
vigor that left the result in doubt until
the whistle blew. — Mitch.
