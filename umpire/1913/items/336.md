WHO'S WHO
In MacKentieville.

Who is the man who mends our clock,
and has a mortgage on the Seventh block?
Who’ll take a watch or clock apart, just

to show you, he is some smart? Who
sometimes sends it back to you, minus
just a spring or wheel or two? Who

when you ask, where are those wheels,
just simply smiles and turns on his heels ?
Who fixes ’em all, no matter the make?
Why that gent from Chermany, dot
Herr Dutch Jake. — Spider.
