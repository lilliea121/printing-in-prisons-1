VANDALS AT WORK AGAIN

Some unknown person, or persons un-
known, have been committing depreda-
tions in this neighborhood with frequent
regularity, to the annoyance of our best
citizens.

Last Sunday, some heartless hoodlum
had the brazen gall to break a cherished
medicine glass—same size as Mike puts
on the bar. 1t may seem a small matter
to the unconcerned, but, it took seven-
teen years to collect the half dozen that
were guaranteed to be new.  —Rocky
