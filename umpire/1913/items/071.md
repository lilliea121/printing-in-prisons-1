TY COBB CAN GET HIS PRICE

Ty Cobb, champion batsman of the
American League, may become a resi-
dent of Chicago, if he fails to come to
terms with the management of the De-
troit club, according to a telegram sent
by him from Augusta, Ga., today.

Cobb, replying to an offer of $ 15,000
a year and an automobile, to act as
Chicago agent for an automobile supply
company, of Logansport, Ind., said
that he was still negotiating with Pres- |
ident Navin, of Detroit, but would give
a definite answer to the busiuess propos-
ition within ten days.

The concern which seeks Cobbâ€™s serv-
ices recently weaned Vincent Campbell
a Boston outfielder, from basgeball and
and placed him in charge of its St. Louis
branch.
