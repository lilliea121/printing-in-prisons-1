First, third, ninth, tenth and eleventh blocks will see the games played on Ninth block grounds. Eighth block, and seventh and twelfth blocks and galleries will see the games on the Stable grounds. Fourth, fifth and sixth blocks and galleries will see the games played on the Storehouse grounds. This order applies to all men, employed or unemployed, in shops or elsewhere.
