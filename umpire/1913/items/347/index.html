<p>SHED LOSE 3 STRAIGHT</p>
<p>uly 11</p>
<p>: It was no hard matter to obtain a seat
in the grand stand to-day to see the
combat between the 9th and Shed, Dbe-
cause nearly everybody had migrated
to the Stable ground in the expectancy
of seeing the Cubs perform the hat trick
upon the old veterans, which inciden-
tally did not come to pass.</p>
<p>Longie and Duckie pitched respect-
ively and from the completion of the 1st
inning there was no chance of the Shed
winning. 13 runs were aggregrated and
10 of them wentto the Ninth’s credit;
John (3), Eggie (2), Lefty (2), Augie,</p>
<p>Longie and Betts.</p>
<p>Duckie tried his best to keep the score
down, but it was in vain that he hurled
the sphere. He with Bob and Spetz
made a trio of runs. — Henry.</p>
