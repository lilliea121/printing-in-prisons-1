BABY

DEDICATED TO LITTLE MARY

Baby in the cradle, with staring eyes of blue,
With sweetest tiny hands, and toes of pinkish hue,
Whose every little movement is brand new,
I,usty cries pronounce ker sound right through.
Tell us, little dearie, if it’s all the same to you,
Shall we name you Bessie, or just plain Sue?
We don’t like to displease, or do anything we'd rue,
So tell us if you're satisfied, please do.
In years to come, your grace and beauty will imbue
A lover's heart with tender love, a love that will be true.
And dreams may come that often, often fondly grew,
From a little, lisping baby crying, ‘‘Gooh !
—Rocky.
