THE NINTH AND PLASTERERS
BATTLE IN LIVELY GAME

April 2
’ H%] best game of the season was play-
ed to-day between the Plasterers
and the Ninth. Curly, pitching for the
Plasterers, expended too much energy,
trying to hold a man on second. He
paid the penalty for it in the third in-
ning. After that he settled down and
pitched star ball. Quick return pitching
is useless, except to catch a batter nap-

ping.

The third inning was ‘Old Home Week’
for the Ninth. Lefty was the brilliant
Cobbite, when it came to slamming the
sphere. Single, double, and home run,
was his contribution. In this third in-
ning, Brownie poled a homer, and de-
lighted the fans with a dazzling burst of
speed on the bases.

Lefty took the same. Waters rubbed
it in with another. ~Rube and Timmie
helped the good work along with a
double and single, respectively. After
that, Rube took several bites out of the
ozone. Timmie had another hit up his
sleeve. Both catchers were on their
toes all the time. TLongy controlled the
situation with speed that was terrific.
In the second, Dave, of the Plasterers,
raised the hopes of his followers by hit-
ting out a clean home run. After that
Longy stopped speeding them to him.

Toney was there with a couple of hits.

Little Dick had a chance to put kis team
on the right side of the ledger, but was
not equal to the emergency.
" Alec clouted for a home run in the
sixth. Only once was Longy in danger,
that was in the seventh, when Little
Dick, Stump, Toney and Felix, hit in
succession.

The fielding features were the close-to-
the-wall catch, by Dave, and Alec’s
great catch that spoiled a home run.

Many good hits were wasted over the
street wall.

Too many players try at the same
time, to field the ball to make the put-
out at first; it only results in confusion.
Let captain or manager call out the name
of the player who should getit. Given
a regulation diamond and all these play-

ers would put up a star brand of field-
ing. The score ,6—2

Say, you ardent fan, how would you
like to slide on those cobble stones ?
Don’t criticize too harshly. —Rocky
