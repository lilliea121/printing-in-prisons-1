Play Ten Innings Without a Score

In a ten inning scoreless battle, between Penn Varsity and a Scrub Team, the Scrub pitchers held the Varsity team two hits. Mike Doolan, the Phillies short-stop, played short-stop for the Scrubs, but failed to register a hit off the Varsity pitchers.

The Penn baseball men have never []owed up nearly so well at this early date in any previous season.
