SAID TO BE FUNNY Let us be thankful for occasional visits from the man who sees the funny side of things. In the Schoolroom— Mr. Bonsall:—Sammy, if your father borrowed $50 and agreed to pay it back at the rate of $5 a month, how long would it take him to pay? Sammy:—(confidently) It'd take him all his life, and den some more. Mr. Bonsall:—Beat it back to your cell, quick. You're the limit. Sammy:—(sadly) Ah, Teechur, you don' know my fadder. —B 62950. Some Summer Don'ts observed in MacKentieville : Don't mix your drinks. Don't drink liquor after eating. Don't drink liquor before eating. Don't eat meat and drink milk at the same meal. Don't hurt anybody's feelings; they might hurt back. Mrs. Talkington—Tell me the truth, Henry, have I a rival? Mr. Talkington—Only the phonograph, my love.
