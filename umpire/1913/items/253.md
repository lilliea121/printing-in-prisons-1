BAND SHUT OUT

Junell.

The above game was played to-day and
from its inception, when we observed
the Bandits line up, we were satisfied
that the result was a foregone conclusion.
Longy was in the box and pitched a good
strong no run game, although we observ-
ed him hit three men. His support was
good, and from the style in which they
played, we are convinced they could have
scored many more if they had been on
their real mettle. Louis pitched a fair
game for the Band, but he is no match
for the Ninth sheet anchor. The game
resulted in the Band being ‘‘Chicagoed,”’
which for those who are not acquainted
with this vernacular, represents a shut
out.

Lefty and Longy scored home runs.
The Poet singled but utterly ignored
first base. It manifested gross careless-
ness, and it appeared to us as though he
was indifferent about the issue of the
game. Rodgie got to third and glued
there; because in our opinion he had
ample time to score on the Poet’s hit.
John Henry made no secret of the fact,
that he was terrified at Loongie’s pitching,
and at times almost turned his face to
the wall. As we stated above, Longy
had ten strike outs so probably herein
hangs the sequel, which was Ninth 11
Band 0.
