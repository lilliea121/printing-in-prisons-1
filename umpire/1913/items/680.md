UMPIRE WORD CONTEST Next Wednesday, October 22 is the date set for the closing of the Word Contest, and all lists should be in by that day. While there has been quite a few received up to this time, we want to see a great many more, particularly from those who are attending school. There is no better way of familiarizing yourself with the English language, and it is also a wonderful aid in increasing your vocabulary. So get busy this week.
