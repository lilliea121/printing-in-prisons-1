THE BIG LEAGUERS The Athletics suffered a serious setback last week when the Bostons, rated as a second class team this year, came to this city and walloped Conie Mack's aspirants for championship honors for three straight games. A repetition of this sort of thing will be a reason for removing the World's series from Shibe Park to Cleveland next month. At this writing the Naps are not so far behind as to be noticeable, and it would be an unkind stroke of fate, if after leading the pennant chasers for the whole season, the Athletics should fall in the stretch and lose out. The Phillies hold the relative position to the Giants as the Naps do to the White Elephants, and are playing wonderful ball on their present trip. Much better than on their own grounds. In Boston last Friday they played two games aggregating nineteen innings and scored the only run made in the two combats. Their pitchers are in good shape, while the esprit du corps is such as to excite the keenest interest However, the New Yorkers are winning consistently, and there is little probability of the Phillies overtaking them, although it does look now as if there will be a grandstand finish.
