WHO'S WHO In MacKentievilleWho plays the shadow for Mister Larry? Is ready to work; never known to tarry. Who cuts the pot-pie with dexterous care, each slice alike, true to a hair? Who's detective work is equally as great, as that City Hall gent's, Mister Jimmy Tate? Who's deeds of valor are as many as mighty? Why, that Seventh Block gent, that long slim Whitey.
