BACK TO THE FARMSouth Dakota will have a State farm next spring, on which penitentiary convicts will be provided with work. The Board of Charities and Correction has concluded negotiations for the purchase of 240 acres just north of the prison grounds. Governor Byrne has been urging the adoption of such a system. Adjoining the 240 acres just purchased, the State has another tract of equal size. The entire 480 acres will be devoted to prison farming. Rentals on the land already in the State's possession will not expire, however, until 1916, so that the new land will not be all used until that time. The State will take possession of the new purchase on March 1. The contract with the company that purchases the output of the prison shirt factory will not terminate until July, 1915, and before that time it would not be possible to transfer any great number of prisoners from the factory and binder twine plant to the farm.
