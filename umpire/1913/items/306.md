Troere are but few weeks elapse that
the UMPIRE does not receive one or more
communications, enclosing articles high-
ly eulogistic of the Warden, and urging
their publication in its columns.

These requests have been invariably
refused, for several reasons: (@) lack
of space; (b) similarity of subject; (¢
-questionable propriety.

We feel quite sure that the Warden
understands, and fully appreciates the
kindly motives which prompt those vn-
der his care, to give expression to their
feelings 'of gratitude, but any publicity,
of this kind, so frequently requested, we
are equally sure, would prove only an
embarassment to so modest a gentleman-

To those of our correspondents, who
find their emotions of gratitude and ad-—
miration, in this connection, reachirg the
point of bubbling over, we suggest a per-
sonal letter to the Warden, as a most
proper, and effective outlet for their sur-
charged feelings.Troere are but few weeks elapse that
