A German highbrow, with an unpronounceable name, announces that after years of exhaustive study, he can now determine by the conformation of the toes of a newly-born infant, if it will grow up to be a criminal. We are now waiting to hear from another source to learn just what conformation of any other member will be required to determine the length of sentence such a child will eventually have to serve; the particular branch of crime he will choose, and more important still, if he will grow up at all.
