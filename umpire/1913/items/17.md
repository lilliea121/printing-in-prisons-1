Illustrated LectureThose who were fortunate enough to attend the Lecture on Saturday, listened to a very interesting lecture on Italy. The subject was handled in a very able manner, and covered a wide range of territory; from Genoa in the North to Naples in the South. The views shown, gave a true picture o{ life in Italy, and must have been a revelation to thosehave never traveled in other lands. The views of Lake Como were especially good, and the pictures of Mount Vesuvius awe inspiring.We noticed several Italians in the audience, and by their actions saw that they thoroughly enjoyed the familiar scenes of home life.We feel sure that every man present on Saturday, will second our thanks to the gentlemen who so generously volunteered their time to this work, and hope it will have good results in creating a desire for knowledge of the world in which we live for "Knowledge is power."We hope that in the near future it may be possible to have larger quarters for these lectures, so that more may participate in them: as we feel sure that their influence cannot be anything but helpful.
