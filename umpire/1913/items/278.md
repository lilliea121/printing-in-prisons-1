THE IRREPRESSIBLE JEW

A few years ago while cruising in
Southern waters the writer had the mis-
fortune to be in a vessel, that was fol-
lowed many miles at sea by a tremen-
dous man-eating shark. The vessel
containing besides the passengers, a lot
of Bananas, Oranges and other produce.
The shark’s actions were watched for a
considerable distance, and noting that
he was of a hungry disposition they be-
gan to feed him the produce, thinking
that then he would leave the vessel un-
molested. After everything had been
cast overboard, even including the cap-
tain’s three-legged stool, and as the
man-eater still followed, it was decided
the only way to be rid of the monster
was to feed him one of the passengers.
As none volunteered for the service, lots
were drawn for this distinction and. fell
to Ikey Goldstein, a typical New York
Je Ikey was not at all down-cast.
With a smile on his face he said he was
only too glad to go. Men, women and
children, crowded around Ikey and pro-
claimed him the greatest hero ever. After
receiving the blessings of the entire as-

semblage he leaped overboard and at
once dissapeared into the mouth of the

shark. The latter still continued to fol-
low. Seeing that serious danger was

imminent, unless something was done to
be rid of the shark the Captauin ordered
him harpooned and dragged aboard the
vessel, which was done. He was then
cut open, and all they expected to find
of poor Ikey, was a few crushed bones.
But not so, for lo, and behold, when the
shark was laid open and his stomach ex-
posed there was Ikey Goldstein, bright
as day sitting on the three legged stool,
selling bananas and oranges at five cents
a dozen. —B6290.THE IRREPRESSIBLE JEW
