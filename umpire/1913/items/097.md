PLASTERERS vs CUBS

The opening game of a series be-
tween the above teams was played to-

day, and a very decent game result-
ed. The Plasterers won, but they had very
little in hand, and nothing to brag about.
As we remarked before, if Dave will per-
sist in wearing his old warrior down,
there’s nothing but disaster ahead for
him. Alecis playing great ball these days,
and it appears to us that he utterly ig-
nores anything but a home run. Herb
pitched for the Cubs; there is not a more
zealous playerin the league, and he plays

for all he is worth at all times. The Cubs

have some good players, amongst whom
we noticed one in particular, who made
some remarkable steals, and is coming to
the front by leaps and bounds.

We were sorry to see the way the
players jumped on the base umpire when
the poor fellow, through nervousness,
made a slight miscalculation; really, any
one would think from their attitude,
that they were paying these men big
fat salaries to stand on the field to be
ballyragged; it would be much more
generous and gentlemanly on their part,
if they would think of their own faults
instead of picking holes in others.

The final score was 6—3 in favor of
the Plasterers. '

Details of the game:—

Plasterers:—1st inning; Dave, passed,

stole second, and scored on Stump’s
home run.

Second inning, Alec singled, stole sec-
ond and third, and scored on the first
baseman’s error; Curley passed, stole
second and third, and scored on a wild
