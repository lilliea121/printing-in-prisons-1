Pointed Puns"You've made a mistake in your paper," said the indignant man, entering this office, the other day. "l was only a spectator last season _, and you said I was a scout."'Well, wasn't you," said Timmie. "N-O," replied Duckie, "and its confoundedly awkward, because, you see, I'm on a regular team, this season."Warden: "Did you find anything on the prisoner when you searched him?"Overseer: "Almost a wagon load of finely written paper."Warden: "Hold him till we find out if he is doing 'crooked work' or only a reporter on the UMPIRE.""What sort of a newspaper have you here," inquired the recently arrived stranger."Well," frankly admitted the Editor, "many of the brightest writers in here are regular contributors to the UMPIRE, without knowing it."
