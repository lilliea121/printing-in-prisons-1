SAID TO BE FUNNY

Iet us be thankful for .occasional visits from
the man who sees the funny side of things.

Modesty is a relative term of widely
consistent interpretation; as for instance:
—Freddie, aged 5, vainly hammers on
the bedroom door for admittance, ‘‘but
you mustn’t tum in Freddie,”” expostu-
lates Nellie aged 3, from within. ‘I
just dotup, an mamma says girls mustn’’
let little boys see ’em with their
nightie on, but’’—and only a moment
intervenes when, having solved the prob—
lem satisfactorily she adds, ‘“You can
tum in now, I’ve took it off.”’

MacKentieville now boasts a real
blonde ¢‘Public Stenographer and Type-
writer,””” who is up-to-the-minute and
some peach. Chews gum, smokes cigar-
ettes, and ‘‘don’t wear any rats in the

‘ hair, because there isn’t any hair to

wear,’’ but, the real thing just the same.

A Russian singer noticed o man’s legs
protruding from under his bed recently,
while taking an early morning shave.
Desiring to notify his wife, in an adjoin-
ing room, without alarming the burglar,
he calmly stropped his razor, and sang in
his native language:

““Fear not dear wife, but listen to me,

And do not lose your head,

Make a break for a cop, as soon as you can,
There’s a burglar under the bed.”

«‘But is this parrot a good bird? I
mean, 1 hope he doesn’t use dreadful
language,’”’ said the purchaser. Sile’s
a saint, lady,”’ replied the dealer. ‘‘He
sings hymns beautiful. I had some par-
rots wot used to swear something awful,
but, if you’ll believe me lady, that bird
converted the whole lot.”’

«“When I was catching for the New
York Giants in nineteen ten,’’ said Jin-
gles, ‘I had a narrow escape. A ball
just grazed my head.”’

«“Well, there’s no danger of that kind
now,’’ observed Andy, ‘‘for ther’s noth-
ing there to graze, that’s noticeable.”’

Hubby— (encouragingly to wife, who
is rocking the baby. ) “‘Remember, Ma-
ria, ’the hand that rocks the cradle, rul-
es the world’.”’

Wife—“Well suppose you come in
and rule the world a little while, I'm
tired.”’ |
