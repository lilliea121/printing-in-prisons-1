SPECIAL MEETING
Several other professional players are
on their way here, and due to arrive
within the present week. Naturally
there will be considerable competition
to secure their services, and in order that
no unfair advantage may be obtained
by any manager, a rule has been made,
prohibiting the signing of any player
until after he has left the receiving gal-
lery. A special meeting of the com-
mission will be held at once to confirm
this rule. The purpose of the President -
is to try and have these men signed up
by the weaker clubs to make the con-
tests more even and interesting.SPECIAL MEETING
