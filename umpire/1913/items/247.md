TRY SMILING

When the weather suits you not
Try smiling

When your coffee isn't hot,
Try smiling.

When your neighbors don’t do right

Or your relatives all fight,

Sure it’s hard but then you might
Try smiling.

Doesn’t change the things of course,
Just smiling;

But it cannot make them worse—
Just smiling

And it seems to help your case,

Brightens up a gloomy place;

Then it sort o’ rests your face—
Just smiling.
