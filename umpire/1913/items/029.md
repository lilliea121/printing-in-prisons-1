“BOB”

We all, have heard of ‘‘Square Deal Bob”’,
Who never rests, always on the job.

From morn till night he's in the place,
With a cheery smile upon his face.

The ‘‘boys”’ may come, and the ‘‘boys’’ may
gol
But ‘“‘Bob” is here, to run the show.
And you can bet, he knows the way,
To mix our work with a little play.

Now spring is here, and fun will start
The kind that touches each man’s heart.
The great American Game we’ll see.

Thanks to ‘Bob” J. Mc-Ken-ty.

It’s not for me, to sing his praise,
For we all kuow his kindly ways.

Poor life 'twould be, without our ‘‘Bob."’
W' Those are the thoughts of all our mob.

If when we’re sick, or feeling blue,
‘' Whom do we tell our troubles too?

A kind reply, a helping hand,

‘Ml Bob gives to all, of his convict band.

So when we’re gone, and far away,
Don’t let your minds to evil stray,

But think of ‘“‘Bob’’, whose words are wise,
‘' That victory comes, to he who tries.
