AMONG THE POETSTHE POWER OF WILLOut of the night that covers me, Black as the pit from pole to pole. I thank whatever gods may be For my unconquerable soul. In the fell clutch of circumstance I have not winced or cried aloud; Under the bludgeonings of chance, My head is bloody but unbowed. Beyond this place of wrath and tears Looms but the horrors of the shade; And yet the menace of the years Finds me, shall find me still unafraid. It matters not how straight the gate, How charged with punishment the scroll, I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul. William Ernest Henley
