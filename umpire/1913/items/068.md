BRINKERHOFE'S SELECTED
Vs

BAND & PLASTERERS UNITED

April g

On account of defective drain pipes,
the Ninth Block ground was in disorder,
and the game was ordered to be post-
poned,

Congequently, the members of the
above teams dispersed amongst the vari-
ous games, and when the Warden order-
ed the game to proceed, the men could
not be gotten together right away,

The First block were out to witness the
game, and rather than disappoint them,
our friend Mr, Brinkerhoff, jumped into
the breach, and selected nine of hig men
to challenge the remnants of the Band
and Plagterers combined, who had been
rounded up,

If we were not limited to gpace, we
would make some startling revelations,
respecting the latent talent inside these
walls, BSuflice it to say, that the Band
plus Plasterers met with a decigive de-
feat, chiefly through the untiring energy
which Mr, Brinkerhoff displayed, in urg-
ing his men on to victory,

As briefly ag possible, we give an ac-
count of the game as follows ;—

Many familiar faces were seen on the
grounds, including Louis, erstwhile
pitcher for the Cubs, who played a good
and cautious game; the well known Beef
Trust made a bold bid for victory, but
wias overhauled; Moge walled, stole sec-
ond and third and went home on Harry's
error; he algo caught two men very clever-
ly at short stop; the Cook and Climat
both got to third, but faded, Chick hit a
three bagger, but could not quite make
it.  Whitey singled, stole second and
third, and in a tremendous dash for
home, succeeded amid terrific applauge,
Skinny got a base on balls, and got
home on an error,

ed every minute, even if he did swat the
air, Chippy singled, stole sgecond and
third, and hit the dust with vengeance,
and gcored with a dash., And now we

sented wtih four wide ones, and stole

Josh’s gaff. Then on Whitey’s line
drive, he (Dad) like a flash of greased

the hearty congratulations which he

made of glass when he stole second, it
