Little Joe and his Orchestra are quite deserving of all the praise being bestowed upon them. Their work not only shows constant improvement, but the selections indicate a creditable appreciation of the tastes of the men, and are splendidly rendered. The entertainments they are now giving, go off with all of the vim usual to professionally trained musicians, Mr. Hammerstein will be after this "bunch" yet.
