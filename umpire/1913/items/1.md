SPIKING OF KNABE OF PHILLIES MAY CAUSE BLOOD POISONING

SOUTHERN PINES, N.C.
The first real hard luck of the Phillies’ training season hit the camp to-day, when Second Baseman Otto Knabe was severely spiked and put out of the game. He received a cut an inch long and about a quarter of an inch deep on his instep, and there is danger of blood poisoning setting in, as the heavy woolen stocking he wore was pressed into the wound. Trainer Mike Dee gave immediate atten-tion to the wound and Doc Miller took a couple of stitched in it. Knabe will not be able to play for several days, and if there is any signs of the wound being infected he will not attempt any more work here for fear of being out of the game when the regular championship season opens. The accident does not weaken the team any, as Dolan has been playing second base and has been doing the work, but Knabe is sure to missed, and there was an air of gloom permeating the atmosphere around the Phillies’ camp thiss evening. 

The score by innings:

Regulars 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 - 1
Yanigans 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 - 3
