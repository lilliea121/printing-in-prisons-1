GAMES OF AUGUST 8 Plasterers vs Ninth—Band vs Shed -- Library vs CubsBAND vs. STOCKING SHED The above teams clashed today, and in a full nine-inning game, decided the series in favor of the former. The game was played with much energy, and the victory was in the balance all the time. Rabbi and Yeap represented the teams in the box, and both pitched well. Very few free passes were issued and errors were scare. The Poet scored in 533 splendid style on Sweety's hit, opening the 2 ball for the Band in the fourth inning. Slim scored on Hank's two-bagger, assisted by a wild throw. Slick made two clear circles; Julius, sitting in judgment upon himself, ruled himself out at first, when as a matter of fact, he was as safe as the U.S. Treasury. In the ninth Yeap scored on the third baseman's fumble. The Shed made play with john, who scored on Joe's sacrifice in the second inning. Fred singled on mishap, and Julius got to third and faded. Joe scored on Spetz's double in the eighth. John Henry was in his usual merry vein, and kept the game alive. Result 6—2 in favor of Band.— Henry.
