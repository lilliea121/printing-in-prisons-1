 "IT ISN'T RIGHT" A number of men contributed toward a purse of money to be given to Timmie upon the eve of his departure, as an evidence of their kindly feeling toward him. When that young man heard of it, he firmly gave notice of his veto of the act, not because he failed to appreciate the generous impulse which inspired the movement, but as he explained the matter very tersely: "It wasn't right."
