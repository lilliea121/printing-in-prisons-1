STUART PITCHES NO HIT GAME
The Stocking Shedlets woke up today,
and ripped, tore, and banged the Cubs’
lineup for eight ‘‘yards.’”” Three Cub
pitchers essayed to stem the onslaught,
but it was useless. In the first two inn-
ings Miller, Cub pitcher, passed five. In
same innings, Jack and Big Slim, and
Ames each hit; Floyd hit, also, and
Ducky got a double. In fifth, Ames
doubled. Stuart had two hits. Stuart
pitched good ball, and was well support-
ed by back-stop and his field. Again
Jack played brilliantly at third; a catch
running backwards, equaled anything
ever seen inside the walls. KEight runs,
nine passes. Stuart passed four Cubs.
My books show that the Cubs did not
get a hit off of Stuart, (I may be mis-
taken.) One run for Cubs. A Texas
leaguer, that described a beautiful par-
abolic curve, dropped into Herb’s hands
and—dropped out again. Umpiring
faultless. During this game, the War-
den found occasion to stop a senseless,
heated argument between two players.
Don’t kill a good thing for nothing.
When this old earth grow whiskers,
there will be more fish in the sea.
