Jore is back in his old position with the Cubs. Little Freddie has sustained a wrenched ankle, which will keep him out of the game for some time. Swig, the Band's "professional," shows lack of acquaintance with bases. Twice in Tuesday's game with the Cubs, he made for the corner of the Storehouse steps, instead of the bag, and both times was caught. Takes one back to boyhood days, when the doorstep was first, a convenient tree, second, and a misplaced brick, third.
