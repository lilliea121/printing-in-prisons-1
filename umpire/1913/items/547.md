WITH THE POETS YOU FIRST. It doesn't cost a penny, No matter who you be, To wish a man ‘‘good morning," And thereby let him see, You know that he is living, And know he's human too; It's better, too, for you. It doesn't cost a penny, To always be polite, And if the world would heed it, There'd never be a fight, Just think how very happy Our lives would be and true, If everyone would whisper, "Alphonso, after you."-- Pliny
