INFORMATION

Dear David,

Greetings: â€™

Can it be that your twenty-

one inning pitcher is sick 2 We do not
wish to think so, and yet what else can
prevent you from putting him in the box.
We have not a thought that you are|
saving said pitcher for the series, and yet
we are sometimes haunted by a vague
fear that all is not right. Just one
game, dear David, and our little hearts
will be filled with sunshine.

Ever yours in sport,
Anxious.
