CUBS AND LIBRARY TIE July 2The combination of a heavy downpour of rain, acting in conjunction with John Henry, deprived the Library of what should have been a well earned victory Tommy and Freddie of the Cubs were opposed by Carter and Beef Trust of the Librarians. Both pitchers twirled only ordinary ball and had it not been for the splendid support accorded them, the game would have been decidedly more prolific in the matter of runs. In the first inning, Yeap scored the only run for the Librarians, stealing home by a bold dash, only made successful by its effrontery. For five innings the Cubs only succeeded in landing two men on third base, but, in the sixth, Freddie walloped out a home run, tying the game. A portion of the seventh inning was played, in which Tommy scored, by the grace of the umpire. A heavy rain came up in the meantime, and while play was continued until the Library had two men out and a man on second, the downpour refused to be ignored, and John Henry called the game, which reverted back to to the sixth inning, when the score was 1—1. — Mitch.
