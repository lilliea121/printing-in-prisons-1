THE WINTER STYLE Little girl, when on the street, You appear to be all feet, You wear your clothes so very tight— You are just an awful sight. Nothing on to keep you warm, Crazy just to show your form. Little girl, you won't live long, Just because you dress all wrong After while, I do believe, You will dress like Mother Eve. —B 6290.
