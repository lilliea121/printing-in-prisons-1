WHO'S WHO In MacKentieville. Who blows the horn and twangs the harp, and knows a flat from e z sharp? Who's got the bulge on the mandolin, the big bass drum and the violin? Who scouts the blocks for talent rare, to sing those songs that make us swear? Who trains a "‘ham"' into a first class ‘"‘mutt"' to withstand our jokes, and be our butt? Who sings, do ra mi, fa si do? Why dot Ostricher leeder, dot leedle Joe.
