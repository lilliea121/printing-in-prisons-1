PROCRASTINATION

Procrastination is the evil genius of
the human race. There is no earthly
excuse for it, but we are all more or less
addicted to it. It is the most unnecess-
ary of all human traits, and the most
common. It is no respecter of persons.
Intellectual giants and mental pigmies
are alike prone to procrastinate. It is the
deadly and unrelenting enemy of ambi-
tion and progress. It stultifies ability,
and lowers efficiency.

‘““Any time will do,”” and “‘I will at-
tend to it to-morrow,’”” ete. are sayings
that have damned many a person to

Once the habit of putting things
off is fully developed, a man has not one
chance in a thousand of ever catching up
