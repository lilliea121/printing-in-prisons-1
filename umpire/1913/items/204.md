Billy Sunday says: "That some people
are so stingy, that if you ask them to
sing 'Old Hundred;, they will sing
'Ninety and Nine' to save one cent."

A London man says his wife is so
thin he has to tie her in a knot before he
can kiss her Good Night!

When the parole men were being dis-
charged recently, Doc, Jack and Paddy,
of the Boiler House, were whistling a
song called; "You’ll Come Back." Can’t
imagine who they were alluding to.

Mark Twain said:— "Be good and you
will be lonesome." He evidently never
investigated the causes leading to the
Klondyke and and the loneliness there-
in.
