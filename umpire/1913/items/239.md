BAND vs NINTH

June 9

Monday’s game was hardly the kind
to fill the grand stands. It was very
spiritless until the last two innings and

although considerable scoring was then

rolled up it was hardly the result of
brilliant work.

The only run the Band tallied was in
the first inning when little Julius came
home; the team then went to sleep ex-
cepting the pitcher who did good work
until the last two innings when he be-
came wild. Failure to catch, and fumb-
ling the balls by the Band helped the
Ninth considerably. Jack’s run was
entirely due to the second baseman fum-
bling the ball on which he came home.

The very opposite occured in the last .

inning when a brilliant throw by Rube
It was the
prettiest play of the game. Yeap,
Smithie, Sam and Brownie are the others
that made runs for the Ninth bringing
the score up to 5-1. —Sam.BAND vs NINTH
