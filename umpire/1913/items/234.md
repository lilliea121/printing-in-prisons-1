NO MERCY FOR BAND

June 6

In the game between the Library and
Band to-day, Herman held the Book-
men down to two runs, until the fifth

inning, when he lost control, nerve, and
perhaps his shirt. For then it was that
all hands took a whack at the Band, and
never stopped until six runs were tallied.
It was heart-rending. Rich essayed to
finish the game, and another run was
made off of him.

The Band put in Eddie a new man,
who did well, and brought in one of the
the runs, in his stocking feet.

Wade formerly of the Ninth, made
his first appearance with Librarians and
put lots of ginger in his work.

Score 10-3. Umpire John Henry.
