STOCKING SHED vs CUBS 

May 8

The Stocking Shed turned the tables
on the Cubs today, in a well played
game. Although the Cubs lost, there
18 nothing about which to reproach them,
and like all other teams, they have their
off daysand this undoubtedly was one of
them, and it told the tale. Herb pitched
for the Cubs, and it was very apparent
that his arm was sore, because he was
in nothing like his usual form; but he
will come again, never fear. We observe
that Freddie, the catcher, isalways on
the job, and an ardent ball player from
start to finish.

The Stocking Shed was ably repre-
sented on the hill by its manager Stewart,
who did all that could be expected of him.

Also it is with pleasure that we record
the smart playing of our interesting and
untiring friend Duckey, who was much
in evidence to-day playing shortstop,
and to whom we desire to pay a glowing
tribute. Ie was severely on the alert,
and besides many exceptionally good
plays, he put the whole side out, in one
inning. No ball was to swift for him,
and his eagle eye was never more keen
than to-day. It is impossible in this,
orin any one issue of the UMPIRE to
compliment all the players who deserve
recognition equally as much as Duckey,
but we assure themn that nothing escapes
the notice of our ‘‘man on the spot,”’
and that they will come into their own
in due course. The result was 7—1
favor of the Stocking Shed.
