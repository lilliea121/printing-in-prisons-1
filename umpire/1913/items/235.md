PLASTERERS WIN AGAIN
June 9. FRET

The Plasterers today lined up Tony
and Stump, against Yellow and Beef
Trust for the Librarians and won out by
the score 3-2.

The whistle blew in the last half of
the seventh with Eggie, a famous run-—
ner on third, two men down, and Big
Six at the bat. As the latter had knock-
ed out a home run in the third, he would
have undoubtedly saved the game had
there been time, for only a single was
needed to tie it up, at least. Both Tony
and Yellow were going well, but there
was some very ragged fielding, and base
runningMike of the Librarians, who
has usually played good ball, making
errors of peculiar flagrancy to say the
least.

The Plasterers made their three runs
in the first inning, and only in two other
innings, did one of their men reach 3rd.
Tony struck out 9, Yellow 7. Big Six,
Tony and Aleck carried oftf the batting
honors. Umpires, John Henry and Neil.
