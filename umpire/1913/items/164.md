? ? ? 
You great big slob, you can't play ball, 
You yell and rant from spring to fall; 
No matter where or when or how
 You simply bellow like a cow; 
You stand on first just like a bag 
And think you're playing a game of tag. 
A can to you they ought to tie 
Then you'd have cause to yell and cry. 
Whenever you make a nice good play, 
You tell the boys, day after day 
I am the man that made that play. 
You bet they I never send me away. 
You're full of wind and full of cakes 
And all your noise are big mistakes. 
We never see you play a game 
Unless you yell and bust the same. 
But time will tell with all your noise, 
That ball ain't played with such a voice; 
Your yelling then will have an end 
And you'll be canned, there's where you'll land.
