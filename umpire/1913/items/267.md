SAME BAD STALLING June 5A very good game of baseball between the Library and Cubs was sadly marred in the last inning when the game stood 3-1 in favor of the Librarians, by some pretty rank stalling on the part of Jimmy's cohorts. The Cubs had three men on bases and none down, when the bell struck, and had the game been hustled along as it should have been, there would probably have been a different result. It is understood that the Cub's management will enter a protest. â€”Mitch.
