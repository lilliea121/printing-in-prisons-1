A MAN AND WORK

Work is action guided by poise and
wpurpose. Action accomplishes, per-
forms. Deity creates through man. No-
bility manifests itself in action; and
what the man is, is revealed in what he
does. The Master Man always and for-
ever is a workingman. Itis work that
has tempered and tamed him. And out
of the fulness of his strength he
guides, directs, counsels-—creates.

That-man is the greatest who best
serves his kind. Sympathy and know-
ledge are for use—you acquire, that you
may give out ; you accumalate, that you
may bestow. And as God has given
unto you the sublime blessings of sym-
pathy and wisdom, there will come to
you the wish to reveal your gratitude by
giving them out again; for the wise man
is aware that we retain only as we give.
Let your light shine. To him that bath,
shall be given. The exercise of wisdom
brings wisdom.
