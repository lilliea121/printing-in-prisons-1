AN OBSERVATION I've noticed in getting along on the track, In seeking life's laurels and premiums high, A man can do more with a slap on the back Than ever he does with a punch on the eye. It makes little matter the style of the cribs ‘You set out to crack in the face of your foes, More prizes will come from a dig in the ribs Than ever were won by a whack on the nose. In public, in private, whatever your field, — Wherever you labor, in hamlets or towns, A far richer profit, life's harvests will yield To mortals whose smilings, outnumber their frowns. —J. K. Bangs
