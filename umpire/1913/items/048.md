LIBRARY vs NINTH,

In a well played practice game on F'ri-
day, the Ninth defeated the Library by
the score of 2-1. ‘The game was interest-
ing from start to finish, and some bright
and snappy plays were pulled off. From
the way the Library played against the
Ninth, they are going to bea contender
for the flag, and it will be well for the

' tle when they meet them.

'in the third inning, and marred what
would have been a perfect day for the
' Library’s manager. A bat that he had
intended to use all season, and which
- was made especially for him by a firm in
Kokomo, Ind., wasbroken. Ittouched
‘us to the heart to see the look on the
Library manager’s face. But he was
brave; ah yes, far more than some of
his players. ‘‘Big Whitey’’ was so over-
come with emotion, that he had to be
'assisted to the Store House steps; and
'even then he couldn’t control his feelings,
untill Mr. Loan took him in and let him
look at abag of sugar. Poor ‘‘Beef Trust’’
was seen leaning against the wall crying,
as tho his poor little heart would break.
Upon questioning him as to why he took
it hard, we discovered that the bat really
belonged to. him—his brother having got
is with a $4.85 suit at Gimbel’s.

One of the features of the game, was
the coaching of ‘‘Joe’’, clerk in the
| Writers’” Room.
