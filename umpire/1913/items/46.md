Can You Solve It?The following puzzle in figures has been given out during the week. It's about two crowds of ten men who walked into a cafe, each buying a round of five cent drinks, as per the sample. The example is six men buying a round each at the single cost of thirty cents per round, or $1.80 in all, while four purchase for themselves at cost per round of twenty cents, or eighty cents in all, making a total of $2.60. The other ten divided equally, five buying five rounds at twenty five each, or $1.25 in all, making the gross on their double purchases $2.50. It works out in figures like this.
| 6 | x | 5 | -- | 30 | x | 6 |   | $1.80 |       |
| 4 | x | 5 | -- | 20 | x | 4 |   | $.80  |       |
|   |   |   |    |    |   |   |   | ——    | $2.60 |
| 5 | x | 5 | -- | 25 | x | 5 |   | $1.25 |       |
| 5 | x | 5 | -- | 25 | x | 5 |   | $1.25 |       |
|   |   |   |    |    |   |   |   | ——    | $2.50 |
The mathematicians want to know why two sets of ten men by buying ten rounds of drinks for each party at a uniform price of five cents per drink should show a difference of ten cents in the totals.
