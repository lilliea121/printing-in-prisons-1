WORK AND WAIT A faith more deep and changeless In the fatherhood of God; A hope more high and rangeless For the ways that men yet must trod; A little more abiding By the counsel of the heart ; A little less of chiding When you have to bear your part Of life's trials and disappointments— Nearly always you will find That the peace of joy's anointments Follow very close behind,— A child, to keep you mindful Of the nearness of His love; A friend to keep you mindful, And a home where, far above All the toil and tears of trying, You can reach the open gate, That leads out of strife and sighing, When you've learned to watch and wait. — Selected.
