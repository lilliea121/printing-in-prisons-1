THE ORCHESTRA.

IRST comes Joe our leader,.
With his fiddle sweet and true,
And by him sits our old friend Jack :
He plays first fiddle, too.

Then come Steve and Billy,
My, how those clarinets scream !

With cadenzas, variations,
They’ll put you in a dream:.

Dave, plays solo cornet,
Roge could too, (if he tried),

And Bell, you know, makes quite a show,
With his slippery trombone slide.

The baritone, is not a drone,
Dear Goldie plays quite neat,

Bass runs, like guns, come rushing
Exactly on the beat.

Larry, plays nifty on the "cello,
Sweet solos, sombre, deep,

With the Wop and Jingles, Jonesy, Bob,
Second fiddles, violas, a heap.

The big bass fiddle, Jimmie plays,
To keep us all in time,
In truth to tell, with Ralph and Dell,
The Drums are bouud to rhyme.
Henry, at the piano,
Strike ‘‘A,”’ we’ll get in tune,
Let the Poet sing a solo,
““Our Quartette,”” an oldtime tune,

—Tingles.
