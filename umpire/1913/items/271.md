A FRIENDLY SORT O’ WAY

When a man ain’t got a cent, an’ he’s feelin’
kind of blue,

An’ the clouds hang dark and heavy,
woun t let the sunshine through.

It’s a grand thing my brethern, for a fellow
just to lay

His hand upon your shoulder in a friendly
sort o’ way.

It makes a man feel curious: It makes the tear-
drops start,

An' yousort o’ feel a flutter in the region o’
your heart.

You can 't look up and meet his eyes :
don t know what tosay

When his hand is on vour sheulder in a
friendly sort 0" way

Oh the world’s acurious compound with its
honey and its gall,

With its cares and bitter crosses; but a good
world after all.

An’ a good God must have made it—leastways
that’s what I say .

Whena hand rests on yourshoulderina
friendly sort o way.

an’

You
