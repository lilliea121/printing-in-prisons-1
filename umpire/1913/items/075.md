A FEW LOCAL SQUIBS

If knowledge is power, Overseer Joe

'Smith and John Myers, are powerful.

Their knowledge of baseball, and their
discussions on the fine points of the
game, are both interesting and enter-

' taining.

April showers bring May flowers, but

'they also bring gloomy expressions to

most of the baseball enthusiasts around
these parts.

The new Quartette made their initial
bow, on the Sixth Block last Saturday
evening, and they sure did make good,
and then some.

The Rabbi refused an offer to umpire
in the Southern League, when his con-
tract runs out here. He seems to be
afraid of the lynch law, in some of the
Southern' States.

The Plasterers played ¢‘That Mysteri-
ous Band’’ on Thursday, and the Band -
played “‘I’m Afraid to go home in the
dark.”’ The day before the Ninth
made the Cubs, ‘“Go way back and sit
down,’”” While the Library showed the
““A hot time in the old
town to-night.”’
