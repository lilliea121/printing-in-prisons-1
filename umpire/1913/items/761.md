WITH THE POETS THE BRIDGE OF YESTERDAY Over the bridge of yesterday, My thoughts have turned to-night, And out of the far off distance, Comes a tender, glowing light. It centers around a friendship, That has lasted through time and tide. Though the chance and change of fortune, Has severed our pathways wide. It may be that Earth's to-morrow, Hold for us no meeting place. It may be that only in Heaven, I shall meet you face to face. But when mem'ry seeks a pleasant trip, And the choice of a pathway comes; I choose the bridge of yesterday, -To the days when we were chums. â€”B 5679 & B 6732
