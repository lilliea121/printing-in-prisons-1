The UMPIRE is in need of interesting |

material for its columns. Every man in
the place has at least one good story
concealed about his person. Let us
have that story. Put it in good plain
English, just as you would talk, and it
will be readable and interesting. Don’t
try to put it in verss. We are over-
whelmed with poetry. It would seem
that all of the poets in the state are in
this place, and many people agree that
it is the one good place for all good poets.

Epigrams, of the right sort, arein
large demand.

Humor, original and within the proper
“family lines’’ is also in demand.

Essays on the results obtained, by the
use of nitro-glycerine in conjunction with
iron or steel are not of special value, nor
are subjects dealing with the newest
methods of avoiding a ‘‘cop’’ of interest-
at present.

Let your story be human. Be concise,
but, don’t neglect descriptive details.
If there are any rough edges in the gram-
mar or composition, we will have the
carpenter plane them down. Send them
in.
