LIBRARY BEAT BAND Win Tie Game in Exciting Contest by Score 5—1. The Library and Band met yesterday afternoon on the Store house grounds to determine the winner of the tie game played the day before. Yeap and Ike, Dave and Balty represented the Bandmen in the battery, while Ban and Beef Trust worked the heavy artillery for the Librarians. Ban started the ball rolling by stealing home in the first. In the third he was struck by a wild ball and scored on Slip's double. In this inning little Ike came home on a passed ball, scoring the only run obtained by the Band. In the fourth, there was Hail Columbia, due to the umpires' unfamiliarity with the rules. Stew passed, reached second and third, and was caught at the plate. Charlie and Bob each walked, the former scoring on Tommy's hit. The latter was then on second, and Bob on third when Josh came up, hit the ball, made first, passed second, where Tommy was, and caught out. Bob in the meantime came home. The Band claimed that Josh and Tommy were both out, which was correct, according to the rules, but, Walt, the base umpire, decided not. Tommy got in on Ban's single, which concluded the game, as the Band could do nothing in their half. Umpires, John Henry, Walt. —Mitch.
