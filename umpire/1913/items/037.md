SQUIBS

Wednesday, April 2, 1913.

April showers.

The Orchestra gave a concert on the
Twelfth Block Saturday evening.

FOR SALE—One Goat. Inquire to
J. Dick, Tower, mornings only.

Overseer Dutton wears a broad smile
these days. Some say he has already
ordered the flag.

The boys in the Wash House will be
glad to learn that Overseer Tucker is on
the road to recovery after a long illness.

““Whitey’’ doesn’t believe in advertis-
ing, having received no reply as yet
from his ad. in last week’s UMPIRE.

Lefty o’ the Ninth Block Team, has
been nursing a strained thumb. Hello,
Lefty, hope you’ll be in good shape when
the seascn opens.

Mr. Jordan, our esteemed Postmaster,
has written to President Wilson, com-
mending him for his stand against the
Trusts. He says they are carrying things
too far—he can’t get trust anywhere
now days.

Question.—Does the UMPIRE pay any-
one for contributions ?>—J.

Answer.—No, Jingles; but when any
thing contributed especially pleases the
Editor, he may send you an extra copy
of the UMPIRE.

Managers of the various teams are in-
structed that in all league games, ten
minutes before play ball is called by the
umpire, they must furnish to the official
scorer, the number, fielding position, and
batting position of each player, other-
wise their records will not figure in the
official averages of the league. Ifa man-
ager so desires, he can have a score keep-
er of his own, but in the event of any
- disagreement or confusion, as to the
number of runs scored, the official scor-
er’s tally shall be final. Umpires are
advised in case of doubt, as to the num-
ber of balls or strikes called, to refer
to the official scorer and accept his tally.LOCAL
