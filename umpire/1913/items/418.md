PLASTERERS vs LIBRARY The Plasterers brought their game with the Librarians to a conclusion today, with a shutout. Their old south paw did not deviate one whit from his usual form, and he was ably opposed by 3 Mike who pitched a splendid game, and finished up with 11 strikeouts to his credit. The fielding on the whole was excellent, and many fine catches were executed by the outfielders. Ban caught several and he surpassed himself at first base. Yellets made a home run swat and scored Yaller in the third inning, which commenced the aggregation. He also scored another run later, as did Harry, Tony, Yaller and Stump. Felix made a clean cut to right field and negotiated three bases; Stump hit a double, and Yellets made a smart double play. The Library slammed the ball about considerably, but they could not complete the necessary distance and score. Tommy walked and was caught stealing third; Ban cracked a single to center and faded at third; Timmy got to third and was doubled.—Score 6—0 — Henry.
