PLASTERERS.

The Plasterers won another from the
Library this afternoon in a manner so
decisive as to leave no room for doubt.

The old ‘“Warrior,”” as we hoped, was
again at his favorite post, and pitched
gilt edge ball. It seemed as though he
was determined to demonstrate, for the
last time, to his departing manager Dave
that he need not leave us in fear and
trembling on their account, for the fame
of the team was in no danger, but on
the contrary was in good hands, and
could be trusted to maintain its prestige
and glory of the past so dearly bought.

There was a frightful fusilade all the
time, and fast and furious singles and
doubles were dispatched to the four car-
dinal points; so much so, that at times
we could well imagine we were witness-
ing a Marathon race; runs being scored
in such quick succession.

At 4:55 when 8 innings had been played,
the stock of balls became exhausted,
otherwise a full game of 9innings would
have been recorded.

- The following men scored: Felix home
run; Barber (3), Tony (2), Stump (3).
Alex and Harry. Tony, Alex and Felix
also hit two-baggers, and many other
good plays were executed Curley ef-
fected a fine catch, straight off the Dbat
at terrific velocity, which retired the
side in that inning.

The Library were entirely outplayed
but withal, played a very plucky game.
Yaller was on the hill butit seemed to
us, hopeless from the beginning. We
- are sorry there is not much to record
about the Library's play. who but for
Ban’s most opportune home-run, would
 have been left with a round O.

Jimmie twice got to 3rd but was oust-
ed forthwith, on each occasion. Joe,
Dud and Beef Trust each essayed to
score, but their hopes were frustrated.

‘A word before closing should be said
‘for their outfielder, Big Six, whose
chances to exploit himself were greatly
minimized, and impeded by the line of
