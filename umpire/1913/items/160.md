As the base ball season is now well ad-
vanced, and everything seems to be going
smoothly, we think it is time to step out,
and let those who are actively engaged
in playing the game, manage the affairs
of the League a3 they deem best. We
have found, like a great many before
have done, that you can not serve two
masters; one, if not both of them are
bound to suffer. So from now on, the
UMPIRE can not be charged with be-
ing affiliated with any one team, and we
will try to do justice to all. We will
not be responsible for any of the rules or
actions of the players while playing, or
in any way connected with the manage-
ment of the League, only so far as the
encouraging of good, and the condemning
of the bad, and that only from our point
of view. We will try to be fair to all
and partial to none, and the spot-light
of publicity will be thrown on every one,
from the president down to the sub-play-
er, We believe it advisable at this time
to have you bear in mind, that the War-
den and the officers are all readers of
the UMPIRE, and tho’ Tom, Bill and Dick
may only be mentioned, there are very
few, if any, that the Warden iS not
aware who the party is we mention.
Those who are looking forward to being
released at some future date, should
bear in mind that their conduct on the
ball field, will be considered the same as
in the shop or cell; and in conclusion,
to quote Rocky, ‘‘Beware of the dog”’

When Chee Chaw is released on parole
next week, at his request the band will
play, I Don’t Care If You Never Come
Back.”’

Next week’s series between the Ninth
and Plasterers, will decide the first half
of the season.

A certain party said, ‘“Give the under

dog a chance.”” Well, I’ve been bark-
ing incessantly.

Slick would create a sensation in Cuba.As the base ball season is now well ad-
