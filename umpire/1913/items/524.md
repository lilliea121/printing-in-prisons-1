EPIGRAMS The manner of saying or doing anything goes a great way toward the value of the thing itself. Cheerfulness throws sunlight on all the paths of life. Accept your lot as a man does a piece of rugged ground, and begin to get out the rocks and roots, to deepen and mellow the soil, to enrich and plant it. There would not be so many open mouths, if there were not so many open ears. Small kindnesses, small courtesies, small considerations, habitually practiced in our social intercourse, give a greater charm to the character than the display of great accomplishments. Behavior is a mirror in which everyone shows his image.
