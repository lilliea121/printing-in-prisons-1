PLASTERERS vs STOCKING SHED

May 19

The Bear-Cats Bryanized the Shed 16--
1. Money kings and old time republi-
cans quaked.

Two southpaws toed the scratch, and
only one finished. Curly pitched mas-
terly ball after the first inning. He
was wild only in that inning, and the
Shed . took advantage and scored their
only tally.

Curley had everything that bore re-
semblance to elusiveness. â€˜I'hat, and
terrific hitting by his consistent team-
mates, rolled up a big score. The students
proved quite friendly by beating the
Ninth, and putting Plasterersin lead for
pennant. Stump uncorked a home-run
and a hit. Curley doubled twice. With
two on bases, Felix cleared with a triple.
Harry duplicated the performance later
on. Felix also doubled. Harry, Tony,
Fatty, Alex and Jim singled.

Floyd, the other southpaw, was bat-
ted out of the box in the foursh; his
straight ball was very easy to solve.

Ducky stepped in and, even being
wild, stopped the Bear-Cat's clouting.
The game was interspersed with ragged
fielding and the opposite.

When a fielder makes an error on an
easy chance, the batter is not entitled
to a hit. KEddie, umpire, knows his
business. Rocky.
