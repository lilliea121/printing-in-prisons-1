SPIDER ANSWERS THE GANG

Have you ever heard of the ‘“Sky light man?”’
Of course you have, he's a base ball fan.
About base ball not a thing he knows,
Yet he yells and roots and wiggles his toes.
At the start of the season you’d hear him say
“The Ninth wi/l win—are here 7o stay.”’
But the rest of the gang kept pushing him,
Saying, ‘‘just wait, a new:song you'll sing;’’
Well, here is where that song will begin,
And I hope in your ears forever will ring,
I might be a mut on the base ball game
Not looking for laurels, or any fame.
When it comes to stalling or a game to fram
I’m only a dub, and very tame, i
But here is 72y answer to all the gang: ‘
Your judgment was bum from beginning to end
A game of marbles, you might play that—
But a game of ball, you don’t know, that’s a
faect: ,
Don’t come around with your hard luck cry
You «imply lost out; in the fight you did die.
A gang of /fas beens, you struck a snag
From this time on, you better play tag.
