SHED OUTCLASSED June 27 The Stocking Shed was helpless in the hands of the Plasterers today, despite Duckey's heroic work in the box, and went down and out to the tune of 8-2. Curly pitched four innings for the Plasterers and was ordered out of the game in the fifth by Happy, for insulting Lippy the base umpire. Yaller then went in to finish the game, which he did in a hurry.
