Ninth Block Wins First

Half of the Season
Nose Out Plasterers By One Game

When the Library defeated the Plas-
terers last Saturday, by the score of 6 to
2, the Ninth Block stepped into first
place as the undisputed Champions of
the first half of the 1913 season.

From the time the umpire called ‘“‘play
ball’” on April 7th, right up to the last
day of the 30 game season, the Plas-
terers and Ninth were neck and mneck;
and not until Saturday the 14th, when
the tie game of June 11th, between the
Plasterers and Library was played, and
the Plasterers defeated, was the race de-
cided. Before the game, every one, in-
cluding the members of the Ninth,
thought that a tie between the Plasterers
and the Ninth wasinevitable. The wise
ones, who play form, were dissappointed,
as the Library played all around the Plas-
terers; the latter putting up by far the
worst exhibition of ball they have shown
this season.

Towards the close of the first half, the
Plasterers played in hard luck; losing

to defeat the Plasterers. On June 2nd
they opened a three game series with the
Cubs, when the biggest surprise of the
season was sprung on the hase ball fol-

two out of three from the Plasterers;
thereby spiking their chances for the
pennant. The third club in the race was
this self-same Cub team. Their mana-
ger by hard and consistent work building
them up from an ‘‘also ran’’ club, to
one that must be considered in the last
half of the season. The Library, which
is tied for third place with the Cubs was
a disappointment. With material enough
to make one of the best teams in the
league, the best they could do, was to
tie for the third place. Poor manage-
ment the first of the season with dissen-
sion among its players, was mainly the
cause of its downfall. The Stocking
Shed brought up fifth, and though han-
dicapped by lack of pitching material,
made it interesting for the team ahead
of them. The Band plays good music
but poor baseball. They don’t seem to
try and strengthen their team at all.

By this time next week the
second half of the season will be on
its way, and a better article of ball is
looked for from all the teams.
