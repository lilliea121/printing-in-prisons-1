CUBS 3 BAND 0

July 1
To-day, for the third time, the Band
and Cubs met to decide the winner of

the twice-tied game of June 23. Ow-
ing to a delay in starting, only two full
innings were played, the Cubs, being
the victors, score 3-0.

Ban, for the Musicians, was very wild
and only good fielding on the part of his
associates prevented the Cubs from ad-
ding to the agony.

Herb, on the contrary, working in the
box for the Cubs, was very steady, and
struck out four of the six men, who came
up before him.

The real feature of the event, was a
brilliant cateh of a vicious drive by Tim-
my, who was seated in the grand stand,
acting as an official body-guard to three
young lady visitors. When the Poet’s
dollar-and-a-quarter ball came hurling
toward them with the velocity of a shell
from a 6 inch rapid-fire gun, Timmy,
as became a true and valorous knight, in-
terposed the whole of his 120 1bs. be-
tween the ladies and the coming danger,
deftly caught the messenger of death at
the critical moment, and hurled it back
with disdainful sang froid, while the
crowd applauded his heroism, and want-
ed him to do it over again. There was
no response to the encore. — Mitch.CUBS 3 BAND 0
