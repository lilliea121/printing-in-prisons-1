PLASTERERS vs BAND

Band Would Have Beat Plasterers,
If Weather Hadn’t Been Stormy

That which had every appearance of
being a very fine game, was commenced
today between the above teams, and
brought to a premature finishby an
angry thunder storm, which at the same
time, for many reasons was most welcome.

Both teams were in real earnest, and
bent on gaining the victory, but the
Plasterers won by the slender margin of
one run.

The Bandsmen were playing with much
vigor, and but for the elements, most
probably would have been returned the
winners.

Alec, Felix, and Frank, each scored a
run, and we especially noticed the very
smart playing of the latter, both in the
field and at the bat.

Hitherto all of our prognostications
have materialized, and in this case,
before the season is finished, this young
trojan, in company with some others, will
be found in the van.

Harry was on the bench today ; for
what reason we are not informed, but
nevertheless we do not commend Dave,
for changing his line up at such a criti-
cal moment. Six and the Poet scored
for the Band, and the whole team seems
now to be playing like one man.

As the rain came down, the game was
being most fiercely contested, butit had
speedily to be abandoned. Result 3—2
in favor of the Plasterers.
