WHO'S WHO In MacKentieville Who pounds the dough to make the bread, upon which we are so plentifully fed? Who guards our health to such an extent, that never a hot loaf to us is sent, to give us cramps, and disturb our sleep, "when shades of darkness over us creep?" Who uses his skill in an effort â€˜to make, the large and toothsome ginger cake? Who pitches a ball like a hunk of dough? Why that bakeshop gent, that Tony you know.
