STOCKING SHED vs BAND
July 2

The Stocking Shed is a much stronger
team than when we last saw them out,
and to-day they toyed with the Band in
such admirable style, that at the finish
they had registered another shut-out to
their credit. Their new twirler ‘“The
Rabbi”’ officiated in a most creditable
manner, and put them over squarely in
the groove. Their batting was excellent,
and in the field they were as nimble as
cats on hot bricks. Big Six was in fine
form, and as well as scoring, doubling
and érebling with terrific clouts and
bringing in several runs, he made two
bold bids for victory, but was thrown out
at the plate. 'The seven runs were sub-
scribed by Jimmy (2,) Fingers (2,)
John, Big Six, and the reliable Midget
Spetz.

Louie pitched for the Band but it was
evidently not his day to shine. He is-
sued several free passes, which in some
cases led up to runs.

Josh by extremely quick fielding,
caught Big Six within a foot of the dise.
Baltimore trebled and faded and but for
that play, the Shed allowed them noth-
ing resembling a run.

Rain came and caused a hurried re-

treat leaving the game stand 7-0 favor
of Stocking Shed.
