“JUST TRY TO BE THE FELLOW THAT
YOUR MOTHER THINKS YOU ARE”

Whilst walking down a crowded city street
the other day, ‘

I heard a little urchin to a comrade turn and
say—

¥‘Say, Chimmey, lemme tell youse, I'd be
happy as a clam

If T only was the fellow dat me mudder tinks
I am,

She tinks I am a wonder, an’ she knows her
little lad

Could never mix wit’ nutting dat was ugly
mean or bad.

Oh lots o’ times I set and tink, how nice
‘twould be, gee whiz !

If a feller was de feller that his mudder tinks
heis.”

My friends, be yours a life of toil, or undil-
uted joy,

You still can learn a lesson from this small
unlettered boy.

Don't try to be an earthly saint with eyes fix-
ed on the stars,

Just try to be the fellow that your mother
thinks you are. — Wil S. Adkin.
