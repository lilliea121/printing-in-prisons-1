LIBRARY vs NINTH

April 24

The Ninth defeated the Library in the
final game of the series, thereby making
a clean sweep. Andy, who can play any
position ou a ball team, took up the pitch-
ing end in today’s game for a change, and
done exceedingly well. He was opposed
by Bill, of the Ninth, who held the Li-
brarians helpless. The Library only could
put one man across the plate. Jimmy
walked, stole second and third, and on
Slick’s throw to third, to catch him nap-
ping, he scored; Slick’s throw being wild.
The only clean hit by the Library, wasa
two bagger, by Ollie to left.

Lefty, first up for the Ninth, started
trouble for Andy by hitting the second
ball pitched for the circuit. Cap. hit
safe and stole third, and while Walter
was getting his breath, Cap. stole
home. In the second, Timmy walked,
and after several attempts by Andy to
catch him off second, threw wild and he
landed on third, from which he scored on
Yeap’s long fly to Eggie. One of the
most interesting features of the afternoon
was the performance of Slick, who un-
loaded 250 bushel of potatoes in eight
minutes and twenty-two seconds on a bet.
Of course, the game was delayed until
the potatoes were unloaded, so Jim, the
runner on the first block, came to Slick’s
assistance by taking four petatoes and
pufting them in his pocket. —Timmy

NINTH vs PLASTERERS
April 23
The Ninth met the Plasterers for the
second time this year, and the result was
-reversed; the Ninth bringing home the
bacon by the score of 7—1. Longie start-
ed the game, and was going fine, but
was releived by Bill in the fourth, who
held the Plasterers scoreless. Curly, as
usual, was on the firing line for the
‘““Mud Slingers,’”’ but was not very effect-
ive. Rube is still stinging the ball, hav-
ing a home run and a two bagger. This
makes four home runs in three games
—Mr. Baker, take notice.

The umpires should stop Dave from
stepping in front of the ball. 'We do not
mind him getting his base so much, but
we are afraid he will be out of the game
through injuries, and that would be far
worse a blow to the Plasterers, than the
blow he received on his arm. After the
Plasterers went out in order in their first

half, the Ninth got to Curly from the
start. Lefty waited for four wide ones,
and Rube followed with a home run over
the roof. Stump dropped Cap’s fly, but
Cap, was doubled up, when Slick, by
poor head work hit at the first ball over.
Fatty making a nice catch, doubling
up Cap. at first. Longie is suprising
everyone by his hitting this year. He
came through with a home run this
game. The Plasterers were very weak
with the stick, not getting a ball beyond
second base. Dave played his usual
good game, likewise Curly, who fielded
his position good, taking everything
that came his way. Dave’s ¢ WHITE
HOPE" was seen warming up around by
the burner, but for some reason, best
known to himself, must have been
very chilly, as he was still there when
the whistle blew. —TimmyLIBRARY vs NINTH
