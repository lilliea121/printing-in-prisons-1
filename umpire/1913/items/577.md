ARMY AND NAVY CAN'T AGREE Football enthusiasts have received a shock in the authoritative statement that the annual late November game, between the Army and Navy will not be held this year owing to the insistence of the Naval Cadets upon Franklin Field as the place of struggle. The Army men claim that they are unable to secure a sufficient number of tickets from the University of Pennsylvania management, to meet the demands of their friends, and suggested the Polo grounds in New York, or the Army's own grounds at West Point, instead. The Naval boys refused these suggestions, so the Army quietly arranged with the Carlisle Indians for a post-Thanksgiving Day game on November 29. It is thought that the secretaries of War and Navy, will take a hand in the matter, and insist upon the boys coming together and agree on some arrangement, at least satisfactory, to the public.
