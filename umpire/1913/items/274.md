NO MERCY FOR BAND June 6 In the game between the Library and Band today, Herman held the Book-men down to two runs, until the fifth inning, when he lost control, nerve, and perhaps his shirt. For then it was that all hands took a whack at the Band, and never stopped until six runs were tallied. It was heart-rending. Rich essayed to finish the game, and another run was made off of him. The Band put in Eddie a new man, who did well, and brought in one of the the runs, in his stocking feet. Wade formerly of the Ninth, made his first appearance with Librarians and put lots of ginger in his work. Score 10-8. Umpire John Henry.  â€” Mitch.
