NINTH vs PLASTERERS

June 30 .

There was a great game of ball be-
tween the Ninth and Plasterers this af-
ternoon, which was won by the former
in the last half of the last inning, when
Yaller, the Plasterers speedy hurler,
weakened, and four runs tallied against
him. Up to this time he pitched won-
derfully good ball, striking out nine, of
the seventeen men who faced him, and
allowing only one hit, but, that one for
a home run by Eggie.

At the beginning of the sixth inning,
the score stood 1-1 with Plasterers up.
Stump hit Bill for a clean homer and
then pandemonium reigned among the

Plasterers’ rooters. Tony struck out,
Felix hit, stole around to third and
Andy knocked a beauty over the wall
and—out. _ -

In their half, the Ninth led with Bill,
who singled, and then Chef found the
ball for a clout around the bases, chas-
ing Bill in all the way. Rube singled,
stole second, coming home on Lefty’s
two-bagger, who in turn was sent in by
some one’s two-base hit. Net result four
runs. Score 5-2. 'The game was re-
markably free from errors and marked
throughout by snappy playing. Yaller
distinguished himself in the box, in the
field and at the bat, bringing in one of
the two runs of the Plasterers. Umpire
Mack. — Mitch.
