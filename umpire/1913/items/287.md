GRATITUDE

Of the many things that we can give,
To all things animate that breathe and live,
There’s one, which in all should be imbued,
The tendency to show our gratitude.

If on the street you meet a friend,
To whom you would a fiver lend,
Just think a moment, would he pay,
That fiver back some future day.

Now while in here, there's many a lad,
That wants things from you, and wants
them bad,
It’ well and good, if you say yes,
But just say no, you’re in a mess.

-| But still should you, with open hands,

Give all that this chap demands,
There are but few, who would come back,—
Of gratitude, there is a lack.

To give to those who need, is fine,
But take this tip, and draw the line,
When someone, with a real glib tongue,
Gives that story, long since sung.

For they are far and few between,
That are really, what they seem,

Don’t judge them by the clothes they wear—
If they shine their shoes, or comb their hair.

But when some fellow, means alright,
Who does not shout, or want to fight,

| Just dig down in vour jeans’ and sa
te} J )

‘‘Here pal, just take your time to pay.”’

And on that fellow you can bet,
You need not worry him, or fret,
He’ll not be troublesome or rude,
But he will show his gratitude.
