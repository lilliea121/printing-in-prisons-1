Just Try To Be The Fellow That Your Mother Thinks You AreWhilst walking down a crowded city streetthe other day,I heard a little urchin to a comrade turn andsay-"Say, Chimmey, lemme tell youse, I'd behappy as a clamIf I only was the fellow dat me mudder tinksI am,She tinks I am a wonder, an' she knows herlittle ladCould never mix wit' nutting dat was uglymean or bad.Oh lots o' times I set and tink, how nice'twould be, gee whiz!If a feller was de feller that his mudder tinkshe is."My friends, be yours a life of toil, or undiluted joy,You still can learn a lesson from this smallunlettered boy.Don't try to be an earthly saint with eyes fixed on the stars,Just try to be the fellow that your motherthinks yon are. -Will S. Adkin.
