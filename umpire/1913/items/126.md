LIBRARY BEAT BAND

Barely Win Out, as the Band Team
is Strengthened Considerably

One of the most interesting and
finely played games of the season, was
pulled off at the Store House grounds
Friday afternoon. From the time the
umpire cried, ‘‘play ball,”’ until seven
minutes of five, there was always some-
thing doing. Yellow was the slab artist for
the Library, and was steady with men
on bases. Larry, the Band pitcher,
deserved a better fate, but some of his
misfortune he brought on himself.

Until the eighth inning was reached,
the score was two to two; and the two
runs secured by the Library was a gift
from Larry. In the first inning with
two down, he had plenty of time to get
the batter at first, but threw hard and
wild, and the first run crossed over.

In the third inning, with one down and
a man on second, Larry thinking there
were two out, told Big S8ix to get the
man at first, instead of getting the man
going home, which caused another run,
which goes to show that a player should
have his mind on the game.

In the fourth, Josh walked, and Big
Six hit safe. On Ban’s error of Nelse’s
easy grounder, two runs crossed the
plate, tying the score. Both teams then
settled down and played fast ball until
the last half of the eighth, ILew drove
a liner to left, and Yellow hit the roof
for three bases, but the umpire only
allowed him two. Big Whitey smashed
one over the roof for a home run, and
Ban made up for his error hitting to the
same place for another. The little fel-
low who plays third for the Band, is
some fielder. He is not only a good
fielder, but he knows what to do with
the ball when he gets it. Josh, excelled
at short, and made some very clever stops.

Lew also gathered in two difficult flies
out in left field. Space will not allow
us to go any further, but we will close
by saying, both teams played good ball.
