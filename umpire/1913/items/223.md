CUBS vs BAND Friday May 23 The Cubs handed the Bandits a dose of usual foregone ‘‘conclusion'' 5-0. Sweeney pitched for the losers and held opposing batters hitless for a short time; then the slug brigade opened a wide gap. Larry caught well. Herb and Freddy worked like a machine. Herb pitched championship ball. We are hoping that the bandits will win another game so we can dole out the meed of praise that will mark an epoch in ballistic slang writing. —Rocky.
