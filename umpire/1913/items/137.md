D

You great big slob, you can’t play ball,
You yell and roatr from spring to fall;

No matter where or when or how

You simply bellow like a cow;

You stand on first just like a bag

And think you’re playing a game of tag..
A can to you they ought to tie

Then you’d have cause to yell and cry.
Whenever vou make a nice good play,
You tell the boys, day after day

I am the man that made that play.

You bet they'll never send me away.
You're full of wind and full of cakes
And all your noise are big - mistakes.

We never see you play a game

Unless you yell and bust the same.

But time will tell with all your noise,
That ball ain't played with such a voice;
Your yelling then will have an end

And yow’ll be canued, there's where you'l1l

land, —Spider
