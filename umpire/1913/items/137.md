S. SHED OUTCLASSED Cubs Outplay Stocking Shed Every Minute of the Game A herd of nine wild Cubs were set loose upon the Stocking Shed on Tuesday afternoon, and the Shed was devoured by the score of 5-0. Herb, who did the pitching for the Menagerie, was very hungry, and could not be satisfied. He not only mowed the Shed down in one two three order, but also cracked out a couple of hits, one of which was a two bagger. Freddie, the catcher, had a good appetite with the bat, stowing away a two bagger and a triple. Jor also contributed a two bagger. â€˜Tommy, who did the twirling for the shed, was hit hard when hits were needed. The game was devoid of any interesting features, with the possible exception of two double plays by Jack, third baseman of the Shed, which the umpire refused to allow. The umpire was wrong in both instances, as the fielder does not have to tag the runner, only the bag, when there is a man on first and second; the man on second being forced. The Shed was very weak with the stick, and along with the fine defensive work of the Cubs in the field, the Shed was helpless; not a man getting to third base. While at the bat, 5293 jumped in front of the ball, and was called out.
