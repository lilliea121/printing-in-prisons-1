NINTH EAT DUCKLINGS July 7 Our own Dauntless Ducky, led his little band of untried heroes out today to meet the gory-handed Ninth phalanx in mortal combat. One look at that grim body of veteran warriors was enough for the Shedites, however, for then their nerve began to ooze out, and perhaps is still a oozing. When the clouds of battle had lifted, a portion of the Ducklings were still to be seen; others had fled, but, unfortunately the two umpires, Jack and Happy survived the onslaught, though at times their situation was most precarious. The carnage was dreadful, and the toll a sad one. Ninth 7 Shed 0. â€”Mitch.
