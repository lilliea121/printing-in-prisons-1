BAND 3 SHED 2

July 3 4

Despite several doubtful decisions by
the two umpires, the Band got away
with its game with the Shed, to-day by
the score 8-2.

Neither Ducky or Ban, the opposing
moundsmen got down to real work until
the third inning, at which time the game
was won and lost; there being no other
tallies throunghout the remainder of the
session.

Asg they stand at present, these teams
are almost evenly matched, and any
series in which they take part together
should prove interesting, even if they do
lack brilliancy. â€” Mitch.
