PLASTERERS— LIBRARY TIE.

June 11

J Yaller, the long-legged moundsman of
the Librarians was batted all around the
grounds for 6 runs in the 1st inning of
to-day’s game, after which he settled
down and with good support, prevented
any of the Plasterites from making fur-
ther scores.

Tony started in the box for the Plas-
terers, but was relieved by Curly in the
fourth. The Librarians scattered their
runs throughout the 7 innings and large-
ly through the clever work of Wade and
Big Six, overtook their opponents, but,
could not pass them. The game was an
exciting one throughout, and both teams
realized at the finish, that they had been
in a battle. Score 6—6. —Sam.PLASTERERS— LIBRARY TIE.
