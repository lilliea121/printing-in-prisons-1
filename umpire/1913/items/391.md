The Shed went down to defeat but there is nothing to reproach them with. Eggie, the first man to face Ducky, drove the ball for a two-bagger, and crossed the plate on Lefty's sacrifice, later on he had a home run, and a single, to his credit, scoring two of the four runs for the Ninth. Smithy also had a home run, and a two-bagger, to be added to his average. Lefty and Cap, each fell off in their batting. as neither had a hit during the game. John, a new man, excelled for the Shed, at the third sack, also having a three-bagger, and a single to his credit. Ducky, and Longie, both pitched gilt edge ball, having seven strike outs a piece. John Henry officiated behind the bat, assisted on the bases by Ken. Score, Ninth 4, Shed 0. â€” Bill.
