Try SmilingWhen the weather suits you not Try smilingWhen your coffee isn't hot, Try smilingWhen your neighbors don't do right Or your relatives all fight,Sure it's hard but then you mightTry smiling.Doesn't change the things of course,Just smiling; But it cannot make them worse-Just smiling And it seems to help your case,Brightens up a gloomy place; Then it sort o' rests your face-Just smiling.-Selected.
