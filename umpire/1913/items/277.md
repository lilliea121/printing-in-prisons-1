FOUND

The following correspondence, evident-
ly a copy of a letter and a reply thereto,
was found on the Ninth Block. Owner
may have same by applying in person ton
this office.

My dearest Uncle :—If you could see
how I blush for shame as T am writing
thig, you would pity me. Why, because
I must ask you for the loan of twenty
five dollars, and I do not know how to
express myself, it is impossible for me
to tell you, indeed I would prefer to die.
I send you this by special delivery and
await an immediate reply. Believe me
my dearest Uncle, your most obedient
and affectionate Nephew,

Jack.

P. S.— Overcome with remorse at
what I have written, I have been pound-
ing on the door for the past fifteen min-
utes to get the Overseer, and have him
return my letter. Heaven grant that he
may lose the letter, or something else
prevent same from reaching you.

The second letter reads:

My dear Jack:—Console yourself, and
Providence has heard
your prayer. The Overseer lost your
letter.

Your affectionate Uncle,
—H. F. M.
