CHARGE OF YE BASEBALL FANS.

ALLS in front of them, balls behind,
Balls in their pockets, ball on their minds
Balls in their right hand, also their left,
Some of the ball fans will commit a ball theft.
Balls in the air, balls on the ground,
Balls lost and stolen, some of them found.

Charge ’em ye swat-men, give ’em the stick,
We don’t give a piffle for the pitcher’s sharp wit,
Stick to your slab, he’ll send ’em right over,
Then slam it out hard, where the Humming
Birds hover ;
Beat it to first, then to second you thunder,
Rest not at third, or at home you will blunder.
