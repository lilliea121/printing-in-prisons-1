NINTH BEATS BAND

June 13.

While the Band was beaten by the
Ninth this afternoon by the decisive
score of 11-8, they put up the best game
of ball they have played for many days.
They put Big Louie in the box, and he
did much Dbetter than was expected,
though he was hit in lively shape in the
third and sixth inning; Cap, Yeap and
Lefty knocking out home runs. Eddie,
the Band, plays earn-
est and effective ball, but, he needs
coaching in the rules and finer points of
the game. — Mitch,NINTH BEATS BAND
