Pointed Puns

““You’ve made a mistake in your pa-
per,’”’ said the indignant man, entering
this office, the other day. ‘I was only a
spectator last season, and you said I was
a scout.”’

‘Well, wasn’t you,”’ said Timmie.

¢“N-0,”” replied Duckie, ‘‘and its con-
foundedly awkward, because, you see,
I’m on a regular team, this season.

Warden: ‘‘Did you find anything on
the prisoner when you searched him?”’

)

Overseer: ‘‘ Almost a wagon load of
finely written paper.’’
Warden: ‘‘Hold him till we find out

if he is doing ‘crooked work’ or only a
reporter on the UmMPIRE.”’

““What sort of a newspaper have you
here,”” inquired the recently arrived
stranger. :

““Well,”” frankly admitted the Editor,
“‘many of the brighte-t writers in here
are regular contributors to the UMPIRE,
without knowing it.”’
