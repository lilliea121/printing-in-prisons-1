Gathered in Passing

We are threatened with the loss of a
subseription because we are neglecting
Blink, the pressman; and this in
spite of the fact that we have sent out

Certain it is, that every man who does
not benefit the world by living will bene-
fit it by dying. Don’t spend your life
regretting the past, complaining of the
present, and indulging in false hopes of

the-future. Get busy and create some-
thing useful, or do something useful, or

say something useful.

Population is increasing faster than is
rroduction. Many people eat who do
not work. ‘The cities are overcrowded,
and the farms are underworked. We
are using luxuries, and but few of us
are producing necessities. Many are

riding autos and motor cycles, and few
are growing vegetables, raising cattle,
and making clothes. Is it any wonder
that prices are so high all over the world.Gathered in Passing
