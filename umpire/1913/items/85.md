WHAT's THE SCORE TO-DAY? There was a time when if we met a friend upon the street,He talked on common themes, --the war, the cold, or else the heat,And took an interest in one's healthThat time is passed awayNow no one asks us how we do butWhat's the score today?These words pervade the atmosphere,At weddings, funerals, balls,No matter where; upon your earThe anxious question falls.You go to see the kiddo you love, Your cares to drive away;You kiss, yum yum, and then she says; Oh! What's the score today?If the "Sand Hog's Dubs" are in the lead,What good for me to know?I'd like to play with the "Miners"But I am status quo;And so I hate the joyous cryAnd long to soar away,Back to the jungles where no one asks; What's the score today?--Tingles
