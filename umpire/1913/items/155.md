Looking Them OverGee ! but it's tough to be on the benchWatching the others making good!Full of ambition that naught can quench.Longing to be there swinging the wood! Cheering a guy whose job you crave, who pulls a wonderful stop and peg;A thought crops up you cannot stave "Gee! if he would only break a leg!"
