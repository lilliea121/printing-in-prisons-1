Some miscreant deliberately pilfered a run each from the winning column of the Shed and Library last week, and was detected too late for restoration. However the winning runs have been returned in this week's-issue of the UMPIRE without loss to the clubs. The only excuse the rascal had to offer for his villainous act, was " that they were only, little no-account games anyhow."
