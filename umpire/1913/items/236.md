NINTH vs SHED

Jnne Gth.

The Tiger’s, the Ninth, had to work
hard to beat the Shed team to-day al-
though the latter did not score. Ducky,
struck out eight tigers, and kept the hita
scattered except in the first and fifth
Innings.

Umpires—Eddie, Happy. Eddie leaves
us; good-bye! Score 8—0. Rocky.
