That ought to make angel food but, it won't.While the principle ingredient of a chicken pie, is chicken, it does not necessarily follow that dog should enter into the make up of a dog biscuit.John had just returned from a fishing trip with a string of very small fish."Say, John," remarked his wife. "Don't fish go in schools?" "Sure" replied John."Then all I've got to say that you must have been fishing in the infant class."- B 6491Keep your temper; nobody wants it.Dentist to Jingles : I guarantee to extract teeth without pain.Jingles to Dentist: Yes but I want the pain extracted.
