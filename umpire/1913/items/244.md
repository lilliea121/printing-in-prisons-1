SAID TO BE FUNNY

Let us be thankful for occasional visits from the man
who sees the funny side of things.

Had some of the men in this place
worked as hard for a pay-roll when they
had the opportunity, as they do for a
pa-role here, things would be decidedly
different.

The Government is beating up the Egg
and Butter Trust. That ought to make
angel food but, it won’t.

While the principle ingredient of a
chicken pie, is chicken, it does not nec-
essarily follow that dog should enter
into the make up of a dog biscuit.

. John had just returned from a fishing
trip with a string of very small fish.

“Say, John,” remarked his wife.
“Don’t fish go in schools?’” “‘Sure’’ re-
plied John.

““Then all I’ve got to say that you must
have been fishing in the infant class.”’

Keep your temper; nobody wants it.

Dentist to Jingles : I guarantee to
extract teeth without pain.

Jinglées to Dentist: Yes but I want
the pain extracted. I'd rather keep the
tooth.

A young Sunday school teacher desir-
ing to impress upon the minds of her
class, the meaning of returning thanks,
before a meal, asked the deacon’s son
the following:

‘“George what is the first thing your
father says when he sits down %to the
table?"’

He says, “‘Go slow, with the butter
kids, it’s forty cents a pound,” replied
George.
