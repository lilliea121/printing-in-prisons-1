PLASTERERS WIN

June 23

After a weeks cessation of ball-play,
and amid most salubrious couditions,
the teams came up smiling. It was im-
mediately perceptible that the Plasterers
had not been idly wasting their time,
but had taken advantage of the recess
to reinforce their team with some well
known players from other teams. No
doubt they would be glad to see the ulti-
mate issue pan out in their favor.

To-day, the Plasterers made terrible
havoc with their opponents, and appar-
ently are as much to be feared as ever.

Yaller, one of their new acquisitions,
was on the hill, and put up a great bat-
tle, and the runs they piled up were
legion.

The game was virtually finished after
the 1st inning was played. That ardent
player Andy, with his finger still in plas-
ter, was in great form, and scored very
cleverly. While we were pleased to see
him out, we nevertheless think him ill
advised to take chances so soon after his
reverse.

Iveryone of the players put in some
meritorious work, and the following
are the men who ran the score up

62 "dozen. Felix, Toney, Alec,

blush no more.

Harry and Yaller, each scored a brace;
Barber and Andy scored one each.

Eor the first time in the history of the
E. S. P. B. B. League, the old ‘War-

| rior’’ was seen taking things easy. Peo-

ple could hardly believe their own eyes,
when he was discovered smoking a
Havana, and intently watching the 9th
vs. Library contest. Doubtless he had
got wind of the great benders the Li-
brary’snew pitcher has up his sleeve.
The Stocking Shed were battered about
unmercifully, and it was grievous to see
Ducky’s bombardment culminate in ut-
ter failure. Jimmy scored on Spetz’s
hit, and that was the end of their ex-
ploit. Many times that young aspirant
has come to the rescue, and it wlll be a
sorry day for them if they ever lose his
services.

Outside of the fierce onslaught upon
the ball, the game was devoid of in-
terest, because when teams are so unev-
enly matched, as these were to-day, it
naturally follows that all interest must
be eliminated. —Henry.PLASTERERS WIN
