BASE-BALL NUT

He really didn’t know just how the Yankees conquered
Spain.
And FEdgar Allen Poe to him was new:
If you asked him-—well, he couldn’t tell the history of
the Maine;
How Napoleon had met his Waterloo;
He had traveled all through college, and he knew with
all his knowledge,
That in life he was nothing but a boobh.
But with all his faults at learning, and his aptitude at
earning,
He knew the greatest batter’s name was—-RUBE,

To him the siege of Gettysburg was nothing but1 a
myth :
He never knew that Bryan’s name was I ill;
He wouldn’t stand for Shakespeare, and he never
bothered with
Thomas Fdison, or other men of skill:
Bob Fitzsimmons was a piker, Hetty Green, he didn’t
like her,
Teddy Roosevelt-—well he thought was rather early.
But he’d probably astound you, yes, he’d hammer and
propound you,
With the lightening pill propensities of---CURI,Y

His taxes weren't settled, and he never went to vote,
It really was a waste of precious time;
He simply couldn't see, why the smile on Qualker Oats,
Didn’t have instead, a funny base-ball rhyme:
At golf he couldn’t revel, and at races, on the level
Say, he didn’t know a race-horse from an ape,
But for all his ways erratic, he contained within his attic,
The biography of GEORGE WASHINGTON YEAP.
(I, envoi)
Thus he drifted on through life, and in the good old
summer time,
His existence on this earth was like a dream,
And at night when all was over, he would picture in _hig
min
Slippery Jordan, pickin' balls from off the screen;
Yellow Waguner, Iittle Freddie, ILongie and Big Jack—
Breakfast, dinner, supper ; morning, noon and night,
Thus he raved until they got him, and safely took bhim
ack
To his number twenty-two, in the third block on the
right.
