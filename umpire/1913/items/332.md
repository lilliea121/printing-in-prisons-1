NEW COMMANDMENTS

These are commandments new and Ten.
Which wives lay down to married men:
I—Remember that I am thy wife,

Whom thou must cherish all thy life,
Sure Thing.
IT—Remember ‘tis thy duty clear,
To dress me well throughout the year.
Of course, dear.
III—My cooking thou shalt not despise,
And shall with pleasure praise iny pies.
We'll see.
1V—My shalt strive to
please,
And let her live with us in ease,
My, Oh! My.
V—It shall be thy duty mild and meek,
To give me thy wages every week.
Oh, the nerve.
VI—Thou shalt not flirt, but mmust allow,
Thy wife this privilege anyhow.
More nerve.
VII—Thou shalt get up when baby cries,
And try the child to tranguilize.
Oh! my.
VIII—Thou shalt not be a drinking man,
But live on the Prohibition plan.
What next?
IX—Thou shalt not stay out late at night,
When clubs and lodges do invite.
Women dare never vote.
X-—Friends thou shalt number very few,

mother thou

Allmust be handsome, sincere, and

true. That’s us.
These my commandments from day to
day,

Implicitly thou must obey.
