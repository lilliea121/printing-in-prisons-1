A CORRESPONDENT of a local paper agrees with the Umpire in attaching the blame for the cigarette habit among boys to the fathers, rather than to the poor keeper of a little shop who is trying to mike an honest dollar. He says: * * * * * Official records will show that within a few years the death of many boys has been caused by the use of cigarettes. Boys, of course, are blamable for smoking, but the chief blame must rest upon the fathers, and it should rest upon them with a very heavy weight, for it is due to them in a great measure that the boys get into the habit.
