PLEASANTRIES, A Prison Garden. Y ample needs in garden seeds Now occupy my mind. I simply pant to go and plant A peck of every kind. The pumpkin vine, I think is fine, To yams I also lean; I fairly love the fine points of The onion and the bean. The marrow fat must grace my plat, I want the squash and leek. For early roots and thrifty shoots Assiduously I seek. I want the pieplant and the prune, The radish and the beet. But how can I plant all this in A plat of four square feet? â€”Selected.
