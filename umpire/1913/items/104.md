NINTH vs PLASTERERS
April 23
The Ninth met the Plasterers for the
second time this year, and the result was
-reversed; the Ninth bringing home the
bacon by the score of 7—1. Longie start-
ed the game, and was going fine, but
was releived by Bill in the fourth, who
held the Plasterers scoreless. Curly, as
usual, was on the firing line for the
‘““Mud Slingers,’”’ but was not very effect-
ive. Rube is still stinging the ball, hav-
ing a home run and a two bagger. This
makes four home runs in three games
—Mr. Baker, take notice.

The umpires should stop Dave from
stepping in front of the ball. 'We do not
mind him getting his base so much, but
we are afraid he will be out of the game
through injuries, and that would be far
worse a blow to the Plasterers, than the
blow he received on his arm. After the
Plasterers went out in order in their first

half, the Ninth got to Curly from the
start. Lefty waited for four wide ones,
and Rube followed with a home run over
the roof. Stump dropped Cap’s fly, but
Cap, was doubled up, when Slick, by
poor head work hit at the first ball over.
Fatty making a nice catch, doubling
up Cap. at first. Longie is suprising
everyone by his hitting this year. He
came through with a home run this
game. The Plasterers were very weak
with the stick, not getting a ball beyond
second base. Dave played his usual
good game, likewise Curly, who fielded
his position good, taking everything
that came his way. Dave’s ¢ WHITE
HOPE" was seen warming up around by
the burner, but for some reason, best
known to himself, must have been
very chilly, as he was still there when
the whistle blew. —TimmyNINTH vs PLASTERERS
