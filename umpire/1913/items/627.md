WHO'S WHO In MacKentieville Who roasts the "gang" in senseless thyme, to please his pals, and pass the time? Who grinds out poetry by the yard, and has grabbed the palm from Poet, bard? Who looks for a niche in the Hall of Fame, and in black-face type, wants to see his name? Who fakes at fixing our little skylights, which leak just the same on rainy nights? Who soon will be a rank "outsider?" Why that creeping gent, that, gentle Spider.
