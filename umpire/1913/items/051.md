Local Squibs
Wednesday, April 9, 1913.

Hurrah | The season has opened.

WANTED.—At once. Farm hand and
musician. Apply B4209, Band.

The '‘Ragtime Wop’’ has been called
on to play in Dave’s place. He says:
“I willa doa da besta I cana.’”’

After warming up for three years,
Herman of the Band Team, went in the
box last week and beat the Library.

Dave, manager of the Band Team, is
out of the running for time being, hav-
ing split his finger in a practice game
last week.

We hope by the time this week’s Um- |

PIRE 18 on the press, that Mr. Enckler
will be back at his old place on the
Center.

The poet Jingles says he has come to
stay. He denied that he was connected
with any other paper, when interviewed
by a reporter of the UmpIrE, lately.

“Felix,”” of the Plasterers, won the
crowd by his playing at first base, in that
practice game with the Ninth Block last
week. That boy is some player, believe
me.

The members of the E. 8. P. League
take this opportunity, through the Uwm-
PIRE, to thank Superintendent Loan, of
the Store House, for furnishing the clnbs
with tape upon its arrival.

Spider says he will have his hands full
this season collecting balls off the roof—
‘““Dave the Plasterer’”” was overheard

talking to Spider: ‘“Will that be O. K.”’

““I gotcha,’’ said Spider.

Some one, they say, told Capt. Smith |

that during the opening game between
the Library and Band; one of the Band
tellows stole two bases—Capt. wanted to
know why he wasn’t locked up.

During a session of Mr. Bonsall’s

grammar class last week, he asked a new
scholar to write a sentence on the black-
board and this is what he wrote: ‘‘Not
1ess than 19 nor more than 20.”’ Rather
a long sentence for a fellow who has been
to school but two days.Local Squibs
