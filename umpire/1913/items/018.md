Phillies Won in Ninth

Durham, N. C.

The Phillies won out by a hair over
the Durham club of the Carolina League
here today. In the 9th inning, with the
score 4 to 3 in favor of Durham, things
looked bad for the Phillies. Magee, first
up, hit a long fly to left field. Kelly
booted Miller’s grounder, and this start-
ed things going. Dolan sacrificed him
to second, and Dooin selected himself to
bat for Dodge and slammed out a two
bagger, which put across the tying run,
and then La Longe ordered the same
thing and Dooin scored on his two
bagger.

“Wild Bill” Donovan, formerly of
Detroit, and now manager of Providence
of the International League, which is
here training, umpired the game. Score
4 to 3.Phillies Won in Ninth
