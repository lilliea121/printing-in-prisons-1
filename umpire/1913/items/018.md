Phillies Won in Ninth

Durham, N. C.

The Phillics won out by a hair over
the Durham club of the Carolina League
here today. In the9th inning, with the
score 4 to 3 in favor of Durham, things

looked bad for the Phillies. Magee, first

up, hit a long fly to left field. Kelly
booted Miller’s grounder, and this stars-
ed things going. Dolan sacrificed him
to second, and Dooin selected himself to
bat for Dodge and slammed out a two
bagger, which put across the tying run,
and then La Longe ordered the same
thing and Dooin scored on his two
bagger.

“Wild Bill”” Donovan, formerly of
Detroit, and now manager of Providence
of the International League, which is
here training, umpired the game. Score
4 to 3.
