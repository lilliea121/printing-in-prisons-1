Baseball

The days have come, for hits and runs,
For aches and sores, for wordy wars,
In Baseball.

The clubs in line, all show up fine,
There is no sign, of losing time
At Baseball.

The Ninth looks fit, and say they’re It,
They field and hit, but wait a bit
Its Baseball.

The Stocking Shed, are far from dead,
They go ahead, and talk in bed
Of Baseball.

And in the Band, the boys play grand,
Have they the sand, to make a stand,
At Baseball?

The Plasterer team they always seem,
To have the steam, and are real keen,
For Baseball.

The Librar-y, on the gal-ler-y
Have signed a plea, the flag to see,
That’s Baseball.

The Cubslook wise, and wink their eyes,
And for their size, they may surprise,
At Baseball.

Now watch and wait, its near the date
To pass the ‘‘gate’’, and gee the plate.
And Baseball.

If the team you pick, don’t get their lick
Please don’t get sick, orraise a kick.
It’s Baseball.
