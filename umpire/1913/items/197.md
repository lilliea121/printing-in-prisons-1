THE PLOT THICKENS.

Des Moines Ike, suddenly emerging
from the other end of the subway, saw
Raffles enter the town of Richmond.

Ike and the policeman carried Raffles’
foot-print to the ¢Six Little Tailors’’
for measurement. Then Ike jumped
into the deep shadows of Moyamensing.
He was afterinspiration. The tintinna-
bulation of the patrol wagons reminded
him of the fact that the farmers were
having a picnic in Pitman, New Jersey.
With a spring, Ike boarded a Darby car,
and, in ten minutes’ arrived in Pitman.
He whispered to the speaker of the day,
and then hid behind the bass drum.
The speaker addressed the farmers.
Fellow citizens, we have in our midst
to-day, a man with a world-wide repu-
tation as a detective; a man who never
accepted a bribe. I refer to Des Moines
Ike, the great investigator. Everyone
in the crowd stopped eating straw, ex-
cept Omar Stubbles.

Lynx-eyed Ike saw Omar and recog-
nized him as a notorious free-holder, as
the one who kidnapped Irene, the Bur-
gomaster’s daughter. He decided to
follow Omar to his lair.

‘When Omar tested all the rain-bowish
lemonades in town, he started for home
Omar’s old mare was on strike, and that’s
why Omar started to walk seven miles
inland to his home. Ike crept after
him. His knees were still sore from
creeping through the subway.

Why didn’t Omar take a train? Adri-
anople was taken; Constantinople should
be, but no man ever took a train, besides,
the trains run through Pitman just to
make a short cut to other towns. Ike
never lost sight of Omar. When they
arrived near a dark patch of woods, Ike
made a peculiar noise. Omar turned
quickly and, putting hand to hip pocket,

pulled out a pork chop. Soon as
Ike saw that valuable heir-loom he re-

called the great ‘‘Stock Yards Robbery.’” -

Ike thought swiftly. He recognized
that Armour plated piece of Radium.
At all costs he must recover it. Ike of-
fered Omar ten million dollars for it,
Omar reflected a bit and said, ‘“I have
seventeen children to hum and refuse
the offer, I am only waiting till meat ad-
vances a point, then I’ll sell and put
seven million dollars in trust for each of
my children.”’
