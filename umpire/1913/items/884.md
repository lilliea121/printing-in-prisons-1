IN THE EDITORIAL on the Bertillon System in last week's issue, we stated that the fact of a man having been convicted and served time before is not an indictable offense. We were wrong, and hasten to correct the error. The Editor by the merest chance ran across an item in a recent issue of a daily paper from which it appears that one term in prison is not sufficient to expiate certain crimes in this State. It says: T.S.— It is against the law fora pickpocket to be found in a crowd whether he is practicing his profession or not. The penalty is imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days. If your protégé has served time for picking pockets, we would advise that he shun crowds. This statute has been held to be constitutional.
