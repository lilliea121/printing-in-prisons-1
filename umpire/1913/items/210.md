Who is the quoit champion ?

Break up games with the bat and not
guff.

Those Cubs are certainly playing some
ball. Two straight from the Library,
with prospects of another.

Walter Johnson of the Washington’s
has broken all records by pitching 56
consecutive no-hit innings.

Someone asked Dave the cornet player
how the Band Team was getting along.
“Sh’’ said Dave, ‘‘Take off your hat
when you speak of the dead.”’

The games scheduled for last Wed-
nesday afternoon, were called off by the
Weather man and will be played next
Thursday instead.

The Athletics took four games from
the Yarkees last week, and in order to
allow Philadelphia business men to trans-
act their business peacefully in New
York, the Phillies dropped four to the
Giants.

Both Ty Cobb and Johnny Evers can
afford to take a chance in rowdy ball
playing, but there is not a player in the
entire E. S. P. League who can do the
same, and get away with it. “Don’t butt
a stone wall.”’
