NINTH vs STOCKING SHEDApril 30 When Ducky went against the Ninth on Monday in the six inning, and let the Ninth down with one hit, his manager booked him to pitch the next game against the Ninth on Wednesday. For four innings he pitched gilt-edge ball, and but for errors by his team mates, would have been ahead. The Shed got two runs, both being homers over the roof. 5293 getting one in the second, and 5558 in the sixth. A ball was hit over the end wall for the first time this season, and Cap of the Ninth did the trick. Just before the whistle blew, Longie hit one over the roof for another homer. With the exception of Longie, at first base, the Ninth fielded faultlessly, and Jack did not exert himself in the box. Ducky was not hit as hard as the score indicates; ragged support letting in most of the runs. Jack, Slick, and Cap. hit two baggers. —Timmy
