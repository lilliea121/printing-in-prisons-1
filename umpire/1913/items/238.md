CUBS vs STOCKING SHED

June 9.
Very uneventful was the game played
today between the above teams, and it
ended in a win for the Cubs, 7-1.
Everybody seemed to be in a state of
lethargy, and indifferent to which way
the ball went. Ducky who has been
pitching so consistently of late is being
overworked, and to that we attribute
his poor pitching today. He was off
the bull’s eye and let many men oceupy
bases on balls. We have seen Tommy
pitch better, and we must attach the
same reason to his handling of the sphere
The Cubs in the 2nd inning opened the
scoring with Tommy hitting a two bag-
ger, stole 3rd, and scoring on an error.
Butt was walked, stole 2nd and 3rd and
scored on Stew’s sacrifice. Marty got
to 3rd and faded. In 3rd inning they

bunched a quantity of runs and thus

settled the Shed’s hash.

Charley passed, stole 2nd and 3rd and
scored on Tommie's two-bagger obtained
by a wild throw; Tommie stole 3rd and
scored on Butts double, as did Jor who
had secured his base on balls. Butt
scored on Woody’s 2 bagger who faded
at 3rd. After this nothing noteworthy
happened. — Henry.
