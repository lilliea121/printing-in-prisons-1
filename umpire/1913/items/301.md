PLASTERERS VS STOCK. SHED

June 25

With Rabbi on the mound for the
Stocking Shed, and Yaller for the Plas-
terers, they opened their second game of
the series to-day, which was very inter-
esting all through. Sharp fielding and
good hitting were demonstrated by both
sides. The Rabbi hit Aleck, the first
man up, with his first delivery, which
caused a little commotion among the
players, but he later settled down and
pitched star ball. Stump walked and
and scored on Tony’s hit, and the latter
scored on a wild pitech, which netted 2
runs for the Plasterers in the first in-
ning. Big Six would not step aside for
one of Yaller's cannon balls, and drove
1t for a home run, over the roof. In the
second inning both sides went out in or-
der. In the third inning, Felix and Jim
scored for the Plasterers, the Stocking
Shed going out in order. Ducky made
a very difficult and daring catch of a fly
in the middle of the twelfth Block door-
way, which saved another run from go-
ing home.

In the fourth inning; Jim made a
slashing triple, and scored on Harry’s
single, which surprised the crowd. The
Shed again went out in order.

In the fifth inning, Toney singled; Fel-
ix flied to Ducky; Mike fanned; and
Tony scored on Andie’s hit. For the
Stocking Shed, 6473 fanned; Ducky
drove a hot liner to Tony, and the Rabbi
singled. Fingers hit a two-bagger, scor-
ing Rabbi.

The 6th inning had just begun when
the whistle blew, leaving the Plasterers
victorious by the score of 6—2.

Both sides were in exceilent shape,
Yaller having 9 strike outs against Rab-
bi’s 5.  Rabbi walked one, and hit one.
Umpires, Happy—Big Jack.
