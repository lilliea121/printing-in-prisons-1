InformationDear David, Greetings:Can it be that your twenty-one inning pitcher is sick? We do not wish to think so, and yet what else can prevent you from putting him in the box. We have not a thought that yon are saving said pitcher for the series, and yet we are sometimes haunted by a vague fear that all is not right. Just one game, dear David, and our little hearts will be filled with sunshine.Ever yours in sport, Anxious.
