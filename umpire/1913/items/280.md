Oh! Glorious Flag!

Heralding afar, thy message of freedom bright

To Nations great, throughout the world—

Proclaiming guardianship of the lowly and oppres’t, *

Under whose starry vigilance, o’er wrought mankind

Oh'! |
Emblem of Right, as well as Might—
Thyv fluttering folds to the winds unfurl’d, ‘

may find rest. |

Oh! may thy stars be ever, as firmly set,

As those in Heaven’s vast firmanent.
