SOME DON’TS FOR UMPIRES.

Don’t argue over decisions with play-
ers; tell them to play ball.

Don’t fail to keep your eye on the ball.

Don’t ask a player if he was out, after
you’ve called him out.

Don’t pay any attention to remarks
from spectators—it is for their benefit
you are umpiring; if they become too
strong, report them to the Overseer.

Don’t try to justify yourself after the

game, you are only adding fuel—it is

useless anyway.

Don’t be afraid of asking the other
umpire, if you are in doubt.

Don’t be afraid of changing your de-
cision when you know you’re wrong. It
is all rot about an umpire can not change
his decision, when he sees he’s wrong—
but do it quickly.

Don’t let the players delay the game—
use your authority.

Don’t be afraid of losing your friends
if you are right—that’s how some of us
landed here.

Don’t call a ball a strike just to even

up when you’ve missed.

Don’t mind if one team says your rot-
ten—the other team thinks you’re fine.

Don’t, if umpiring bases, fail to fol-
low up the plays.

Don’t, for heaven sake, lose your head.
