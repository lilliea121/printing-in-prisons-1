It is very true that the Star Spangled
Banner is the insignia of the ‘‘land of
the brave and the home of the free’’ but,
this paper is in a position to state au-
thoritatively, that the Warden had mno
intention of perpetrating a joke, when
he ordered that ‘‘beautiful rag’’ flung to
the breezes, over the centre turret.
