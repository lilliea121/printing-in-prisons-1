Yaller has entirely recovered from
his recent sudden illness, and will soon
be able to resume his place in the box
for the Plasterers. Heis a quiet, steady,
conscientious worker, who has earned
many friends.

Prof. Wiegandt has secured the second
floor of the Stocking Shed building for
use as a Band room. Itisa great im-
provement over the old quarters, in the
matter of light, room and favorable
acoustics. The men are equally as well
pleased with the new surroundings as
the Band-master.
