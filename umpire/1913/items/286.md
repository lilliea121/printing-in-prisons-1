A man without ambition is lik= a bird
without wings. He can never s=oar in
the heights above, but must walk like a
weakling, unnoticed, with the crowd be-
low.—Walter H. Cottingham.

Shun idleness, it is the rust that at-
taches itself to the most brilliant metals.

The secvet of success is the constancy
of purpose.—Disracli.

Silence is golden.-—To speak wisely
may not always be easy,—but not to
speak ill requires only silence.
