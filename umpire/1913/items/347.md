SHED LOSE 3 STRAIGHT

uly 11

: It was no hard matter to obtain a seat
in the grand stand to-day to see the
combat between the 9th and Shed, Dbe-
cause nearly everybody had migrated
to the Stable ground in the expectancy
of seeing the Cubs perform the hat trick
upon the old veterans, which inciden-
tally did not come to pass.

Longie and Duckie pitched respect-
ively and from the completion of the 1st
inning there was no chance of the Shed
winning. 13 runs were aggregrated and
10 of them wentto the Ninth’s credit;
John (3), Eggie (2), Lefty (2), Augie,

Longie and Betts.

Duckie tried his best to keep the score
down, but it was in vain that he hurled
the sphere. He with Bob and Spetz
made a trio of runs. — Henry.
