SIT ON THE LID AND LAUGH. Build for yourself a strong box, Fashion each part with care, And when it's as strong as hands can make it, Put all your troubles there, Hide all the thoughts of failures, And each bitter cup that you quaff, Lock all your heartaches within it, And sit on the lid and laugh. Tell no one of its contents, " Never its secrets share, When in it you drop your care and worry Keep them forever there, Hide them from sight so completely, That the world will never dream half, Fasten the strong box securely, And sit on the lid and laugh. â€”Jingles.
