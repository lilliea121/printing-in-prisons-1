Pointed Puns

Why He Stopped.

‘““‘Windley doesn’t play the cornet any
more, does he ?”’

“No ; he thought he’d better give it
up 29

“‘Bad for his lungs, eh ?”’

‘“‘No ; it wasn’t that. One of the
neighbors shot two keys off the instru-
ment while he was playing it.”’

His Motto.

A very small boy applied to a great
merchant for a situation. The great
man sized him up carefully and asked
what position he wanted.

“A chance to grow up in the busi-
ness.”’

““Well, what is your motto, my son?’’

“The same as yours.”’

‘““What do you mean?”’

‘“Why, on the door there—‘Push.’ *’

He got the job.
