SAID TO BE FUNNY

Iet us be thankful for occasional visits from
the man who sees the funny side of things.

In the School-room—

Mr. Bonsall:—Sammy, if your father
borrowed $50 and agreed to pay it back
at the rate of $6 a month, how long
~would it take him to pay?

Sammy:—(confidently) It’d take him
all his life, and den some more.

Mr. Bonsall:—Beat it back to
cell, quick. You're the limit.

Sammy:—(sadly) Ah, Teechur, you
don’ know my fadder. —B 6290.

your

Some Summer Dont’s observed in
MacKentieville :

Don’t mix your drinks.

Don’t drink liquor after eating.

Don’t drink liquor befor eating.

Don’t eat meat and drink milk at the
same meal.

Don’t hurt anybody’s feelings; they
might hurt back.

Mrs. Talkington—Tell me the truth,
Henry, have I a rival ?

Mr. Talkington—Only the phonograph,
my love.
