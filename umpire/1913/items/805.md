CURE FOR TALE-BEARING Take of good nature one ounce; of a herb commonly called by the Indians, mind-your-own-business, an ounce; mix this with a little charity for others and two or three sprigs of keep-your-tongue-between-your-teeth; simmer them together in a vessel called, circumspection for a time, and it will be fit for use. Symptoms:—A violent itching in the tongue and roof of the mouth, which inwardly take place when you are with a kind of being called gossip. DOSE:—When you feel a turn of it coming on, take a teaspoonful of the above, hold it in your mouth, which you should keep closely shut, until you are alone, and you will find a complete cure. Should you apprehend a relapse, keep a phial full about you, and in feeling the slightest symptoms, repeat the dose. —B 6594.
