BAND SLAUGHTERED

The Poet and i‘I—lS Team Were Help-
less in the Hands of the Ninth

In our opinion, only those games,
where either team has a possible chance
of winning, are worth recording; to wit,
the game on Friday last between the
Stocking Shed and the Ninth Block.

In today’s game, one side
earthly chance.

With all due respect to the Band and
their pitchers who did their level best to
combat their opponents, but without a-
vail, we feel bound to assert that unless
they can dig up some strong twirler,
their prospects will be absolutely hope-
less when they come in contact with the
premier teams.

Today’s game was merely practice for
the Ninth, and it would not be paying
them much of a compliment to record
the individual plays.

Suffice it to say, Longy made 3 home
runs, in two of which he brought in 6
runs. The Ninth used their most formid-
able battery, whioch was unneccessary,
and which should be enough to account
for the result—which was 21-—1 in their
favor.

1t seemed to us that nearly everybody
made a home run, and the diamond
gave us the impression of being on a
running race track.
