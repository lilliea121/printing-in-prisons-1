NOTICE

â€˜We ask the co-operation of the manag-
ers and players, toaid the official scorers
as much as possible, by obtaining for
them a good vantage point in which to
witness all the plays; a so to give them
your correct batting list, and any chang-
es which may occur during the game,
Itis to your benefit that you should do
this, if you wish a correct account kept
of the batting, fielding and base running
during the season. The work of an
official scorer is rather an intricate and
troublegome one, and mistakes will no
doubt occur, bnt with the help of the
managers players, and umpires, a great
many of them can be eliminated.
