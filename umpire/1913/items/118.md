STOCKING SHED 7, BAND 2

MAY 1

A protested game was played between
the above teamg. Many walked to first
on account of it being May first. ‘Tom-
my, pitcher, should cultivate control, as
he has the goods. A little more exper-
ience, and a required knack of mixing
them up, will put you in the top class,
your home run was a beauty. Josh en-
gineered a neat double play singled hand-
ed. Stocking Shed hit hard and timely.
Two Band pitchers knocked out, and the
third groggy. The game was replete with
sins of commission and omission. In-
fusion of new blood will help the
Bandits.

A running catch of a fly was made by
some player, whose name I didn’t catch
—although he caught the ball. —Rocky
