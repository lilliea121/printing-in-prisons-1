CUBS WIN TIE FROM BANDJuly 31 The tie game between the Cubs and Band on Wednesday afternoon was played off today and resulted in favor of the former by the score of 4 to 0. Only one hit was secured off Tommy, who was in the box for the Cubs, and that was a clean two-bagger by Joe, formerly of the Library, who made his first appearance with the Band. Three times the Bandmen had a player on third, but, each time the necessary hit was lacking to bring them across the plate. A good-natured little lump of darkness, called Ike, did the pitching for the Band, and did it well, holding the Cubs' heavy swatters down to five hits, four of which were two-baggers. He also executed a brilliant double play in the fourth, when he caught a red hot liner from Butt's bat, with one hand, and then nailed Marty at second. If he were fed up on some rare steak for awhile, he would prove a veritable wonder. The game was extraordinarily well played by both teams, and notable for the quick business like way in which it was carried to a conclusion. Umpire, Mack. --Mitch
