<p>WILL SOMEONE TELL ME</p>
<p>Sometime ago, I thought how fine,
&quot;Twould be to getateam in line,
That really knew just how to play.
Will someone tell me, does it pay:</p>
<p>The first day came, my pitcher fell,
For many days, he wont be well.</p>
<p>My other star, his finger broke,</p>
<p>Will someone tell me where's the joke?</p>
<p>I traded Fggie for Yeap, you know,
And he’s the boy that sure can throw,
But he’s all in, this awful heat,</p>
<p>Will someone tell me, can this be beat?</p>
<p>My other players are O. K.,</p>
<p>To field and hit they know the way,
But somebow we can’t win a game,
Will someone tell me am I to blame?</p>
<p>The Ninth they surely had to fight,</p>
<p>They played the game with all their might.
My boys, they too, were on the spot.</p>
<p>Will someone tell me, how to get on top?</p>
<p>The Cubs were next, we thought we'd win,
But we got ‘“‘ours’’, it wasa sin,</p>
<p>We simply could not hit that Teal,</p>
<p>Will someone tell me, how I feel?</p>
<p>Last week I hoped for better luck,</p>
<p>For ’twas the Band, that we did buck,
But again we lost, now for goodness sake,
Will someone tell me where’sa lake?</p>
<p>But after all is said and done,</p>
<p>Just stick around, and watch the fun;</p>
<p>If we don’t finish, one-two-three, :
Will somieone tell me, where we’ll be?</p>
<p>—Jingles.</p>
