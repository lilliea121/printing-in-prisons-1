CUBS WIN FROM SHED

June 11

In the first four innings of the Cubs-—
Stocking Shed game this afternoon, thir-
teen men faced Ducky, only one of Whom
reached first base, and that one walked.
Seven others were struck out.

In the fifth, the little fellow weakened
and as the Cubs saw it, began to show
their teeth and hit the ball. Those who
couldn’t hit, were passed and four runs
rushed over the plate, at least two of
which could have been cut off had the
catcher been on the job.

The Shed tallied one run in each of
the first two innings, and had a man on
third base, in the third, when Rile, a
new man struck out. After that Tom-
mie held them down to one single hit
Score 4-2.
