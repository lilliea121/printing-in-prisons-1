THE LURE OF INVENTION The lure of invention is one that influences all people and spares no class or condition of men. From the clergyman in his study, to the convict in his lonely cell, it exerts its attraction, and both are found enrolled among the list of patentees although not so precisely identified. The stimulus is not always the hope of fee or reward, for we find the millionaire as strongly interested as the very poor. There is something in the attraction that cannot be resisted. Someone has said that writing is like flirting. If you cannot do it, no one can teach you to do it, and if you can do it, no one can keep you from doing it. So it is with invention; no one can teach you to do it, and if you have the divine afflatus, no one can prevent you from exercising it. While the lure may be regarded apart from the results, we cannot help realizing what a poor world this would be except for the beneficent works of the inventors of all times.
