NINTH vs PLASTERERS

July 3

A game, devoid of interest after the
first inning had been negotiated, was
played to-day between the above teams.

Longy, fresh from a good rest was
pitted against the old ‘“War Horse' .
His pitching was somewhat wild, but
one way or another their opponents were
held down to nil. Curley was in good
form, but weakened a little at times.
The fielding on both sides was good,
Rube, John and Augie made home run
swats. Timmy, Eggy and some one efsé,
each scored, Rube tripled, and Augie
doubled.

For the Plasterers, the Barber got to
third and faded; Alec got to third exceed-
ingly clever, and fooled Longy in the
passing. With all his cuteness he was
immediately caught trying to get away
with a practical impossibility. Through-
out the whole combat, no exciting situa-
tion presented itself. With the excep-
tion of one hit which materialized on
error, Longy pitched a no hit, no run
game. Result 6-0 favor of Ninth,
