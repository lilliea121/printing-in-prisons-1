A Prison Garden.

MY ample needs in garden seeds
Now occupy my mind.

I simply pant to go and plant
A peck of every kind.

The pumpkin vine, I think is fine,
To yams I also lean;

I fairly love the fine points of
The onion and the bean.

The marrowfat must grace my plat,
I want the squash and leek.

For early roots and thrifty shoots
Assiduously I seek.

I want the pieplant and the prune,
The radish and the beet.

But how can I plant all this in
A plat of four square feet?
