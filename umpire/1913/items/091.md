NINTH vs CUBS

April 17

After a week of enforced idleness, due
to the rain, the Cubs again faced the
Ninth, and for the third time went down
to defeat. The weather was perfect,
and alarge crowd was in attendance, in-
cluding two entire Blocks. From the
Ninth’s stand-point, the game was nearly
perfect; Jack and Slick, the battery, do-
ing excellent work. The Cubs pitcher
and catcher also performed well, but had
very poor support in the field.

Neither side scored in the first. In
the second, Jack and Lefty scored on
sacrifice hitsby Yeap and Sam. In the
third, Tim hit for two bases, but was out
stealing home. Brownie hit safe, stole
second and third, and came in on Slick’s
sacrifice. The Cubs failed to score,
Marty dying on third, after making a two
base hit. In the fourth, the Ninth made
another tally, Yeap coming home on a
sacrifice hit by Augie.

In the fifth, the Ninth got five runs off
of Kirkie, after two men wereout. And
in the last, scored another run. The
Cubs could get but three or four men to
first during the whole game, due to the
splendid pitching of Jack, and the good
team work behind him.

The umpire’s decision in the fifth, on
Joe going to second, was very Close; he
looked safe. Final Score 10-0.
