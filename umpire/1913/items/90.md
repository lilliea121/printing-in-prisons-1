Ty Cobb Can Get His PriceTy Cobb, champion batsman of the American League, may become a resident of Chicago, if he fails to come to terms with the management of the Detroit club, according to a telegram sent by him from Augusta, Ga., today.Cobb, replying to an offer of $15,000 a year and an automobile, to act as Chicago agent for an automobile supply company, of Logansport, Ind., said that he was still negotiating with President Navin, of Detroit, but would give a definite answer to the business proposition within ten days.The concern which seeks Cobb's services recently weaned Vincent Campbell a Boston outfielder, from baseball and and placed him in charge of its St. Louis branch.
