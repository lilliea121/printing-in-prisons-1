SHED OUTCLASSED

June 27

The Stocking Shed was helpless in the
hands of the Plasterers to-day, despite
Duckey’s heroic work in the box, and
went down and out to the tune of 8-2.

Curly pitched four innings for the
Plasterers and was ordered out of the
game in the fifth by Happy, for insult-
ing Lippy the base umpire. Yaller then
went in to finish the game, which he did
in a hurry.SHED OUTCLASSED
