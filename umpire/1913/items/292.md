PLASTERERS— LIBRARY TIEJune 11Yaller, the long-legged moundsman of the Librarians was batted all around the grounds for 6 runs in the 1st inning of — Henry. today's game, after which he settled down and with good support, prevented any of the Plasterites from making further scores. Tony started in the box for the Plasterers, but was relieved by Curly in the fourth. The Librarians scattered their runs throughout the 7 innings and largely through the clever work of Wade and Big Six, overtook their opponents, but, could not pass them. The game was an exciting one throughout, and both teams realized at the finish, that they had been in a battle. Score 6—6. —Sam.
