NINTH VS LIBRARY

June 25

A game of only moderate good play,
was the product of the above contest,
and although it was anybody’s game
clear up to the finish, the Ninth were
well established on the winning side.

They used their usual strong line-up;
but they were kept fairly well in hand ;
as regards runs, by the Library.

They scored three runs, two of which
were obtained by Longy; one being a
bounding lick, and the other the outcome
of a three-bagger. Longey batting
much more consistently than he did last
season.

Although his pitching was not ‘‘of the
first water,”” he worked hard, both in
the box and at the bat, aund to him must
be attributed the victory to-day. The

other run was made by Ban, who scored
on Longy’s treble.
The result of the Librarian’s play to-

day was nil, and hardly once, except ¢

when Bob was permitted to occupy third
base, was there the slightest sign of them
scoring. Mike pitched a good game, but
a feeling of unrest was upon the whole
team. —Henry.
