GOOD UMPIRE RESIGNS Neal, who ranks with Denver Eddie as an umpire, handed in his resignation today without stating reasons. The writer tried to fathom the reason, but Neal stands pat. We need all juicy baseball scandals in our business. All players when questioned remained taciturn. Scandal should not be hushed up, as exposure is good for the game. When a player or umpire resigns without apparent reason, you can wager that there is a reason. When friend or foe deserves a ‘‘blast,'' believe me, he will get it. It takes more than a ball score to make baseball news. Suspension for high, low, cunning or rowdy play would be beneficial all around. Beware the dog.
