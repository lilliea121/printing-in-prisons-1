CUBS 10 STOCKING SHED 0

An alleged game of ball was played be-
tween above teams to the tune of
‘‘Please go ‘way and let me sleep.”’
Cubs battered the old Shed down in this
manner: Woody doubled twice. Charlie
singled and doubled. Herb got two hits.
Freddy got two singles and a double;
Butler, Miller and Manager, each got a
hit.. Some neat catches were made.
Third baseman of Shed, fielded fast.
An uninteresting game that spelled leth-
argy and listless. With few exceptions,
everybody seemed, oh, so tired! Lack of
ginger featured the game, and spectators
‘heaved a sigh of relief when game stop-
ped.

Umpire behind plate spoke in whispers,
30 sleepers would not be disturbed. Ye
olde scribe missed a good game between
Bear-cats and Students.

Wake up, boys, wake up!!
