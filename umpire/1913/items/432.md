The Warden requires that all men must remain with their respective Blocks on the grounds assigned to them, for witnessing the ball games. First, third, ninth, tenth and eleventh blocks will see the games played on Ninth block grounds. Eighth block, and seventh and Twelfth Blocks and Galleries will see the games on the Stable grounds. Fourth, fifth and sixth blocks and galleries will see the games played on the Storehouse grounds. This order applies to all men, employed or unemployed, in shops or elsewhere. Any, who may be detected attending ball-games on other, than their own grounds, will from this date, be denied their privileges and detained in their cells for a period of thirty days. July 30 1913.
