EFFERVESCENCES By Jingles Grape juice for Germans! Who ever said Mr. William Jennings Bryan was a German? Poor understanding. Said a manager of a burlesque show, To a bow-legged girl, "you'll have to go You sing and dance as well as you should, But your understanding is far from good. What will the operating table come to when the moral delinquents are brought forth to be sliced?—Just think of the chickens, milk, rolls and other good things that will never fall to our lot. Fish is a brain food; why is it so few of us have—Oh, never mind.
