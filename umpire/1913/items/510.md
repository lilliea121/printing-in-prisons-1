In the game between the Ninth and Stocking Shed, last Monday, little Ducky met with an accident, that was as painful as unusual. While delivering the ball from the pitcher's box, he snapped the bone of his left arm, between the elbow and shoulder, and will of course be out of the game for the balance of the season. Cleveland is gradually overtaking the mighty Athletics, and the struggle between these teams promises to be an event in baseball history.
