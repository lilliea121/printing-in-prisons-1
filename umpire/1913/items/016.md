My Lord And I

By Robert Davis

““I worked for men,”’ my Lord will say
When we meet at the end of the King's Highway,
“I walked with the beggar along the road,
I kissed the bondsman stung by the goad,
I bore my half of the porter's load.
And what did you?” my Lord will say,
““As you traveled along the King’s Highway?”’

‘I made life sweet,’”” my Lord will say
When we meet at the end of the King’s Highway,
““I smoothed the path where the thorns annoy,
I gave the mother back her boy,
- I mended the children’s broken toy,
And what did you?’’ my Lord will say,
““As you traveled along the King’s Highway.”’

““I showed men God,”” my Lord will say,
““As I traveled along the King’s Highway,
I eased the sister’s troubled mind ;
I helped the blighted to be resigned ;
I showed the sky to the souls grown blind,
And what did you?”’ my Lord will say,
When we meet at the end of the King’s Highway.
