STOCKING SHED vs LIBRARY

April 9

The Stocking Shed were again defeated
by the Library on Wednesday, but gave
a better account of themselves than the
game previous. Tommy had the Libra-
 ry helpless for three innings, and with
the score two to one in favor the of Shed,
it looked very promising for Fingers and
Ducky to land a victory. But Ducky is
not very anxious to beat the Library, he
is holding back for the Ninth Block, and
claims he’ll win the first game, if he has
to pitch it himeelf.

Bill, one of the boys who sets type on
the UMPIRE, ‘‘set’’ a bad example to his
team-mates by striking out. :
