CUBS—BAND AGAIN TIED

June 26

The Cubs and Band came together
again  this afternoon ir an effort
to play off the tie game of June 23,
and for five fast and furious innings the
battle waged, with the honors still even,
when the man in the boiler house, blew
‘“time,”” and the score 5—5.

It was a beautiful game throughout.
Tommy and Jore of the Cubs battled
against Ban and Walt of the Band, and
neither battery showed any advantage
over the other. New England umpired
from behind the bat, and John Henry
was on the bases. The former gave the
faus a taste of the real thing in umpir-
ing, and was at all times the master of
the game.

Ban was very wild, and had it not
been for his good support, and Tommy
being almost equally as wild, there
might have been a decisive contest.

After the second inning however,
when the score stood 5—4 in favor of
the Cubs, both men settled down and
neither side scored until in the fifth,
Rodge, who had walked, came rushing
home on an error and tied the score.

The feature of the game was Jogh’s
desperate steal home, executing a pain-
ful slide over the cobbles, to the plate,
his pain disappearing with the knowl-
edge that he was “‘safe.”’

Certainly the Band stock is going up
by leaps and bounds.CUBS—BAND AGAIN TIED
