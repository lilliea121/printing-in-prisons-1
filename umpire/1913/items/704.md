WITH THE POETS HEADS UP Don't kick and whine, Just get in line With the fellows who've got grit and pluck, Don't frown and scowl, Look glum and growl; Stop prating about ill luck. Lift up your head, Don't seem half dead, Stop wearing a wrinkled face; Give smiling hope, Sufficient scope And joys will come apace. Give me the chap. Who, whate'er may hap, Looks up and is cheerful still; Who meets a bunt With a smiling front, And nerve and whim and will. â€”B 5847.
