IVORY SOAP(Not an Advertisement)It is written, "while there's life there's hope" Cleanse yourself with Ivory Soap. To the bath-room, go you quick, Rub yourself both good and sleek. Flow the water to please your taste; Do not rub in any haste. Rubbing hard to make a foam, Think of the day when you'll go home. Tho' the Fates appear unkind, And you've left your hopes behind, Think of others, tho' they're free, No Warden hands them Ivor-e-e. Think of the motto, "Look up and Hope," Then away to the bath—use Ivory Soap. —B 6815
