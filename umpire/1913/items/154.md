NINTH vs

i the Marden and-Hiz' Co:
Workers Take Prominent Parts

An interesting exhibition game, yes,
very interesting, was played by Ninth
and Jingle’s picked team. I'm in a
quandary as to how I can straighten out
this funny muddle. Oh! I have it!
Home runs: Veap; triples: Wade and
Butler. Two-base hits: Jack, ILefty,
Timmie, Slick, Brownie (2), Longie,
Jimmie, Wearden. Singles ILefty (2)
Slick, Yeap (2), Jack, Warden, Flohr,
Jimmie, Jingles. Count ’em.

Timmie pitched for Ninth. and used a
pretty out-curve with telling effect. He
was well supported.

Butler pitched three innings and re-
tired. ‘Then the Warden strode to the

‘mound, to try and turn seeming defeat

into victory. As he wound up to hurl
his famous slow-ball, rumors flew thick

and fast, that he sold the game, long be-

fore it was scheduled. A full report
will be published on its receipt. Weare
sure that the greatest scandal in base
ball will be uncovered. Des Moines Ike
will render his services. Flohr, by his
poor support, will be indicted as an ac-
cessory after the fact. No wonder Gall-
inger clamors for a probe into the base
ball trust. Congress will take the

~ matter up now.

Only a stenographer could have jotted
down the game in detail.

The High-brows would have won, if
they could have added 10 more runs to
the three they earned. Final score 12--
3, favor Ninth. —Rocky.NINTH vs
