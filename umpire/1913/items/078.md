LIBRARY BEAT CUBS

Game to be Protested, Owing to the
Library using Borrowed Pitcher

The game on Monday, between the Lib-
rary and Cubs, will no doubt be protested.
The score was 2 to O, in favor of the
Library; but it seems that the pitcher
used by the Library belongs to the Stock-
ing Shed. The Stocking Shed is in no
condition tolet out a pitcher like Tommy,
and we think the deal should be looked
into, and see if everything is fair and
above board. The Editor has no know-
ledge of the game as played, as we
stated elsewhere in this issue, our cor-
respondents were all at the Ninthâ€”Plas-
terers game.

The Cubs put up a good game from
all accounts, and the Library barely won
out. Of course, the Library did not have
their strongest team in the field, but they
needed it. We hope that the future
games can be so arranged that the details
will be more complete. '
