LIBRARY vs NINTH

respective teams,
form.

June 27
The game between the above teams

was unavoidably delayed until 4.15, but,
at that hour it started with such a vim
that seven innings were played. within
the ensuing three-quarter hours.

Yeap made his first appearance with
the Librarians pitching against his old
team-mates, and beld them down to four
runs. The Ninth was too strong how-
ever, for the Jingle bells and though both
clubs played splendid ball, the Library
only succeeded in bringing one man a-
cross the plate. Score 4—1. Mack, the
professional umpire dispensed exact just-
ice to both teams and his associate,

John Henry looked after the bases.
