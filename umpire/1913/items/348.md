LIBRARIANS BEAT BAND

July 11

The Band and Librarians came togeth-
er to-day for the final game of their ser-
ies, and fought it out for seven full in-
nings resulting in a victory for the Jin-
glers by the score of 4—1.

In the exuberance of his joy, Jingles
fell from the Store-house steps, and
when he recovered himself, it was notic-
ed that he was much taller than prior to
the game.

The Librarians had traded Yeap, for
Ban J. of the Band, and both men re-
presented their respective clubs in the
box, in a manner that showed that the
exchange was to their liking, for they
excelled their previous performances.

The game was well contested through-
out, and up to the seventh inning when
the score stood 2—1 in favor of the Book-
men, was ever doubtful. In the last
inning however, two runs came rushing
in for the Jingles bells and the game
cinched.

Bill a new one, essayed to umpire the
bases, and did fairly well up to the four-
th inning, when he called a Bandman
out at third, who was palpably safe, and
notwithstanding the kicks, refused to
change his decision. Bill says, ‘‘ a um-
pire has to stand for some awful insualts
from players who can’t do as good.””

Maybe the Librarians have struck
their winning gait, and someone will be
able to answer Jingles’ queries in an-
other column. — Bill.LIBRARIANS BEAT BAND
