SHED LOSE AGAIN

July 9
! };Flle Ninth and Shed crossed bats for
the second game of their series to-day,
and fought for eight full innings. 'The
Shed went down to defeat but there is
nothing to reproach them with. Eggié,
the first man to face Ducky, drove the
ball for a two-bagger, and crossed the
plate on Lefty’s sacrifice, later on he had
a home run, and a single, to his credit,
scoring two of the four runs for the
Ninth. Smithy also had a home run, and
a two-bagger, to be added to his average.
Lefty and Cap, each fell off in their bat-
ting. a3 neither had a hit during the
game. John, a new man, excelled for the
Shed, at the third sack, also having a
three-bagger, and a single to his credit.

Ducky, and Longie, both pitched gilt-
edge ball, having seven strike outs a
piece. John Henry officiated behind
the bat, assisted on the bases by Ken.
Score, Ninth 4, Shed 0. — Bill.
