Illustrated Lecture.

Those who were fortunate enough to -
attend the Lecture on Saturday, listened
to a very interesting lecture on Italy.
The subject was handled in a very able
manner, and covered a wide range of
territory; from Genoa in the North to
Naples in the South. The views shown,
gave a true picture of lifein Italy, and
must have been a revelation to those who.

have never traveled in other lands. The
views of Lake Como were especially
good, and the pictures of Mount Vesu-
vious awe inspiring.

We noticed several Italians in the
audience, and by their aetions saw that
they thoroughly enjoyed the familiar
scenes of home life,

We feel sure that every man present
on Saturday, will second our thanks to
the gentlemen who so generously volun-
teered their time to this work, and hope
it will have good results in creating a de-
sire for knowledge of the world in which
welive; for ‘‘Knowledge is power.”’

We hope that in the near future it
may be possible to have larger quarters
for these lectures, so that more may
participate in them: as we feel sure that
their influence cannot be anything but
helpful.
