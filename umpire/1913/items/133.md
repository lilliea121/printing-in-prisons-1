PLASTERERS vs BAND
Plasterers Run Away With Band, as
Poet is a Poor J udge of Players

To slow music the Bear-cats waltzed
che Bandits around the garage ball room,
A very good game was played and the
fifers showed improvement. Smiling
Tony pitched for the winners, and did
well.

Without apparent effort he puzzled op-
posing batters. Both teams hit the ball
hard in spots. Seven runs were the
fruitage of good batting by Bear Cats.
In the first, Dave hit, and went out steal-
ing third. Stump passed, Felix hit, and
Jim sent him across the plate witha
hard rap to the Balkan States for a homer.
In the third, Tony, Felix, Jim, Tim, and
Fatty each hit. It looked as though they
intended to bat the clock around. Jim
and Tim hit again in fifth. In the sixth,
Dave doubled. Bandits score2 runs.
In fourth inning, Dave, catcher, doubled,
and Big Six whaled out a home run that
made the hands on the clock tower
finally move. Harry hit. During the
game = Bioesix o Jaclk and Harry
doubled. Fattyâ€™s great sliding has the
street cleaning department beat a mile.
