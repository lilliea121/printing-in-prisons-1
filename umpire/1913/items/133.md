CONUNDRUMSWhy do pianos bear the noblest characters? Because they are grand, upright and square. What was the first bet ever made? The alphabet. What is that which is brought to table, often cut, but never eaten? A pack of cards. What is that which lives in winter, dies in summer, and grows with its root upward? An icicle. When does a caterpillar improve in morals? When he turns over a new leaf.
