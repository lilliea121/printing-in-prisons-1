WorryIf you realized just what Worry is, you would stop using it in your business. For Worry is the name given by the Devil, to his choicest brand of smelling salts; and the more you get into the habit of using them the more you come to know what Hell is really like. Here's an antidote for worry-Smile, Smile, Smile--Smile!For where Smiles are, Worry-is not. Worry is just plain poison. It is the most treacherous of poisons, for it not only eats into the finest powers of your mind and life, but it spreads and radiates like a contagious disease. Worry . can do no harm in the atmosphere of cheer, great faith, hope-Work.'Work, Work, Work--Work.How useless Worry is-how foolish! Realize but this and you will very soon banish it, and forever abhor it. Can y 0 u think of a single instance where Worryrendered you a service? Well then, get rid of it.Smile, Smile, Smile-Smile!Worry never did and never will bringanything to pass. It never earned a cent and it never helped a human being. But if you keep busy, if you are continually seeking to render some service, you will never have time nor inclination to Worry.Work Work--Work.
