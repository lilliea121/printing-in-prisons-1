PROCRASTINATIONProcrastination is the evil genius of | the human race. There is no earthly excuse for it, but we are all more or less addicted to it. It is the most unnecessary of all human traits, and the most common. It is no respecter of persons. Intellectual giants and mental pigmies arealike prone to procrastinate. It is the deadly and unrelenting enemy of ambition and progress and lowers efficiency. "Any time will do," and "I will attend to it tomorrow,'' etc. are sayings that have damned many a person to eternal mediocrity, though he be a genius. Once the habit of putting things off is fully developed, a man has not one chance in a thousand of ever catching up with himself. He will forever be doing things or forming resolutions today that he should have done yesterday. Stop procrastinating! You see what you must do, therefore ‘‘do it now," and get it out of your way for all time! You will never regret freeing yourself from this habit, if you once succeed. A little grit and backbone is all that one needs. Act so that the word ‘‘procrastination,' insofar as you are concerned, will at once become obsolete. ‘‘Do 17 Now,"' is the slogan of a victor! —Pliny.
