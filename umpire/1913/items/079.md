If the followers of the Band, Stocking
Shed, Library and Cubs, are disappoint-
ed in not seeing an account of the game
of their respective clubs in the UMPIRE,
they will have to bear with us. Our corres-
pondents are very willing to report the
games, providing they can select the
game ; and as a rule, they all select the
best game. 'The Editor has as much in-
fluence with his staff, as the Ninth Block
has with the umpires. â€˜
