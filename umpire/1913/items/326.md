NINTH EAT DUCKLINGS

July 7

Our own Dauntless Ducky, led his
little band of untried heroes out to-day
to meet the gory-handed Ninth phalanx
in mortal combat. One look at that
grim body of veteran warriors was enough
for the Shedites, however, for then their
nerve began to ooze out, and perhaps is
still a oozing.

When the clouds of battle had lifted,
a portion of the Ducklings were still to
be seen; others had fled, but, unfortu-
nately the two umpires, Jack and Happy
survived the onslaught, though at times
their situation was most precarious.
The carnage was dreadful, and the toll a
sad one. Ninth 7 Shed 0.
