WHY PEOPLE SHOULD OWN
AND READ BOOKS

I regard books in my library in much
the same way that a sea captain regards
the charts in his chartroom. It is man-
ifestly impossible for a sea captain to
carry in his head the memory of all the
reefs, rocks, shoals, harbors, points,
lighthouses, beacons and buoys of all the
coasts of all the world; and no sea captain
endeavors to store in his head such
a mass of knowledge. What he doesis
to know his way about the chartroom,
and when he picks up a new coast, he
takes out the proper chart and has im-
mediate access to all information about
that coast  Soit should be with books.
Just as the captain must have a well-
equipped chartroom, so the student and
thinker must have a well-equipped lib-
rary, and must know his way about that
library. I, for one, never can have too
many books; nor can my books cover
too many subjects. I may never read
them all, but they are always there, and
I never know what strange coast I am
going to pick up at any time in sailing
the world of knowledge. â€”J. London
