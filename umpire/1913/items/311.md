A FRIENDLY SORT O'? WAY When a man ain't got a cent, an' he's feelin' kind of blue, An' the clouds hang dark and heavy, won t let the sunshine through. It's a grand thing my brethern, for a fellow just to lay His hand upon your shoulder in a friendly sort 0' way. It makes a man feel curious: It makes the teardrops start, An' you sort o' fee la flutter in the region 0" your heart. You can't look up and meet his eyes: don't know what to say When his hand is on your shoulder in a friendly sort o' way Oh the world's a curious compound with its honey and its gall, With its cares and bitter crosses; but a good world after all. An' a good God must have made it—least ways that's what I say : When a hand rests on your shoulder in a friendly sort o way.  —Selected.
