Stocking Shed vs. LibraryApril 9The Stocking Shed were again defeatedby the Library on Wednesday, but gave a better account of themselves than the game previous. Tommy had the Library helpless for three innings, and with the score two to one in favor the of Shed, it looked very promising for Fingers and Ducky to land a victory. But Ducky is not very anxious to beat the Library, he is holding back for the Ninth Block, and claims he'll win the first game, if he has to pitch it himself.Bill, one of the boys who sets type on the UMPIRE, "set" a bad example to his teammates by striking out.
