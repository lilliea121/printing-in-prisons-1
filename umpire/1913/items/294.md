LIBRARY vs CUBS

June 30
In a very fast played 8 inning game,

well contested, and without the slightest
dissension, the Cubs, after desperate
fighting, won a lucky victory from the
Library, 5—0.

The Book-worms contested every inch
of the journey, and clean up to the last
inning, the game stood 2-0 against them,
and at that stage, it was by no means a
sure thing for the Cubs.

Both teams fielded exceedingly well,
and with the exception of some wild
throwing, which virtually was the cause
of 8 runs being scored, nothing better
could have been expected. Tommy and
Yeap both pitched a good game for their
and were in great
