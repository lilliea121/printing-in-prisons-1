LIBRARY WINS THIRD GAME FROM STOCKING SHED

April 17

After five days of rest and time to plan
how to appear in the lime-light of the
E.S.P. League, the Stocking Shed bowed
for the third straight time to the Library.
Overseer Campbell’s lavender ward were
interested spectaters.

But for errors, the game would have
been much closer contested, as the
pitchers of both sides stood well at
their posts, Yellow having thirteen
strike outs to his credit, followed by
Tommy, who forced eleven of the Libra-
ry to punch the atmosphere. Jimmie,
of the Library, allowed Dud, of the sta-
ble, to fill his place, so that he would not
have too many strike outs to his credit.

a bunt, and scored on the catcher’serror.
