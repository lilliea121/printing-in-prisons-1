CUBS vs BAND

The Cubs captured another game from
the Band, Monday afternoon at the Store
House grounds by a score of 5—2,

Tommy and Betts, and Herman and
Larry, formed the opposing batteries, but
both moundsmen weakened and fell
down in the third inning, allowing nu-
merous passes. Several of these were
costly, and materially detracted from the
interest in the game from the fan’s point
of view. :

The game was featureless, with the ex-
ception of Herb’s work both in the field
and at the bat, while Joe, for the Cubs,
distinguished himself by a clean double-
play in the fourth.

Both teams need a change of diet—

preferably ginger. —Miteh.
