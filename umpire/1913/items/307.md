It is a pleasure to note the high charac-
ter of the work now being done for the E.
S: P. League by Mack, the new umpire,
who but recently registered with us.
He has shown a thorough familiarity
with the many intricacies of the game;
‘unquestionable honesty in his decisions,
and the ability to control the players,
without incurring their ill-will.  He
should be given the consideration that
is his due by everyone interested in the
success of our league.

Managers should act promptly in as-
serting their authority to prevent dis-
putes between any of their players and
the umpire. Upon at least two oceas-
ions last week, there were heated argu-
ments between one of the Cubs and Hap-
py, the umpire.

Admitting the provocation was great,
the player was clearly in the wrong, and

usurping the duty of the manager,
when he started his argument with Hap-
py. The latter has made many errors,
but, they were ‘‘of the head, not the
heart,”’ and his decisions, or in fact, the
decisions of any umpire, if questioned,
should be done o, quietly and without
bitterness. = The least we can do for
these men, in lieu of salary, is to show
respect for the positions they hold.It is a pleasure to note the high charac-
