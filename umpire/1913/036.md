The above ig a sketch of Mr. Joe Morgan, attending to the numerous wants of
the men on the sixth gallery. We do not know whether Mr. Morgan is satisfied
with all the men on the sixth gallery, but we do know that all the men are satis-
fied with Mr. Morgan. He is in no way connected with the banking concern in
New York. However, the late Pierpont Morgan and our Mr. Morgan had one
trait in common-—the collecting of pictures. His private gallery is one of the
largest in this city, thousands of pictures being in the collection, and he is add-
ing to them daily.
