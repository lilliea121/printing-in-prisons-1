NINTH vs CUBS

April 17

After a week of enforced idleness, due
to the rain, the Cubs again faced the
Ninth, and for the third time went down
to defeat. The weather was perfect,
and alarge crowd was in attendance, in-
cluding two entire Blocks. From the
Ninth’s stand-point, the game was nearly
perfect; Jack and Slick, the battery, do-
ing excellent work. The Cubs pitcher
and catcher also performed well, but had
very poor support in the field.

Neither side scored in the first. In
the second, Jack and Lefty scored on
sacrifice hitsby Yeap and Sam. In the
third, Tim hit for two bases, but was out
stealing home. Brownie hit safe, stole
second and third, and came in on Slick’s
sacrifice. The Cubs failed to score,
Marty dying on third, after making a two
base hit. In the fourth, the Ninth made
another tally, Yeap coming home on a
sacrifice hit by Augie.

In the fifth, the Ninth got five runs off
of Kirkie, after two men wereout. And
in the last, scored another run. The
Cubs could get but three or four men to
first during the whole game, due to the
splendid pitching of Jack, and the good
team work behind him.

The umpire’s decision in the fifth, on
Joe going to second, was very Close; he
looked safe. Final Score 10-0.

‘“Will I get over the Fall”’, asked
Lefty, when he picked himself up in
Thursday’s game. ‘‘Yes’’ said Tim, if
you can make the ‘‘Spring.”

NOTICE

At the opening of the season, Wwe
endeavored to have the games conducted
as nearly as possible as those on the out-
side. One of the reforms to be inaugurat-
ed, was the keeping of official averages.
To do this, we had to conform more
closely to the rules in force on the out-
side; that is, we had to account for every
out. Heretofore, the catcher in here
never had to hold the third strike—an
old rule which was in use, when we first
started playing ball, and had no gloves
to catch with. At this stage of the
game, we can see no reason Wwhy the
catcher should not catch the ball, the
same as in any other position. The Libra-
ry team is adhering to the rule, likewise
the Cubs, (they being the only teams
the Ninth have met this season.)

At the opening game on Monday, at
the Ninth Block grounds, we learned
from the Plasterers’ catcher, they would
not recognize the rule, claiming it was
made expressly for and by the Ninth
team. Well, Harry, my boy, you are
right. But you should not have been
alarmed, no one would have accused you
of making any rule, good or bad for base
ball. The only thing you can make, is
a “kick’’. They are few, if any, who
will admit that all of the rules we are
now playing under, were devised by two
or three men, and outside of those two
or three men, the others have done noth-
ing but reap the benefits of their labor.
So Harry, dear, if there are any other

rules that you don’t like, say so, and

they will be dropped. The compositors
in the Printing Room, will tender you a
vote of thanks for cutting out the third
strike rule; for setting tabulated work in
six point type, is just a little bit harder,
than catching a game of ball once or
twice a week.
