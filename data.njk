		The first phase of this project aims to build an index of every article printed in <em>The Umpire</em> and <em>Eastern Echo</em>, with publication metadata, subject tags, and searchable full text. This index builds on earlier work done by the Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site. You may <a href="https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/printing-in-prisons/" target="_blank">view or download the data</a> on the Research Data and Digital Scholarship team’s GitHub site.

		This project’s data also includes archival-quality, high-resolution photographs of the copies of <em>The Umpire</em> and <em>Eastern Echo</em> held at Eastern State Penitentiary Historic Site. These were digitized by the Schoenberg Center for Electronic Text and Image at the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. <em>The Umpire</em> was digitized in March 2020; <em>Eastern Echo</em> was digitized in February 2023. You may <a href="https://github.com/upenndigitalscholarship/printing-in-prisons/" target="_blank">view and download</a> the raw image files on the Research Data and Digital Scholarship team’s GitHub site.
