<p>PERSONAL QUOTES</p>
<p>There are certain things devoid of reason; the
insolubles a forever aching (and each of us ean
make selection). However, if the inverse was true,
a perfection would reign negating any effort for at-
sinment, and this condition worse than the other:
Doctors need the sick, just as penologists need
prisoners.</p>
<p>Anyone who writes, a nobody writer, a prosaic
back, o an established professional, has_beliefs or
ideas that come and go. The pattern isn't fixed, but a
constant flux; yet, the overall pattern is static. That is,
change within the framexwork only, as are the varied
responses to gravity. Its force includes all</p>
<p>Thus, a seeking, an expressing of what it is to the
writer. There are never conclusions—can never be.</p>
<p>The arch enemy is boredom, unseen, but fiercely
palpable. A palling sameness, an infnite circle: The
anodyne is action, but even this becomes entrapped, all
100 soon wearing the mantle of heavy repetition.
This enemy is never defeated, it is pacified, kept
at bay, just as the Arab’s sun is neutralized. It is fol
1o fight it, the sole recourse s in protective measure</p>
<p>Each of us has a mountain to elimb, and to those
who do there is a view, and this view is singular for no
two views are the same. It is this inseparable chasm
that forever separates humanity, bequeathing immu.
table isolation.</p>
<p>Conversely, and sichly so, it is this same chasm
that permits of life’s beatitudes; the mystery of each
other and the seeking of that unknowingness; the gifts
of eachand the giving of; and the unavoidable truth
that no one belongs to another, and the sharing, if
be, decreed freely.</p>
<p>—Joseph Cotter
Fall 1966</p>
<p>FAULTS</p>
<p>When you see and admit a fault you thereby
take a giant step toward its overcoming. You your
self become stronger, more understanding of others,
and better able to cope with whatever crises arise in
your life,</p>
<p>On the other hand, faults ignored, suppressed,
and thus rejected, gain power, like the power of
steam confined in &amp; boiler. Or again, they are like
nettles, apt to be very annoying—unless you can
grasp them firmly.</p>
<p>Itis best not o talk about your faults to others,
unless there is some compelling reason for o doin.
It is best not to magnify your faults. Compared to
your total personality they are small. Be satisied
that every individual has his faults, be they large
or small ones. When you admit to them, only then
can there be understanding of one’s self and others.</p>
<p>—Chas. J. Johnson</p>
<p>CONSCIENCE OF HOPE</p>
<p>In the silenee of night
We often hear
A soul erying
From the dark and drear.
We walk through the mist,
And look all around;
With only to see a stone,
And a fresh made mound.</p>
<p>The person within,
Has realized too late;
And now he must suffer
His terrible fate!
You stop to listen;
And hope to gain
Some knowledge that life
s not all in vain.
He tells you his story;
Tho strange it may be;
But suddenly you realize
This sinner sounds just like me.
Tho-he never sinned
In the sight of many,
‘He not onee sought a seat
On God's right hand.
So think this over;
‘What he neglected to do,
Cause some day this sinner
May turn out to be you.
—Martin H. Nonnemacher</p>
