“Man, T ain't worried about getting out, T know
when that will be. m concerned with staying out.”

Strange words? Not really.

One inmate speaks the words but many more arc
also concerned with this problem. And if is & prob-
lem. The latest figure T have read shows 86% of in
mates released return to prison® Statisties can he
misleading and T want to believe that this one is
But T ean't he sure. Tm worried now! 1 haven't been
released vet, and the odds are 3% to 4 that T will
come back.

Let us look at this a little closer. Bighty-six
mates out of every 100 return to prison and with
erime on the ineréase, the intake of new prisoners
has inereased considerably. If only 14 men out of
100 remain out and the new inmates in tarn become
one of the 86 out of 100, it stands to reason that
prison populations are getting larger and larger. Tt
this continues then we can assume with statistical
logie that one day everyone will be behind the wall
Well, we will have attained something, anyway. We
would be rid of ex-convicts.

To be sure, T have allowed myself to be carried
away; but only to show the fallacy of statisties. Re-
gardless of the percentage of men who return, it is
stll too many. Why is this so? We read numerous
articles in the newspapers and magazines about the
rehabilitation programs being instituted in our pris-
ans. This should solve the problem.

Rehabilitation is an impressive word. It sounds
important. Webster says it means to restore to good

repute; to fit to make one’s livelihood again. How is
one fit to make one’s livelihood again when one had
o Tivelihood to begin with? The majority of men in
prison come from poverty areas, have little ednen
tion and, in most eases, no trade or eraft in order to
n a deeent livelihood by today's standards. Prison
does little to change this. Today, high school classes
offered to all who want them terminating with o
high sehool equivaleney diploma. This is a means o
an end, not an end in itself. The next logieal step.
would seem to be voeational training in one eraft or
another. This is where the rub comes in. Except for
a few of the Correctional Tndustries, the possibilities
of acquiring a skill that would be acceptable by the.
fons outside are extremely rare
Contrary to popular belief, prisons have not
ehanged. New names have been bestowed upon them
array of faney titles for the pesonnel but
prisons are the same a8 they have always been, The
greatest amount of jobs to be had wre prison ori
ented, i, cell block runners, yard eleaners, bross
polishers,” sweepers, moppers, pot_washers, table
wipers and assorted labor work. The few men who
enter prison with any skill are immediately placed
into those spots, leaving little chance for the un.
skilled.
Correetional Industries

not, in itself, the answer.
It could be, but at present it offers little opportunity
for the individual to acquire a skill that, would be on
a competitive level with outside industry. They on.
compass the products that will be used mainly by
‘prisons, state hospitals and various state-operated in
stitutions. The machinery and equipment is usually
antiquated, instruction personnel at & minimum and
‘production'is geared t
at the lowest possible cost.

The Printing Plant at Eastern Correctional Inst
tution is one of the exceptions. Printing is one of the
highest paying industries in the United States and
has only just begun to realize its potential. Our
plant is equipped with contemporary machines and
uses production methods incorporated from outside
industry. Experienced instructors supervise all op-
erations of printing from beginning to end, but more
are needed. Through the efforts of Mr. Veto
Tavecchia, General Supervisor, and Mr. Al French,
Printing Instructor, the local printing trade unions
have been approached with the idea of accepting
qualified men into the union and placing them into
positions of employment upon discharge from the
institution. The unions have reacted favorably to
this and, to date, there are a fow dozen men working
at this crat; linotype operators, compositors, press-
men, and two men who have become department
foremen.

‘The Printing Plant is, by no means, the answer to
a gigantic problem, it s only a small beginning. The
problem, immense though it is, must have o begin:
ning if it is ever to have an end.
