<p>APPOINTMENT CONFIRMED FOR DIRECTOR OF TREATMENT</p>
<p>Tt takes skil to separate fact from fetion in the
fanciful yarns flowing constantly through the inter-
nal grapevine. One of the wildest and most wishful
stories to come through in recent times predicted the
appointment of Mr. Joseph Maher, 7-Gallery *‘head
shrinker’ (as he and his colleagues were referred
to hereabonts) to the position of Director of Treat
ment cons (and this is important to note) before
there was cven a suggestion that the DOT position
was going to become vacant.
When the Direetor of Treatment vacaney actually.
oceured those of us who had picked up the Maher
it when it first appeared on the ‘“wire
simply waited for *‘the day to follow the
night”&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>The man, Joseph Maher, age 32, paychologist,
was offally appointed to the job, Director of Treat-
ment, September 1, 1966, after serving os house”
psyehologist since August 1962 (also the date he
commenced working at SCTPHA)</p>
<p>Education: attended LaSalle College and did
‘undergraduate work in psychology  also did graduste
work and clinical training in paychology at Temple
University; took corollary courses in foreign lan-
guages and methods of teaching same—specializing
in German. Note: Mr. Maher plans to continue
Studies toward a degree in eriminology or corrections.</p>

Philadelphia County, Department of Public Assist-
ance - 14 years; counselor and administrator of clinics

<p>Concert
Band
Commended</p>
<p>1t has seldom been the pleasure of the reviewer
to_experience as enjoyable @ program s the one
offered by the institution band on November 15, 1966,</p>
<p>This ensemble under the able direction of its
leader, Robert Barelay, Music Dircetor, produced, in
this writer’s opinion, 4 tonal quality and beauty of
sound not often heard at a concert in an institution
setting.</p>
<p>To begin with, the band performed as o unit.
There were o noticeably missed cucs; the various
sections came in precisely; and the coda executed as
required. Whatever flaws appeared, can be attributed
mare to imperfect acousties and ampliication th
faulty playing or poor musicianship,</p>
<p>Probably more ontstanding than the instrum
and voeal versutilty displayed was the range and un.
wsualness of the program itself. Mr. Barelay dared
to tackle musical works more adaptable for symphonic
groups and carried them suceessfully. The writer
must admit that he was apprehensive because of th</p>
<p>nature of the program selections and the limitations
imposed by the available instrumentation, but his
fears soon proved to be unfounded once the bund
emonstrated its sure-fire proficiency.</p>
<p>The concert was a stunning success and proved</p>
<p>once again that spirit, determination, and skill</p>
<p>overcome a dearth of instruments and personnel
