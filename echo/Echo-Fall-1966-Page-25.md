THINK YOU HAVE TROUBLES?

PEOPLE ALL OVER COMPLAIN OF THE ODDEST THINGS

A Pasadena, California, woman complained to the
police that someone was breaking into her home every
sight...and leaving money in her pursc!

Brownsville, Texas, lawnen heard the story of
sine-year-old boy who was beset and pummeled by a
group of angry little gi

In New Britain, Conne
someone was picking up his small foriegn car from its
parking place in front of his house, and putting it in
the middle of the road!

Even stranger conplaints have resounded in the
cars of law enforcement officials throughout the world.

In Hanau, Germany, it was alleged that a hotel man-
ager was turning bedbugs loose in a competitor's hotel.
A farmer in Lodi, Ttaly, complained that someone had

pped into his pasture and snipped the taila off his
39 cows. A London women said that her landlord, who
wanted her to move, had seen her wash drying on the
line and had sprinkled her undies with itching powder!

Lawnen, of course, aren’t the only people who hear
odd complaints in the line of daty. Doctors do, too.
Valentin Medina, a 61-year-dd Spanish farmhand, pre-
sented himself in 1960 at a Madrid hospital with the
claim that he never slept. A hometown doctor affirmed
that he had never known Medina to catch a wink of
sleep in 50 years!

Commonest health complaint? It scemsto be atoss-
up between the common cold and the headaches the per-
son who has totally escaped either one is a medical
rarity. The average American gets thece colds  year,
and an estimated 85% of Americans suffer from head-
aches.

the world’s most widely-used medication. Americ
alone take about 16 billion aspirin tablets a year; rec-
eatly, The Bayer Company produced its 100 billionth
aspirin tablet. Small wonderit's been said that the two
things which answer more complaints -than anything
in the world are the police department and the

in tablet!
But even aspirin probably would not have cured the
“headache”” of the young couple who returmed to their

Foll 1966

that someone had entered the house in their
and mixed about 30 gallons of chery-flavored gelatin
in the bathtub

On the other hand, a Tokyo man might have done
well to gulp a couple of aspirin tablets before he de-
cided that an inefficient telephone operator gave him
o pain...and showed his annoyance by setting fire to
the phone booth!

Short tempers have spureed other bizarre complaiats,
In Cleveland, Ohio, a complaint was filed against &
painter who grabbed a women and painted both her
ams greea. Seems she'd been bothering him with re-
peated criticiams of the way he was painting her garage.

The all-time bad sportmanship record is probably.
held by the giel in Schongau, Germany, who attended
her fomer beaw’s wedding...and demonateated her di
pleasure by knocking him down during the ceremony!

ght fingered citizens come in for their share of
crazy charges. In Tuscon, Arizona, somebody broke
intoa chicken coop twice inone week, each tine steal-
ing a hen and replacing it with a rooster!

But that was nothing compared with the exploit of
the unknown thief who filched a 2" x 18" strip of as-
phalt from a Dunstable, Massachusetts, street...or
the burglar in Santiago, Chile, who entered @ man's
house while he slept, ifted him gently off the bed and
put him on the floor without awakening him...then made
off with the bed!

Less oblivious t it all was the Davenport, lowa,
woman who complained that a tecnager had ridden @
bicyele over her back while she lay sunbathing in the
park.

Some people won't give a man a sporting chance:
a complaint filed in Columbus, Ohio, stated that six
men were ganbling in the waiting room of the unemploy-
ment office.
