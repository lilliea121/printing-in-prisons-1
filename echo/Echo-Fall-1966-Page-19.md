Twenty times winner of the annual National Qual-
ity Award, presented to insurance underwriters for
excellence, Mr. Colborn is also & member of the Penn
Athletic Club,

Colborn_enjoys visiting and_corresponding with
his many friends residing behind these gray and
brown stone walls; “stone cottage,” as he used to tell
one of his friends who served time here (Colborn
used to refer to him as “the banker”), for whom he

He said that his objectives were helping men who
made a tragic mistake, to start a new Tife. “I must,
however, be very discriminating due to some bitter
disappointments,” he said.

As far back as he can reeall, he has had compas-
sion and commiseration for human beings who have
been incarcerated for long periods of time. He said
that a great many of these men deserved being given
long terms of imprisonment; but, he believes that
others, due to the infuriated indignation of the sen-
tencing judge, have received sentences far and be-
yond the period justified for the crime o crimes for
which they may have been found guilty.

Mr. Colborn became aetively interested in lending
a helping hand to prisoners as the result of an of-
fense committed by the son of a very good friend.
“This man was never too stable,” Mr. Colborn said.
“When he was a young man he belonged to the vol.
untary fire department in my community, and was
always thrilled when a fire took place. Apparently
... there were ot enough fires occurring, so he, to-
gether with two of his cronies, were luter found
guilty of arson. He was given a frightfully long sen-
tence.” But, Mr. Colborn explained that although
he was deserving of paying a stiff price to socicty
for the kind of eriminal behavior he exhibited, the
long sentence was a classic example of virtually un-
controlled anger on the part of the judge, who meted
out an unreasonably long sentence of thirty to sixty
ears in prison.

He eontinued, “FHad he served out the entire sen-
tence, he would have been an elderly man when re-
leased. T felt sorry for him after he had served a
number of years and decided to pay him a visit in
prison. Al of his so-called friends had long sinee
lost interest in him. The only ones, other than T, who
ever visited him, were his relatives. One day T asked
the young man if there were men at his place of con-
finement whom he knew never received a letter from
anyone— and who never reccived any visitors even
at Christmas time, He assured me there were many
in that category.” This recalled to my mind the
time when [ was in the Army, during World War 1,
when I would eagerly await mail call in the hopes of
hearing from my loved ones, or anyone, When two
or three days would elapse without any word from
home, T was a bit despondent.”

AMr. Colborn continued. “These thoughts prompted
me to call the warden of the Eastern State Corree-
tional Tnstitution to volunteer corresponding with

those whom he knew were complotely friendless;
that is, men who never received any kind of mail and
who never received visitors. It was my original in-
tention to correspond with these men to make them
feel that there was at least one person who was in-
terested in their welfare. 1 was furnished with ten
names, To each one T wrote the same letter volun-
teering to correspond with him—and I stated that
there were others in the institution who were receiy-
ing the self-same letter. T thought perhaps two or
possibly three would acknowledge and weleome my-
friendship. T assumed that the others would think
it was some kind of a trick; but to my surprise,
eight of these men replied with heart-felt expressions.
of gratefulness. T had thought of only corresponding
with these men. But, like “Little Topsy” it grew.
Each one implored me to visit with him. Bach one
told me his tale of woe.”

Following this start, Mr. Colborn began an active
interest in assisting prisoners to seeure parole plans
—home, job and sponsor—required by the Board of
Parole prior to an inmate’s conditional release from
prison. He has offered help to all kinds of offenders:
murderers, burglars, and _robbers; however, he
chooses carefully any nareotics offenders, sex offend-
ers. or forgers, because of the psychologieal dynam-
ies involved in their committing such offenses.

Mr. Colborn has frequently appeared personally,
in behalf of inmates before the Pennsylvania Board
of Pardons, seeking clemency for his friends in
prison. He has, more than once, taken time out from

breakis at the seashore to return to Penn.
sylyania when the Pardon Board is to consider one
of “his eases” to enter a strong plen. As the result
of his deeds he has come to know each member of
the Board quite well. The Board knows he does not
earn any money from his representation of inmates;
in fact, he frequently loans or gives fands to men to
help them get restarted in society. His trips to
various parts of the state, on behalf of inmates, are
personally financed.

Over the years, he has been disappointed by a few
of his “prison friends.” But the large majority have
continued to maintain law-abiding conduct and
records as members of free saciety.

He visits the institution_regularly—mostly on
holidays and weekends during his otherwise frec
time—to counsel his friends. But, mostly, he wants
10 be their real friends; to instill confidence: to offer
hope and to manifest a genuine example of human
concern and human love for fellow men less fortu.
nate than himself.

Currently, Mr. Colborn is acting as parole advisor
(sponsor) for eighteon parolees. He has sponsored

es that number. Tn addition, he is presently
iting and corresponding with approximately 20
inmates at this institution. and quite a number eon-
fined in other state correctional institutions,

‘Truly, it can be said this man is performing a vital
human serviee not only to conviets and former
victs, but to society in general. How can his serviee
really be adequately measured?
