History of

The Fastern Feho

By Tommy Williams

The Penal Press is the offcial voice of men American prisons. Its origin is dubious and spec lative at best. Any notoricty has been of a dualistic nature ranging from verbal acelaim to voeiferous condemnation. Yet, the Penal Press has survived, mainly because many persons realized the benefits of a constructive outlet through writing. The writ ings have been varied, but the slant has always bee directed at. prisons, and_ people in prison. This is ot to say that this central theme has been the totality of the inmate’s thought. Prison being the dominating Sactor in the expression of thoughts through writing, can be justified, considering the closed environmer in which prisoner’s live. The writings of the Penal Press have run the gamut in format; from the one page sheets to the forty page slick eover magazines of many of our larger prisons.

The Eastern Echo is the magazine printed here at the State Correctional Institutional at Philadelph It had its beginning ten years ago us o fledgling 20 page affair. Iis inception can be attributed to the ideas and official sanction of many. Ticluded was Mr. Frank G. Martin (Warden at that time - now deceased) and the offcial treatment staff. However the plans, groundwork and first edition ean be cred- ited to one man, Jerry Culp, the maguzine's first editor. His goals regarding the Eastern Echo could not be et in motion by himself as he was due to be released from prison soon after the “Echo’s’” first publication date. Knowing this, he wrote his first and last editorial as a sort of credo, which successive editors have vainly sought to follow. T think it is appropriate that a few paragraphs of this editorial be quoted to illustrate the central meaning of this ‘man’s idea.

“Dear Reader:

the first issue of the Bastern Echo. e is the newest entry into the penal 1Tt will be the policy of the editors

press field. to present articles, poems, and stories which ex-

press the thoughts and feeli fined at this institation.

““The Eastern Echo is your magazine. Tt will be only as good as you want it to be.

““The Eastern Echo is intended to be the vaice of the men in here, How powerfl a voice depends upon the quality and quantity of the ‘material submitted.

““Many of us have long looked forward fo & publication for this institution. Sinee T will e here for only this issue T would like to advance my hope that the Eastern Echo will continue to grow and take its place among the top members of the Penal Press fild. Keep this magazine as the voice of all the men in here and not of just one group, Remember that the articles and Storics published by the Eastorn Echo will be read by many citizens of this and other states. Poor material will reflect on all. Good material will bring favorable responses and undoubted benefts. Make the Eastern Echo broad and pro- gressive in its outlook.

ngs of the men con-

““Guard this tiny new flame of yours against

the glory secker and the irresponsible. A new freedom has been handed to you by those in authority. They will wait to see how you aceept

the responsibiity.””

This editorial speaks for itself. Tt lays down the broad guidelines of Echo policy which subsequent edifors have felt obligated to follow. The words are of another decade but time has not erased the value of them.

Twelve editors have reigned over the magasine since its auspicious beginning. They are here listed in chronological order

Eastern Echo

Each editor pervaded the magazine with his own special personality. To speak in terms of this nataral trait a5 contributing to the snecess of the magazine would be a prevarication. The majority of Eeho Editors assumed_their literary position untrained, and painfully groped their way through many dif: fieult situntions. It has been said that *The writer a5 well as the orator employs for the accomplishment of his purposes, the instrumentality of words. It is in words that he clothes his thoughts. It is by means of words that he depiets his feelings. Tt is, therefore, essential to his success that he be provided with copious vocabulary and that he possess an entire command of all the resources and appliances of his language.”

These words will be recognized by many of our readers, for they embody a principal that s neces. sary but not often possible

In spite of the temporary drawbacks T have mentioned, the Eastern Echo can well be proud of its Titerary_achievements. Tn 1960 Mrs. ‘Dorothy Seheer, long a champion of the rehabilitation of men and women in prison, lauded the Eastern Echo 18 one of the finest in the entire national Penal Prots” Other words of commendation have come from such persons as Dr. Negley K. Teters, Professor of Soci. clogy; Morris Gerber, Esq, (formerly # judge in Montgomery County); Jumes W. Percy, " (former asistant. o Mayor of ‘Lancaster); Erle Stanley Gardner, Writer, and many others. Echo has recoived similar commendations from various agencies and boards like the Pennsylvania Prison Society, the Halt. way Houses and others, (My apologies to those indi- viduals T have not mentioned by name, for they have been the unstng heroes of our cause.) Without the encouragement of these people during the Fastern Echo's ten_year_ existence, the magazine could not have been possible.

For a few years the Eastern Echo basked in the 1959.60-61 tributes that had been heaped upon its literary head. Soon thereafter it went into decline after being condemned by a few persons who rose o the prison thrones of offcialdom estranged from and antagonistic to modern concepts of penology. Their inimical precepts took the form of extreme restric- tions on_ material nccepted for_publication. ' Thus, they inhibited writing skills previously displayed and retarded the latent skills of the would-be writr.

Subject material of the Eastern Echo during its decade of publication has been diverse, with many shades of literary differences. Some of the subjects delved in included Parole and Commutation, Juvenle Delinquency, Psychology and Psychiatry in Prisons, Worldvide Penal Treatment, Prison Reform, Modern Penlogy, Criminal Law, Prison Labor, and. others too mumerous fo name.
