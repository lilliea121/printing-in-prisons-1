<p>There Jsn't too much to this story except it might be amusing to o few of you. But it bugged me so nueh, T almost lost my marbles ... the rest of t</p>
<p>T'm o con... you know, a jailbird. And it all hap. pened one day at mail call ... the bug, T mean.</p>
<p>We just got back to the eell block, affer a serump. tuous supper af Spanish Rice and Kidney Beans. 1 2 on my bunk in my cell, rolling a smoke,</p>
<p>id’ style, when T heard my name hollered for mail call. 1 leaped up and ran for the cell door But then T siowed down so I wouldn't look too anx. fous. We cons have a little pride too, you know.</p>
<p>T gingerly took my letter from the block hack with an exaggerated display of casualness, and retraced ny steps back to the sanctity of my ccll, with gusto. T slowly turned the envelope over in my hand, play- ing my usual little game where I try to guess which eratic, shapely starlet had written me this time. But, as usual, it was my monthly letter from mom; bulky in volume, and written in her strong, heavy slavic hiand. T aiways know the letter is going to be from mom, but I play the little game of the Juscious broad, anyway. Why shouldu’t 11 A guy's supposed 1o have some pleasures out of life, ain't he?</p>
<p>In my mind I was asserting my right to day dream abont the statisties “38-23-38&quot; as 1 savagely pulled the letter out of the envelope and unfolded the huge page. T don't know where in the hell mom gets her letter paper, but when I get through spreading it out, it damn near covers my whole bunk, It takes me almost as long to get it ready as it does to read it. Anyway, here's what she sez</p>
<p>Eastern Echo</p>
<p>“My dear son, Francis Xavier,”</p>
<p>Mom named me after Franeis X. Bushman, canse she told me onee she had a erush on him when she was a little girl. But everyone ealls me Zave.</p>
<p>That's short for Xavier. She sez...</p>
<p>time than last time. Hows that! OK., 1 hope. How are yout Fine I hope. We are all fine_and hope you are the same. Are you OX. T hope so. Youre papa is out of work again since the last time I wrote to You, twice already. The first job was a night watchman job in a whiskey ware. house yet. 4 days he's there and he gets roaring drunk and trips over all the alarm strings they lay out to catch the erooks. No offence to you, my dear son, Francis X</p>
<p>Well, anyway, he_got canned and_con home with a shopping bag full of stuff from the warchouse he was putting away for rainy day. 1 took outta the bg 7 bottles of whiskey, 3 haft gallons of musketell, 2 bot. tles of Rock and Rye, 1 lttle bottle of bit. tors, but it tasted lousy, and 15 bottles of choeklet covered crickets. T sez o papa, how come 15 bottles of chacklet covered erickets?” and he se, Deause it’s for gore- mays, that’s why. Well, T ate a hole jar all by myself and they dont even taste like erickets. Do they have crickets where youre at? The sekond job papa had since T wrote you lnst was at that big restrant down fown, the CHICKEN GALORE. And he was a chicken plucker beause they only cooked fresh chickens. One hole weck pupa does good and makes $53.67 and then one day papa wraps one of the hafl gallon jugs of musketell in his coat and fakes it in the ehicken plucking room with him. When the boss comes for the plucked chickens Iater on, they ain't plucked, and papa's out cold</p>
<p>Foll 1966</p>
<p>and the empty wine jug is layen on the pile of chickens. He ot fired. To he's going frog sticking with Mr. Kaloostian for 6746 a frog, so hold your breth and say jure beads. Youre little sister Pauline is 16 mow and she was in the 9th grade. the only one of you kids who got to hig} school, bt she was ex-spelled last week. Y Seen how big Pauline was when she came in with me to visit you at Baster. She's like a woman and oi, those big logs. Well, she comes home with one of those min skirts one day; $15.00 it cost, but where she got the money, who nose. Theyre so short, those skifts. They go all the way up and Pauline’s got those big lgs. And she wears it to school last week, and T sex.... ‘don’t wear it to the 9th grade, Pauline. s too short and your legs are like a woman's. She se, ‘it’s my skirt, ma, and T wearing ? So'what happens? Don't that snotty nglish Teecher, Mr. Wortter holler about the skirt and slap Pauline’s bare leg. And don't Pauline jump up and flatten him with one punch, She's strong, that Pauline. What a riot! They had to come and get me at the factory, and Mr. Sauerwein, my boss, wis mad. He docked me o haff days pay, the schniiel. Pauline eant go back to sehol, so 1 gess Tl have to get her a job at the s tory. T hope she don't punch Mr. Sauerwein if he pinches her legs. O, Francis Xavier, what &amp; lot of troubles we got out here. You should be glad youre in o place where they ain't got no troubles. Yon remember you ast me to tell yaure old sweetheart, Olga, to get in touch with you. Well, she's living Bernie Morostrowski now and don't wanna o it cause Bernic's got an awful temper and hits hard. She sez for you to give her o brake and don't make Bernic But T was telling Mrs. Borazinski a-</p>
<p>ou know her, the lady up the comer with the anchor fattoed on her arm and the big Goiter on her neck. Well, she said her dsughter, Stella, wood be happy 10 write to you. You remember Stella Bora.- sinsl, the fast kid, but she’s a looker. You gotta ‘adnit that. Stellas got 3 kids now she never was married. But you cant hold 0ld that against her cause she's a looker, nd you gotta admit that, So I st her, telia, wood you like to write to my son, ‘rancis Xavier, at the Pen?’ and she sez, “Wood T4 Youre damn right T wood!” She. gave me this pitcher of her in a Bikini to Send 10 you and It you like it you and her can get fogether when yon get out .</p>
<p>T let o of mom’s big letter and started to hunt for Stella in the Bikini. I'm thrashing all over the cell looking for Stella and T keep bumping into Mom’s letger. Tt damn near fls the room, like a parachute. I don't see Stella anywhere, and the envelope is empty. Tm starting to panic now, and T gathers up</p>
<p>2</p>

<p>He sez, “Take it easy, Bilkowskivie,” and T can see the knuckles on his hand whiten s he grips the edge of the desk. He's thinking I'm snapping out bt he don't wanna blow the whistle unless he's sure. T don't give him the chance to make sure, beeause 1 run off the block to the Captain's Office and bump into Lootenant Krisp, just outside the door.</p>
<p>He grabs my arm and sez, “Take it casy, Bilkow- skovie, Where's the fire?”</p>
<p>T said, “Stella’s missing! I want to see Captain Albright.”</p>
<p>He said, “Who's Stella, and what's that?” Point. ing to mon's floppy letter.</p>

<p>Just then Major Brandt walks up and sez, “What's going on here, and what’s that thing?”</p>
<p>T explained about Stellw’s picture aid everything and he sez, “Ts that a letter, no kidding?” Then he said, “We'll have to take it up with the mail room to- morrow.</p>
<p>“T want Stella now,” I wailed. “ waited 435 years for Stella and T want her now</p>
<p>“Look Zave,” he said. He used my first name but he didu't sound to friendly. “You knoek this erap off and go back to your block.”</p>
<p>1 started back to the block and then shot off the main corridor towards the mail roor Tbumped into a working buddy from the brick ga He grabbed my arm and said, “Hey, where ya go’ Zave?. It's check time already.”</p>
<p>1 said, “Leggo, I gotta find Stella!”</p>

<p>2</p>
<p>So much love to you from your dearly be- loved mother. Yours truly, Mom</p>
<p>1 1nid mom’s letter down with mixed emotions and started to roll another ‘Billy the Kid’ when the thin cigarette paper slipped out of my hand and fluttered under my bunk. I got down on all fours and hunted for it. The light was dim and 'm groping for it way underneath, when my fingers bumped into a piece of hard, curved paper. My hand trembled as T straight ened up and turned the paper over. It was Stella! Holy Toledo!</p>
<p>She leaped out at me from the glossy print, and her voluptuousness surrounded me with &amp; warm fecl- ing. 1 had found the picture that wasn’t even lost. Gad, those Bikinis are something! Or nothing, v} ever way you look at them. And mom was</p>
<p>ight, Stella s Tooker, that's for sure. And wha » shape Wow!</p>
<p>1 called the block hack over and said, “T found</p>
<p>Stella under the bed and Im sorry I popped off at Ya. Do you want to see her?”</p>
<p>e gives me this funny look and sez, “That's O, Bilkowskovie. I didn't write you up yet, anyhow. Then he takes the picture and looks at it and his Adam's apple jumps up and down. “Wow!” he eroaks, “She sure is some looker, ain't she?”</p>
<p>‘That night T stay in my cell and wrote a letter to mom instead of going to the movie. Who wants to see a crummy movie with Stella around. T said ...</p>
<p>Dear Mom,</p>
<p>1 received your letter and the pieture of Stella, and you're right, mom. She sure s a looker. You be sure and tell her right away T'm glad she wants to write to me, and 1 think she sure is a looker. Tell her T don’t care about the 3 kids. None of us i perfect, you know. You be sure and tell her that,</p>
<p>Mom, you gotta straten papa out. He had 13 jobs last year and 9 jobs already this year. You tell him I said, “Straten up, papa, or Tl whack your tail a good one when I get out.” And tell Pauline I said to put on a long skirt and go back to school, and to stop sucker punching the teachers, or she'll end up a bum. There's enough bums in the family already. You tell her 1 said 5o, or LIl whack her tail &amp; good one when T get out. T don't want her in the fact- ory with that Sauerwein, either. Do you hear? T know a few things about Moe, and it ain't all just pinching legs, cither.</p>
<p>Well, mom there ain't too much to write about in this place, so Tl elose this letter by telling you to tell Stella what T told you to tell her. She sure is a looker, mom. 1 grant you that, alright. Your loving son, Francis Xavier Bilkowskovie</p>
<p>PS. No, mom. They don't have no chawk-</p>
