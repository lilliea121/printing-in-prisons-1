<p>ANGELS</p>
<p>The ANGELS, a Lomax and Welty production,</p>
<p>mediate rave notices from all of BS.P. fan. not n few of whom are most eritieal in regard to upstart new football feams.</p>
<p>Losing 2 successive exhibition games made for some momentary pessimistic speculation, but when the offcial league play began the Angels grabbed first place by winning 2, and tying 2 in their first four starts (AIl of which gocs io show a poor exhibition or two does ot a season make). Tn their last 4 games they won 1, lost 2, and tied for a final record of 3 wins, 2 losses, 3 séoreless ties</p>
<p>Comprising the heaviest_(average) line in_the Ieague this vear were Ronald *Big Boy”” Lomax, 210; John **E] Snako”” Welty, 230; Dave Haan, 220; Con- way, 200; Stanley Moroz, 190. Les Karver and Otis Halloway were offensive ends. *“Hillbilly”” was the all important center. Calling the signals at quarter- back was Harry **Roll.out” Zietz, who had “‘a very ood year.&quot;” Handling the fullback chores was Henry *‘Big Hank&quot;” Buckery who likes to run the ball; left- half ‘was Marvin Thompson, picture runner; Mr. Blocking Back’&quot; S. Cantoral provided his usual co sistent brand of play, and McMillan and *Goodie! Goodman rounded out the backfield. Alfred Sheppard, Steve, Joe Massanova, James Banks, ““Dutch’” Bagely, ““Red”” Smith and William **Pencil Willie'” Thornton all specialized on defense and did a very commendable Job.</p>
<p>Coach Billy Cantoral “spotting,” shuttling play-</p>
<p>ers in and out of the line-up, and shouting words of</p>
<p>encouragement to the men on the field, handled</p>
<p>diffcult assignment like he’d been aronnd the game awhile.” (He has, and that's a fact)</p>
<p>““Pencil Willie’” sustained an aggravating knee injury early in the season and was ont the remainder of the year. The Angels sorely missed his stellar de. fensive line play.</p>
