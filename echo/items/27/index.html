<p>s0 here I am</p>
<p>Jerry Haas has gone where the grass is truly greener. Echo, being a prison creature, remains with us. What to do with this featureless monster? make wallander editor. That’s it!</p>
<p>That's it, huh</p>
<p>During the five years that T have been reading Echo—with only a few exceptions—this publication has displayed a remarkable agility for avoiding issues vital to all of us. Well now, I am not so agile. Nor is my inelination as editor such as to allow me at any time to embrace the specious reasoning which causes its adherents o always duck, but never oh never toss @ punch,</p>
<p>There will be some changes made. T have concocted a simple Echo formula designed to justify for all minds these chariges: The Eastern Echo is a journal primarily ezpressing inmate views, beliofs, opinions and convictions authored by inmates in articles on any and. all topics germane to his life as prisomer or free man.</p>
<p>Although the Echo “writing staf?” (Tommy Williams, Lou MeCloud, Terry Baulkman, Norsian Pearson and Frank Rouse) are eager to be heard, all of us are of one mind in that articles written by inmates, not with staff affli- tion, should appear in print more often than has been happening. Indeed, we are most willing for your articles to shove us right off the pages!</p>
<p>For this fo oceur it is of course necessary that you submit material for publication. But first, it is essential that the author be discreet in selecting the Vocabulary to best express his thought. And last, to keep reasonably clear of the author’s bugaboo—rewrite, I recommend to you this guideline (One which 1 shall have in mind as T edit your work ) : It frequently happens that having one’s name after an article denoting authorship is not an adequate reminder for the reader that he is reading an opinion, belict, ete., of the author, The reader may become confused and think he is reading something that is factusl, when what he is doing is reading opinion no matter how learned. So let us keep our readers aware of what they are reading. It is casily accomplished just by inserting (where proper) expressions such as: *‘In my opinion—,&quot;or ““As T sce it—,&quot;&quot; and “It seems to me—&quot;&quot;; these and other such identifying terms serve to keep things nicely organized in our minds. Then oo, when using o quote, make sure the reader knows that someone is being quoted and who that someone is. Make every effort to note within your article, media from which quoted material has been extracted.</p>
<p>This brings us to the changes or innovations which will be initiated in the</p>
<p>upcoming Eastern Echo. May I remind all of you, as you read the following, of the Echo formula as stated above.</p>
