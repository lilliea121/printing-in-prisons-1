Concert
Band
Commended

1t has seldom been the pleasure of the reviewer
to_experience as enjoyable @ program s the one
offered by the institution band on November 15, 1966,

This ensemble under the able direction of its
leader, Robert Barelay, Music Dircetor, produced, in
this writer’s opinion, 4 tonal quality and beauty of
sound not often heard at a concert in an institution
setting.

To begin with, the band performed as o unit.
There were o noticeably missed cucs; the various
sections came in precisely; and the coda executed as
required. Whatever flaws appeared, can be attributed
mare to imperfect acousties and ampliication th
faulty playing or poor musicianship,

Probably more ontstanding than the instrum
and voeal versutilty displayed was the range and un.
wsualness of the program itself. Mr. Barelay dared
to tackle musical works more adaptable for symphonic
groups and carried them suceessfully. The writer
must admit that he was apprehensive because of th

nature of the program selections and the limitations
imposed by the available instrumentation, but his
fears soon proved to be unfounded once the bund
emonstrated its sure-fire proficiency.

The concert was a stunning success and proved

once again that spirit, determination, and skill

overcome a dearth of instruments and personnel
