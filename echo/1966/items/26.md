“MIDGET” FOOTBALL As we tended to the myriad of last minute detai just prior to going to press, it was brought to my ttention that football is stll ““big” on the ESP. idiron scene. So, venturing forth this past week. end to satisfy both my curiosity and a request for Echo publicity, T encountered a titanie struggle of lilliputians. Two teams of lightweights, mosquito- weights, ete, like really small, having a *ball” ‘Wirren *'Biggie’” Zachary coaches and quarter- backs one team, and William *'Red”” Smith the other. Weather pernitting they wil be hokding forth cach Sunday wm. for the next three woeks and hope to see your face among the sideline crowd.
