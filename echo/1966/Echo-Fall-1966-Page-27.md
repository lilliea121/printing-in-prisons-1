player who advanced through the
ranks for a place in the top ten.
Twice he has finished second in
the Club_Championship Tourna
ments and was o member of the
Championship Industrial League
Teams of 1964 and 1965.

Championship Team has brought
Antoniewiez up_against. some of
the top players in this area, and
although he has not had a great
deal of sucecss against them, due
to their greater theoretical knowl-
edge, his performance has been
commendable.

Herbert Mitehell is_constantly
in and out of the ranks of the
top ten. He loves to play chess,
providing it moves at a brisk
pace. This passion for fast mov-
ing has cost him many a game
that should have been in the vic-
tory column. He has always been
a frifle above our average player
but he refuses to exert himself
t0 attain a higher rating.

Sinee joining the club he has
competed in two Champio
Tournaments, finishing ninth and
tenth respectively.
