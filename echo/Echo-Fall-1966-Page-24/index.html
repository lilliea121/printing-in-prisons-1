<p>1 1nid mom’s letter down with mixed emotions and
started to roll another ‘Billy the Kid’ when the thin
cigarette paper slipped out of my hand and fluttered
under my bunk. I got down on all fours and hunted
for it. The light was dim and 'm groping for it way
underneath, when my fingers bumped into a piece of
hard, curved paper. My hand trembled as T straight
ened up and turned the paper over. It was Stella!
Holy Toledo!</p>
<p>She leaped out at me from the glossy print, and
her voluptuousness surrounded me with &amp; warm fecl-
ing. 1 had found the picture that wasn’t even lost.
Gad, those Bikinis are something! Or nothing, v}
ever way you look at them. And mom was</p>
<p>ight,
Stella s Tooker, that's for sure. And wha » shape
Wow!</p>
<p>1 called the block hack over and said, “T found</p>
<p>Stella under the bed and Im sorry I popped off at
Ya. Do you want to see her?”</p>
<p>e gives me this funny look and sez, “That's O,
Bilkowskovie. I didn't write you up yet, anyhow.
Then he takes the picture and looks at it and his
Adam's apple jumps up and down. “Wow!” he
eroaks, “She sure is some looker, ain't she?”</p>
<p>‘That night T stay in my cell and wrote a letter to
mom instead of going to the movie. Who wants to
see a crummy movie with Stella around. T said ...</p>
<p>Dear Mom,</p>
<p>1 received your letter and the pieture of
Stella, and you're right, mom. She sure s a
looker. You be sure and tell her right away
T'm glad she wants to write to me, and 1
think she sure is a looker. Tell her T don’t
care about the 3 kids. None of us i perfect,
you know. You be sure and tell her that,</p>
<p>Mom, you gotta straten papa out. He had
13 jobs last year and 9 jobs already this
year. You tell him I said, “Straten up,
papa, or Tl whack your tail a good one
when I get out.” And tell Pauline I said to
put on a long skirt and go back to school,
and to stop sucker punching the teachers,
or she'll end up a bum. There's enough
bums in the family already. You tell her 1
said 5o, or LIl whack her tail &amp; good one
when T get out. T don't want her in the fact-
ory with that Sauerwein, either. Do you
hear? T know a few things about Moe, and
it ain't all just pinching legs, cither.</p>
<p>Well, mom there ain't too much to write
about in this place, so Tl elose this letter
by telling you to tell Stella what T told you
to tell her. She sure is a looker, mom. 1
grant you that, alright.
Your loving son,
Francis Xavier Bilkowskovie</p>
<p>PS. No, mom. They don't have no chawk-</p>
