<p>HISTORY OF THE EASTERN ECHO CONT'D
Eeho magasine like many of its prison counter-
similar to many</p>
<p>of society’s periodicals. It has been published on a
quarterly basis since its first publication date of
Mareh, 1956, Considering that a great number of the
tes run bi-monthly, and monthly</p>
<p>(12 issues u year), it seems strange that this institu-
tion only prints its magasine four times a year. Echo’s
publication_problems  become apparent when it is
pointed out that when a prison magazine such as
ours s gea hat are more
than a statistical outline of printing prison happen.-</p>
<p>ings, then our problems become more complex. The
writers consume more time in articles presented by
wgathering fuctual dat through research; and the eo-</p>
<p>ation of this data into article or story form. The
need to be accurate becomes more acuie cspecially
when you are submitt erial that.deals with
real facts and events in saciety. Also the manuseripts
submitted are read by the inmate staff for their ap-
proval and then submitted to an offcial staf for their
comments and approval (See Summer Tssuc - 1966
Editorial). The actual printing of this magazine is
a prime Eactor also, as our printing plant is set up
‘s part of an indusiry printing for state owned and
state aided agencies in the State of Pennsylvania.
Hence, the Eastern Echo’s printing must be handled
as part of 4 “‘customer manufacturing need” like
any other business order. It is this vocational inte-
gration that lends itself to teaching printing skills
and encountering problems comparable to what the
man will face in the productive * outside society.””</p>
<p>Another aspect of the Eastern Echo’s ereed s to
present the best type of objective writing possible
A'sad but true fact s the minimizing of 2 man’s past
‘against society by 0 many of the Penal Press</p>
<p>today. A prime example is the
in which the conviet is depicted
g, and the like, in</p>
<p>order to prove a point in favor of the argument pre-
sented. The majority of the Eastern Echo’s stafl
through the years have endeavored to eliminate this
type of sloppy sentimentality. It has not, of course,
been always stiecessful. The unnatural subjectiveness
that is in most of s, due to our environment,
s u contributing factor to this kind of emotionalism.
The Eastorn Echo has made it policy to strike</p>
<p>a balanee in considering the man as he hus proved
limself, regardless of the wrong of yesteryear. Thus,
ou will find the words *‘Rehabilitation or Revenge’’
quoted in so many of the articles printed in this</p>
<p>stealing apples,’”</p>
<p>of the Eastern Echo are woven into
the words, *'Be broad and progressive in your out-
Toak.”” T do this, the magazine must keep striving
for_mprovement. The best way is o present all
telligent manner. To be ready to
face refutation with the courage of convietion, *di
agrecably agreeable.”” To ever keep in mind that this
't one man’s sole property, but  con.
instrument of creativity for ll the prisons’
habitants. It is interlocked in the words of your
thor who stressed the fact of “helping the man to
Tnelp himself. through the medium of writing.”</p>
<p>A Word from C.</p>
<p>MY ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>In the ten years I have had the privilege of being
associated with the Echo staf, I have observed the
worked in various</p>
<p>capacities in the preparat
Publication.</p>
<p>The person who writes an article must be versed
in english and all its ramifications. The type-setter
must bive the proper mechanical training and expe-
rience, The operator of the proof press as well as
the proof-reader camnot be excused for errors. Print-
ing the article for publication becomes the responsi
bility of the pressmen. He must not only have o
knowledge of the mechanics of his pres, but also
the appearance and readability of the insertion fall
heavily upon his shoulders. Binding the magazine
must be done with precision and good judgement.
Finally, the shipper must be trained to kiow how to
prepare the copies for distribution within the instito.

<p>With proper application and with satisfactory
achievement in any one of these departments a man
can qualify for placement in the printing industey. T

in'all of these processes, from beginning to end. These

ECHO’S 10th ANNIVERSARY</p>
<p>The Echo serves a threefold purpose. Mainly it
is a media for transmission of ideas and thonghts
both educational and controversial. Secondly it beid:
ges a gap all to frequently overlooked or minimized—
that of our outside population huving none or very
little concept of the setion and activities going on
in a correctional institution.</p>
<p>Lastly, from the individual outlook with regard
to ones livelihood, is the training aspect whether it
be as u skilled craftsman or o fledgling reporter or
writer, as an instrument toward self expression and
technique of presentation.</p>
<p>In conclusion such a publication is most impor-
tant since constant communication can promote better
understanding and human relatio</p>
