<p>History of</p>
<p>The
Fastern
Feho</p>
<p>By Tommy Williams</p>
<p>The Penal Press is the offcial voice of men
American prisons. Its origin is dubious and spec
lative at best. Any notoricty has been of a dualistic
nature ranging from verbal acelaim to voeiferous
condemnation.  Yet, the Penal Press has survived,
mainly because many persons realized the benefits
of a constructive outlet through writing. The writ
ings have been varied, but the slant has always bee
directed at. prisons, and_ people in prison. This is
ot to say that this central theme has been the totality
of the inmate’s thought. Prison being the dominating
Sactor in the expression of thoughts through writing,
can be justified, considering the closed environmer
in which prisoner’s live. The writings of the Penal
Press have run the gamut in format; from the one
page sheets to the forty page slick eover magazines
of many of our larger prisons.</p>
<p>The Eastern Echo is the magazine printed here
at the State Correctional Institutional at Philadelph
It had its beginning ten years ago us o fledgling 20
page affair. Iis inception can be attributed to the
ideas and official sanction of many. Ticluded was
Mr. Frank G. Martin (Warden at that time - now
deceased) and the offcial treatment staff. However
the plans, groundwork and first edition ean be cred-
ited to one man, Jerry Culp, the maguzine's first
editor. His goals regarding the Eastern Echo could
not be et in motion by himself as he was due to be
released from prison soon after the “Echo’s’” first
publication date. Knowing this, he wrote his first
and last editorial as a sort of credo, which successive
editors have vainly sought to follow. T think it is
appropriate that a few paragraphs of this editorial
be quoted to illustrate the central meaning of this
‘man’s idea.</p>
<p>i</p>
<p>“Dear Reader:</p>
<p>the first issue of the Bastern Echo.
e is the newest entry into the penal

<p>press field.
to present articles, poems, and stories which ex-</p>
<p>press the thoughts and feeli
fined at this institation.</p>
<p>““The Eastern Echo is your magazine. Tt
will be only as good as you want it to be.</p>
<p>““The Eastern Echo is intended to be the
vaice of the men in here, How powerfl a voice
depends upon the quality and quantity of the
‘material submitted.</p>
<p>““Many of us have long looked forward fo
&amp; publication for this institution. Sinee T will
e here for only this issue T would like to advance
my hope that the Eastern Echo will continue to
grow and take its place among the top members
of the Penal Press fild. Keep this magazine
as the voice of all the men in here and not of
just one group, Remember that the articles and
Storics published by the Eastorn Echo will be
read by many citizens of this and other states.
Poor material will reflect on all. Good material
will bring favorable responses and undoubted
benefts. Make the Eastern Echo broad and pro-
gressive in its outlook.</p>
<p>ngs of the men con-</p>
<p>““Guard this tiny new flame of yours against</p>
<p>the glory secker and the irresponsible. A new
freedom has been handed to you by those in
authority. They will wait to see how you aceept</p>
<p>the responsibiity.””</p>
<p>This editorial speaks for itself. Tt lays down the
broad guidelines of Echo policy which subsequent
edifors have felt obligated to follow. The words are
of another decade but time has not erased the value
of them.</p>

since its auspicious beginning. They are here listed
