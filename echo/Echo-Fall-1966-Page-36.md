Preceded by a serics of dedicated practice ses.
sions (an altogether unusual setivity for the citizens
of these parts) ES.P, football, '66 version, was
vieled on Lubor Day with o spirited pre-season exhil
tion game featuring the Angels and 1965 champion
Conquerors, won by the Conquerors 12 to 6. Septen-
ber 11, the **new”” Packers fade their debut (also
an exhibition) a successful one by besting the Angels
1210 7. League play began September 18, 1966,

As in past years three teams again participated
in the league—ANGELS, CONQUERORS and the
PACKERS under *‘new’” management. Al well bal
anced and evenly matched us is attested to by the
fact that there were no less than 6 scorcless ties
involving all three teams.

Following, in the order of their respective won-
loss records, is a review of the teams and personnel

The CONQUERORS experienced some minor
diffeulty recruiting and as the season got underway
it looked as if last vears champs might be this years
““chumps.”" But there was George Miketish and Cal
vin Milligan (“Mr. Quarterback) to be reckoned
with. “Mac”” kept hustling hither and yon get
the necessary ““autographs,” and Calvin, wel, o
time he can’gather 10 other guys and a footbill to
gether he’s going fo make things rough for the
opposition.

Some of last year's Conquerors still remain and
formed the nuclews around which this years feam was
built—Russell Budd, *‘Rosy”" Minter, “Big Six’*
Connors, Jimmy Hovt and Milligan himself. Also
acquiting themselves Tike true Conquerors were - C. C.
Clark, Murray Dickerson, Charley Butler, Andrew
Lopes, James Brickhouse, Martin Swoboda, ““Gypsy'

Ferce, Joe Salladino, Leonard Massey, John Lujack,
Alvey Chauney, Steve Schartner, Robert Cole, Fred

joerner, William Corbett, Dennis Shields and Charles
‘Rocky"” Negri. The latier two joined the team for
the last two games and were of definite help in the
clinching of the championship.

Calvin Milligan, field general of these gridiron
titans, demonstrated week affer week, his competence
in this role. Calvin’s particular brand of football is
based upon systematically undermining o specific area
of the oppositions defense. The merit of this strategy
18 evident in that teams under his leadership have won
two championships in @ row

The fans were particularly impressed with the
**power sweep”” used so effeetively with *‘Rosy” Min.
ter stepping_ beautifully along behind tremendous
blocking by all-pro’s Russell Budd, James Brickhouse,
*“Gypsy” Ferce and Martin Swobods, the strong side
of the Conguerors line. Often providing the key block
which enabled a runner to spring free for the long
scoring runs would be the ofher running backs. C.
Clark, “*Sonny”” Lopes, Murray Dickerson, * Beau’*
Massey and Calvin himself.

The important role of a tough, good blocking

line is known o all of us and need ot be discnssed
at any great length here, suffice it to say the
aueror line did its “job.” And thereby permitted
the backs to do theirs; which after all comes down
to what the gume js all about. A team effort on the
part of eleven individuals.

The d
plaudit recei

sive players of this team deserve every
d. Opponents total score for 7 games
Which, if my arithmetic is
correct, uverages out o 1 point o game. Led by
Budd, Brickhouse, Cole, Chauncy, Schartner, and the
leading pass intereeptor of the léngue, Massey, these
uys did one whale of & job.

Keeping an ear to the ground enables one to
pick up quite a bit (besides dirt, that is) and so far
I haven't heard any vociferous cries to ““break-up’”
the Conquerors, a disgruntled crack or tyo, but noth-
ing to get really oxeited about, Besides, the only way
they could **break-up” the Conquerors would be to
send us all home.

plaed were 7 points

Congratulations Conguerors! Champions of the
B.SP. football scene for the second straight year.

ANGELS

The ANGELS, a Lomax and Welty production,

mediate rave notices from all of BS.P. fan.
not n few of whom are most eritieal in regard
to upstart new football feams.

Losing 2 successive exhibition games made for
some momentary pessimistic speculation, but when the
offcial league play began the Angels grabbed first
place by winning 2, and tying 2 in their first four
starts (AIl of which gocs io show a poor exhibition
or two does ot a season make). Tn their last 4 games
they won 1, lost 2, and tied for a final record of 3
wins, 2 losses, 3 séoreless ties

Comprising the heaviest_(average) line in_the
Ieague this vear were Ronald *Big Boy”” Lomax, 210;
John **E] Snako”” Welty, 230; Dave Haan, 220; Con-
way, 200; Stanley Moroz, 190. Les Karver and Otis
Halloway were offensive ends. *“Hillbilly”” was the
all important center. Calling the signals at quarter-
back was Harry **Roll.out” Zietz, who had “‘a very
ood year."” Handling the fullback chores was Henry
*‘Big Hank"” Buckery who likes to run the ball; left-
half ‘was Marvin Thompson,  picture runner; Mr.
Blocking Back’" S. Cantoral provided his usual co
sistent brand of play, and McMillan and *Goodie!
Goodman rounded out the backfield. Alfred Sheppard,
Steve, Joe Massanova, James Banks, ““Dutch’” Bagely,
““Red”” Smith and William **Pencil Willie'” Thornton
all specialized on defense and did a very commendable
Job.

Coach Billy Cantoral “spotting,” shuttling play-

ers in and out of the line-up, and shouting words of

encouragement to the men on the field, handled

diffcult assignment like he’d been aronnd the game
awhile.” (He has, and that's a fact)

““Pencil Willie’” sustained an aggravating knee
injury early in the season and was ont the remainder
of the year. The Angels sorely missed his stellar de.
fensive line play.
