History of

The
Fastern
Feho

By Tommy Williams

The Penal Press is the offcial voice of men
American prisons. Its origin is dubious and spec
lative at best. Any notoricty has been of a dualistic
nature ranging from verbal acelaim to voeiferous
condemnation.  Yet, the Penal Press has survived,
mainly because many persons realized the benefits
of a constructive outlet through writing. The writ
ings have been varied, but the slant has always bee
directed at. prisons, and_ people in prison. This is
ot to say that this central theme has been the totality
of the inmate’s thought. Prison being the dominating
Sactor in the expression of thoughts through writing,
can be justified, considering the closed environmer
in which prisoner’s live. The writings of the Penal
Press have run the gamut in format; from the one
page sheets to the forty page slick eover magazines
of many of our larger prisons.

The Eastern Echo is the magazine printed here
at the State Correctional Institutional at Philadelph
It had its beginning ten years ago us o fledgling 20
page affair. Iis inception can be attributed to the
ideas and official sanction of many. Ticluded was
Mr. Frank G. Martin (Warden at that time - now
deceased) and the offcial treatment staff. However
the plans, groundwork and first edition ean be cred-
ited to one man, Jerry Culp, the maguzine's first
editor. His goals regarding the Eastern Echo could
not be et in motion by himself as he was due to be
released from prison soon after the “Echo’s’” first
publication date. Knowing this, he wrote his first
and last editorial as a sort of credo, which successive
editors have vainly sought to follow. T think it is
appropriate that a few paragraphs of this editorial
be quoted to illustrate the central meaning of this
‘man’s idea.

““Guard this tiny new flame of yours against

the glory secker and the irresponsible. A new
freedom has been handed to you by those in
authority. They will wait to see how you aceept

the responsibiity.””

This editorial speaks for itself. Tt lays down the
broad guidelines of Echo policy which subsequent
edifors have felt obligated to follow. The words are
of another decade but time has not erased the value
of them.
