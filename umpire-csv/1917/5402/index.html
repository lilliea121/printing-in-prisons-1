<p>HONOR CLUB NOTES Each member or guest who attended the entertainment on St. Patrick’s Day, 1917, will retain pleasant memories of the last show the 2nd Section will see this season. From the first number, when Professor Wiegandt, with the H. F. C. orchestra, performed the overture, “The Burgomaster,” until the finish when the Quartette of Beauties, under the able leadership of Miss Mae Russell, and the entire audience joining in singing, “Tipperary,” it was one continuous thrill of pleasure after another. Before opening the performance, Mr. Kraupa took occasion to announce the amount donated by each block on this, the last performance of the 2nd Section. The. amount each block and gallery had donated and each amount, was appreciated. Mr. Kraupa then commended the 2nd Section for their liberality, promising them his future interest at all times. Vice-President (A 8432) thanked the members and proposed a rising vote of thanks for Miss Mae Russell, Mr. Kraupa, Jimmy Mulligan, and each and every performer and friend who had shown interest in the Honor and Friendship Club by giving and encouraging these entertainments. Every member arose. Continuing, Pete said, “Especially do we thank our Warden, Mr. Robt. J. McKenty, for his kindness and broad judgment in permitting conditions to exist in this penitentiary, whereby an inmate, although a convict, can demonstrate that he remains a man, and in treating him as such enables him to show his appreciation by his conduct.” The picture, a fine arts production, with Sir Herbert Beerbohn Tree in “The Old Folks at Home,” was practically adapted to the audience. The scenes of home life on the farm, the young man’s advent into the city, the fast life he led, the resulting crime, with his father’s sacrifice of his wealth, and the mother’s love, influencing the jury to permit sentiment to overcome law, was a bid for the deepest and best in every one who followed the story in scenes, and the applause rang true when the verdict of the jury was “not guilty,” and the son was given back to his mother. Yes, it was a stirring picture, and it required an effort to turn to the lighter amusement of the vaudeville. However, the moment that Miss Marian Hilliard was announced, the audience forgot the sensations of the picture under the spell of the beauty and grace of Miss Hilliard. Her singing, first of “The Honolulu-Ukulele” song, to be followed (on encore) by two more songs, was splendid, and the applause was long and loud. Professor Ott, ventriloquist, the next number, was very clever, with a performance in ventriloquism with his two little men “Mickie’? and Sam. His work was perfect. His other number, the dog turn, was very fine, and the acting of the dog was wonderful. It appeared to enjoy the applause equally as well as did the Professor. Miss Frances King, who has pleased the members before, was again the star. She opened with the song, “On the Old Dominion Line,” but she has such a warm spot in the hearts of the H. F. C. that at one time it appeared as though they wanted her for the whole show. One of her songs after the fourth encore, had a whistling part that Miss King (Continued on page 4.) (Continued from page 1.) performed in a manner both perfect and pleasing. She must have been well pleased with the applause. Lewis and Carvin, a clever comedy musical team, was the next number and they gave a performance that was well received and loudly applauded. Miss Helen Muller, the Nordica of Vaudeville, was the announcement of a good turn in a beautiful costume by an artist of beauty and rare attainments. Her singing was good, and the applause brought her back for three encores. Baker and Emmett, musicians par excellence, was the next, and a musical treat on banjos, tuba and clarinet, was enjoyed by all who love good music. We had Master John Quillian, a young artist from canny Scotland, and a protégé of Harry Lauder, Miss Russell was pleased to say, and his performance was good. His success in this country is assured. He submitted to three encores, and then the applause was thunderous. A brave little man is Master Quillian, who showed his gameness under conditions that would have floored many older artists. Then, fresh from the Great White Way of Allentown, came Miss Lillian Langdon, the ragtime queen. Miss Langdon bore out the good name she left when she was here before, and she leaves nothing but friends and well-wishers in the H. F. C. Again and again was she encored, and she responded to the calls. Miss Russell then announced Reynolds— “Nut” Reynolds, Miss Russell said—the human fly. All who saw Reynolds on Saturday will for all future time expect to read in any paper of—well, don’t let’s say it; but everyone looks for it. We were first shown a film of Reynolds climbing up a 45-story building, with the crowd looking at him. Then he did some stunts juggling balls, while balanced on tilted chairs upon tables piled high in the air. All who saw Reynolds would have helped gather him up had he lost his balance. All united in saying “wonderful” when speaking of his coolness and nerve during his performance. Then came the “hit” of the performance —what Miss Mae Russell termed a bevy of beauty Honor and Friendship Quartette. Under the spotlight there appeared four beautiful maids—Miss Lillian Langdon, Miss Marian Hilliard, and Miss Helen Muller—and marshaled by (to the H. F. C.) the best and most beautiful of them all, Miss Mae Russell, the quartette marched and sang “Tipperary,” with the audience joining in the chorus. It was good to hear and see the pleasure on the faces turned toward the stage. This taking up all the time, the other movie had to be foregone. The real result of this afternoon, and other afternoons of a like enjoyment, may not be observed at just this time, but the future is when the benefit will be shown. The man in his cell tonight, recalling the enjoyment of today, will have no room for vengeful thoughts. Every moment of those four hours will tend to create a healthier condition within each mind. All praise and thanks to our Warden for permitting these conditions, and all thanks to our friends who: show an interest in the H. F. C.Mrs. R. C. McKenty, Miss Elsie and a lady friend, were in attendance, and their presence was appreciated by all. The Hon. Mrs. Craven, a sister-in-law of Lord Craven, an English baronet, was with Mrs. Alice Buzby, an honorary member of the H. F. C., guests of Miss Mae Russell. Jimmy Mulligan (the man in the box) had young Mr. Mulligan and Herbert Kraupa for guests. With the performance of March 24th the movies will close for the season, although Mr. Kraupa gave assurance from the stage that any rainy Saturday this summer he was ready to respond to the call and bring out the films Some friend, Mr. Kraupa! On Saturday, March 24th, the 1st Section— 3rd B, 5th B, 7th G, 7B, 4G, 4B, 5G. —B 7542.</p>
