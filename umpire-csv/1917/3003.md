Recommends Amendment to Prison Labor Act   The annual report of the Pennsylvania Prison Labor Commission, made to Governor Brumbaugh last week, recommends an amendment to the act of 1915 permitting state prisoners to draw actual wages of from ten to fifty cents per day and to have the balances due to them paid at their discharge. There is also another amendment suggested, intended to provide occupation for prisoners. The latter amendment would oblige state institutions to purchase available supplies from the commission at open market prices. As stated in the report, such purchases have been disappointing, but the commission believes that this trade will eventually extend to large proportions.
