Swearing on the Bible   The method of swearing by the Bible came into use at a very early period, practically with the establishment of courts of law in Christian countries. It was the ordinary method of swearing when America was settled by Europeans and was naturally adopted here. Oaths were common before the Christian era, and any form may be used that conforms to the religious belief of the person to be sworn. Hebrews are often sworn on the Pentateuch, keeping on their hats, and their oath ends with the words, "So help me, Jehovah.'' A Mohammedan is sworn on the Koran.
