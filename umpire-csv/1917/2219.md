Sent to Jail for Libeling Washington   A correspondent says that "for libeling the memory of George Washington, Paul Haffer, a Socialist, has been sentenced to four months in the county jail at Tacoma, Wash. A year ago Haffer wrote a letter to the newspapers saying that the father of his country was a slave-owner, drank liquor and used bad lan- guage.''
