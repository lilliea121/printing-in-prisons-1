MY PENKNIFE*    By B 8244    Only a little penknife,    A delicate, dainty thing!    But it means to me a ray of hope,    And it makes my glad heart sing;—    O life’s wasted years and bitter tears!    They recall the days of youth,    When I trod the ways that lead to death,    The ways that know not truth.    Only a little penknife,    With a delicate handle of pearl!    The gift to me from the fair hand    Of all that is best in a girl;—    O angels of mercy in Heaven,    Look down today from the skies,    Make me love her whom God gave me,    Keep her image before my eyes.    Only a little penknife,    With two tiny blades of steel!—    Cut from my heart all guilt and sin    As on bended knees I kneel;—    And O God, in Thy infinite mercy,    Take Thou my wasted life,    Teach me to love with all my heart    The woman who is my wife.       * A lady recently paid a visit to her husband, who is serving a short term in the Eastern State Penitentiary. Her parting gift was a tiny pearl handled penknife.       Never wait for a thing to turn up. Go and turn it up yourself. It takes less time and it is surer to be done.
