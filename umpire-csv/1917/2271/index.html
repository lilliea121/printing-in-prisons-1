<p>LIVE AND KEEP ON LEARNING “If you die before you are eighty-five years old you come to an untimely end.” Earl Barnes, of New York, an exponent of longevity and defier of Dr. Osler, made a large audience sit up and take notice when he made this statement recently. “Thirty-five per cent of the world’s greatest work has been done in the age decade between sixty and seventy years, 21 per cent. between seventy and eighty, and 6 percent above eighty.” Mr. Barnes cited a score of political, scientific, philosophical, commercial and military leaders who are just beginning their work at sixty years. “The man who does one thing continuously is old at forty,” he said. ‘But get out and study, travel and broaden your horizon. If you are a woman, don’t put your broom in the same corner every day. Hide it. Break up your routine or you are lost. “The farmer who at fifty years turns the farm over to the boys, moves to the city and spends the remainder of his life watching the trains arrive is wasting his life. He might as well be dead, and he soon is. “There is no reason why you can’t be learning every year of your life.”</p>
