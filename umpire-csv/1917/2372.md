THE USE OF PIOUS LANGUAGE       The almost total abstinence from using “pious” language in ordinary business and social intercourse in America may be considered commendable in some ways, but I consider it a surrender of the soul to the body, a subordination of the spirit of the things which are eternal to the spirit of the things which are temporal. In my judgment the superior culture of the West, instead of limiting the vocabulary of religion to the one hour of formal worship on Sunday and scrupulously shunning it during the remainder of the week, should make its use on a much higher plane than the Orient has yet discovered, coextensive with all the activities of life.
