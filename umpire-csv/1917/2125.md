Caught After Ten Years Liberty   A rather remarkable story came to light recently from Austin, Minn., telling how for more than ten years Wenzel Kabat, an escaped convict, fought to rehabilitate himself as "William Coles." So successful were his efforts that he twice obtained nomination as a candidate for the state legislature. Now he is on his way back to the state prison of Wisconsin to finish his life sentence as the convicted murderer ten years ago of G. McCarthy, a farmer.   Kabat came to Austin less than two years ago and established a tailor shop. Later he became employed in a packing plant. The son of the owner, glancing through an old pamphlet of "men wanted" recognized his photograph as the picture of "William Coles "
