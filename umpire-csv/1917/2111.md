Well, Why Is It?    A prominent writer asks, "Why is it, when you are in a hurry, that-   ''There are no means of locomotion in sight?   "You haven't any change?   "Every one bumps into you?   "You remember you have left the front   door open?   ''All the streets are blocked?   "The last train has just gone?   ''You are held up by some bore?   ''You see the most beautiful girl in the   world?   "Your watch is wrong?   The other person is late and you are kept waiting an hour?"
