Shade of City Hall No Hindrance   The need of better police protection in the neighborhood of Thirteenth and Market Streets, is asserted by the members of the firm of Wertheimer Brothers, who discovered Friday morning that burglars had plundered their shirtwaist factory at 1315 Market Street, a few doors from City Hall, on Tuesday night, for the third time within four years, getting silks worth $1000.   Detectives said the robbers evidently had hidden in the building in the daytime, and had ransacked the workshop after the employes had gone home.
