Detectives Versus the Law   Under the above title an editorial writer in the Ledger comments on the illegal acts of private detectives, in which he says:   "It is just as well that the New York court, while showing its sympathy with the cause of Detective William J. Burns in the "Morgan spy" issue, fined him for an illegal act committed in his search for evidence, since he exceeded his rights as a citizen and detective and usurped those that belong to officers of the law, and then only when armed with the necessary authority. The fact is that through the glamour of the various detective stories and "society burglar" plays that delight the public, in which the male and the female detectives do about as they please since they are police, district attorneys, judges and juries all rolled into one and without supervision or responsibility, we have become rather dazed. Moreover, in actuality the illegal acts of detectives, which at times come very near and at others pass over the line of blackmail, tend to confuse the public   Â·as to its rights and where alleged operative interference begins and ends. Consequently, the decision against Burns, since it also called attention to a legal way in which he could have got the papers wanted, is a salutary and a timely one. Of course, those engaged in anti-social and criminal conspiracies call for small respect or consideration on the part of those who are engaged in running them down. But in other matters it is best for the community as a whole, unless the work be done under the advice and under the form of the law, that private detectives should learn that their supposed freedom from immunity is something that will not stand the test of the courts, and they should govern themselves accordingly."
