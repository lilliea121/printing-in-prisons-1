City is Self-Conscious   The city life is conscious of itself, the small town life itself is not, asserts Seymour Deeming in the Atlantic. An army of fairly competent minds is busy interpreting the life of the city to itself, and this so thoroughly that not a teamster or ribbon-counter clerk of the urban lot but has his spokesman in the public prints and partakes somewhere of the typical. And the sales person who has once seen sales people elevated to the rank of printed or acted comedy or tragedy is conscious of a new sense of personal consequence which years of obscurity are powerless wholly to erase. To have had one's social setting touched by the wand of art is to have shaken hands with a celebrity; life is never afterward quite the same drab commonplace.
