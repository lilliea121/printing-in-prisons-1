When Petroleum Was Free   It is said that the first reference made about the discovery of petroleum in Ameri- ca was contained in a letter written in 1629 by Joseph de la Roche d'Allion, a French missionary working among the Indians. He had crossed the Niagara river and made his way southward through west- ern New York into northern Pennsylvania, where he found .a spring from which oil flowed, according to a writer in the Advance. This oil was highly esteemed by the Indians for medicinal uses.   The letter of the priest was published in 1632 in Sagard's "Histoire du Canada." This oil spring was probably identical with the one described by the Massachusetts Magazine in 1789:   "In the northern part of Pennsylvania there is a creek called Oil creek, which emp- ties into the Allegheny river. It issues from a spring on the top of which floats an oil similar to that called Barbados tar and from which one may gather several gallons a day. The troops sent to guard the western posts halted at the same sÎ¼ring, collected some of the oil and bathed their joints with it. This   gave them great relief from the rheumatism with which they were afflicted.''
