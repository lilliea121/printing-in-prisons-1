Sentenced to Twenty Days in Bed    "Local No. 1, Branch 711, Sons of Rest," organized by fourteen Industrial Workers of the World when they began a twenty-day sentence in a prison camp near Duluth, Minn., was dissolved recently when the men were released. They had declared a strike against any form of manual labor, and for punish- ment were sent to bed for twenty days and kept there, except for meals.
