MORNING    There was a roaring in the wind all night; . . .    But now the sun is rising calm and bright;    The birds are singing in the distant woods;    Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods;    The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters;    And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.       All things that love the sun are out of doors;    The sky rejoices in the morning’s birth;    The grass is bright with rain drops;—on the moors ;    The hare is running races in her mirth;    And with her feet she from the plashy earth    Raises a mist; that, glittering in the sun,    Runs with her all the way, wherever he ‘doth run. . . .    —Wordsworth.
