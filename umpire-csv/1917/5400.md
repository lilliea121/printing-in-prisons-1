SEWS ON AMPUTATED ARM A noted surgeon, who recently returned from Europe, tells of a remarkable operation performed on the son-in-law of James Oâ€™Grady, M. P. He was severely wounded at the Front some months ago and it was necessary to amputate an arm. The surgeon carried out the daring experiment of removing the injured part of the bone and attaching the arm again and sewing it together. The operation was so successful that the patient can use the arm again. He is able to lift a cup of tea slowly to his mouth. The only thing noticeable is that the injured arm is slightly shorter than the other.
