Over 1,000 Useless Laws to Come up for Repeal   It is stated on reliable authority from Harrisburg-, that bills providing for the striking off of over 1,000 obsolete laws from the statute books of the state, are being prepared at the State Legislative Reference Bureau, and will probably be complete the latter part of this month. The laws affected are said to include antiquated penal and otherwise useless measures that hinder rather than further the interests of social welfare.   During the session of 1915 an ''omnibus repealer'' was passed which would have taken about the same number of laws from the books, but it was vetoed for the reason that there were some doubts about the procedure in including laws of various subjects in one repealer.   In r,il r::u:bability there will be grouping of old laws according to subjects so that all of the same class will be under a similar heading. There may be fifty or sixty such Â·bills, all depending upon the number of bills to be repealed. No attempt will be made to repeal any bills except those which have been declared unconstitutional by the courts, which have been repealed but not stricken from the books, which have been superseded or duplicated. The work is in charge of James N. Moore, director of the bureau.
