<p>The Origin of “Chap”The word ''chap'' -is said to be simply an abbreviation of chapman, the merchant of former days, and is derived from the Anglo-Saxon ''cheap,'' a bargain. The word almost brings before us the loud voiced ''cheap Jack&quot; as he cries his wares in the cheaping or market. Chap seems to have come into common use at the end of the sixteenth century and is rarely mentioned in books before 1700. Johnson does not recognize it, though Steele uses it in 1712 in the Spectator (&quot;If you want to sell, here is your chap&quot;), and it is found in Bailey's Dictionary, 1731. Its original meaning of a buyer or seller still lingers in the dialects of many counties. Coupled with the adjectives old, young, little, poor, it was and is used in familiar language, as it is relative, a queer &quot;customer.&quot; Todd, 1818, affirms that a good chap meant one to whom credit might be given, whereas not qualified by good it was a term of contempt.</p>
