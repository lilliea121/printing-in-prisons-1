Game of Cards Sends 10 to Hospital and 15 to Jail   It proved a costly game of cards when a "marked" deck was found to be in play in a poker game at Shire Oaks, a railroad junction near Monongahela, a Â·riot resulted. State police, railroad detectives and Monongahela constables were rushed to the scene in an engine.   Fifteen arrests were made, while ten others went to the Memorial Hospital, Monongahela, to have their injuries attended. Three men, who were strangers in the motley array, were charged with having placed the "marked" deck in play.   Alderman Elwood, of Monongahela, committed the prisoner.
