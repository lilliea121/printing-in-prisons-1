Monday’s Game    Cubs vs. Ninth    The Cubs-Ninth game at the Garage grounds on Monday, was the only event of the day and it drew a large assemblage of fans to witness a closely contested struggle for honors, as each team seemed determined to win.       Though several critical situations developed during the game, no deciding run was made and the final round left a tie to be played off later. The players seemed anxious to show their mettle by scoring a winning run, but fortune did not favor the brave on this occasion.       Two base hits—Chick, Boston and Mack.    Struck out—by Boyd, 10; by Mack, 7.    Umpires—Stackhouse and Barrington.
