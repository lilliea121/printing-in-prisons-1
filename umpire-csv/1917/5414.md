THE STORY OF A FAMOUS HYMN    The famous hymn beginning “God moves in a mysterious way,” known as “Cowper’s Hymn,” had its-origin as fellows: Cowper was all his life the victim of melancholia and more than once attempted suicide. One day, bent upon destroying himself, he got into a cab and ordered the driver to take him toa certain point on the river where he intended to drown himself. The cabman, noticing his strange appearance and feeling that all might not be right with him, drove him about the city and finally stopped in front of the poet’s door. Stepping out and recognizing the old familiar surroundings and shocked at the thought of his narrow escape, Cowper exclaimed, “God moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform,” and, rushing in, immediately composed the immortal hymn.
