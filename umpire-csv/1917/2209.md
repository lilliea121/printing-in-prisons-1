Frohman’s Little Safe   It is told of Charles Frohman that when he was treasurer with Haverly's Minstrels, he conceived a novel scheme of arousing curi- osity “in small towns. He bought a small iron safe, about three feet high, and on it had painted in big letters, 'Treasurer, Haverly’s Mastodon Minstrels.' Now actually there was little need for this safe, but it was always carried on the first load of baggage that went to a hotel. It would be placed in a conspicuous place, and then Frohman, wait- ing until the proper moment, would bustle up to it with an air of great importance, open it, put in two or three $100 bills, close it, and go away. When the crowd had gone he would slip back and get the money out again. It proved a good advertising stunt."
