<p>Patient Waiting Not in VainIt is hard to say farewell to a hope that has cheered us, unloose the clasp of what seemed an undying friendship, â€¢,oseealoved friend sail away and pass out of our sight regardless of our outstretched hands and the emotion it may cause us. Yet many of us, no doubt, at some time in our lives, have stood alone and wrung our hanch; 'and wept inwardly at parting with what would never again come back; and still, to such as are broken thereby, such partings and memories are not in vain. There are things back of us which are known only to the Power Above, which did greatly shape our lives. These are the faces of friends, the pressure of their hands, the memory of a song, and the vision of those who are no more, which we treasure greatly; thei,;;e are those with true faith sufficiently to think that, at some future time, the old familiar faces will again be seen, the sweet-toned voices heard once more, and the lost things we valued will come sailing in like returning ships parted in a great gale, at the grey of morn, with sails all awash and fairer than when they went,come scudding back to anchorage; patiently waiting with watchful eyes for the day when the sky is cleared, like some exiled one detained from his loved companion s, waiting wistfully and steadfastly in the faith that&quot;our Redeemer liveth,&quot; and will come to remove the bars that keep us many days from our loved ones and freedom.-B 7401.</p>
