HER BOY    When their only son was 25 years old he went to work. His mother hated to see him do it, but his heartless father said it was the best thing for him to do. The boy started to work one Monday morning and the poor mother worried all day. The youngster only weighed 200 pounds and she knew well enough that he was too delicate for the task he was expected to perform. She had a splendid supper ready for him, and to insure that he wouldn’t get cold during the night she took a quilt from pa’s bed and put it on his. Two hours after the son reached home, a little man, weighing about 100 pounds, entered the house. It was pa. Mother had just fixed son in bed and wrapped a hot blanket about his feet, and she carried pa’s overcoat in and threw it across the foot of the boy’s bed. Pa told her she had done right in getting son to bed early and that she should get him out early in the morning so he could reach his work on time.       “He is not going to work tomorrow,” said mother. “I phoned the man that he could just get someone else to do his work. I am not going to let him make a slave out of my baby.”
