Sacred Song Service on the Center   A well rendered song service was given by the members of St. Philips' P. E. church choir, on the Center, at this institution on Sunday last. The program consisted of a   tuneful array of sacred song well calculated to please and impress the inmates.   The singers appeared to be in good voice and evinced a clever degree of fine shading in the various parts calling for careful expression. In all a pleasing afternoon of   song, and we hope for an early return of our entertainers.
