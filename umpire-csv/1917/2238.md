About the LouvreIt is said that the Louvre dates away back to the reign of Dagobert in 628. In 1204 it was a prison and in 1364 was made in to a library. The new building was begun by Francis I in 1528 and enlarged and adorned by successive kings, principally by Louis XIV. But it was Napoleon I who gave the Louvre its real glory. Turning it into a museum, Napoleon d e posited in it the finest collection of paintings, statues and art treasures known in the world. The magnificent buildings of the new Louvre were begun by Napoleon I and completed by Napoleon III about 1857.
