<p>When Petroleum Was FreeIt is said that the first reference made about the discovery of petroleum in Ameri- ca was contained in a letter written in 1629 by Joseph de la Roche d'Allion, a French missionary working among the Indians. He had crossed the Niagara river and made his way southward through west- ern New York into northern Pennsylvania, where he found .a spring from which oil flowed, according to a writer in the Advance. This oil was highly esteemed by the Indians for medicinal uses.The letter of the priest was published in 1632 in Sagard's &quot;Histoire du Canada.&quot; This oil spring was probably identical with the one described by the Massachusetts Magazine in 1789:&quot;In the northern part of Pennsylvania there is a creek called Oil creek, which emp- ties into the Allegheny river. It issues from a spring on the top of which floats an oil similar to that called Barbados tar and from which one may gather several gallons a day. The troops sent to guard the western posts halted at the same sÎ¼ring, collected some of the oil and bathed their joints with it. Thisgave them great relief from the rheumatism with which they were afflicted.''</p>
