The Folly of Crime Crime is beyond the least lucrative occupation. To begin with, stolen goods can only be sold in certain markets. The "fence" naturally takes advantage of circumstances and pays a ridiculous fraction of actual value.When years of penal servitude are considered and the sum total of earnings during such periods added to these precarious gleanings, the average income from a criminal career is less than that from the lowest form of Â·menial labor.In brief, crooks work harder, get less out of life, undergo more suffering and deprivation than any other class of people.No thief ever continued his calling and died in comfort. The most notorious felons spent their last days in outrageous poverty.Nobody can accomplish much with his hands tied. Wrong is such a handicap and offers so few opportunities that native ability, however remarkable, is shackled and discounted by knavery.It stands to reason that an individual can go farther with the goodwill of the community than with its opposition.-Herbert Kaufman.
