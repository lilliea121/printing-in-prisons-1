Castle Garden   From information at hand we glean the facts that Castle Garden was built by the United States in the year of 1807 from the plans drawn by Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Williams, C. E., and at that time it was called Fort Clinton. In the year of 1822 it was ceded to New York City; two years later   (1824) it became a place of amusement, and sometime during the year of 1826 it received the name which it now bears. In 1845 there were Ethiopian minstrels there; in 1847-'49 theatrical companies played there; in 1850 Jenny Lind sang there; in 1855 it was closed as a place of amusement, and the commissioner of emigration took it as an emigrant depot; in 1870 it suffered from fire, and on July 9th, 1876, 1t was burned to the ground. It was rebuilt at once. In 1892 the depot was moved to Ellis Island, and Castle Garden reverted to the city, which in 1896 opened an aquarium there.
