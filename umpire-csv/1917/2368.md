THE UMPIRE DISCOURAGEMENT       “Set thee up’ waymarks; make thee high heaps: set thine heart toward the highway, even the way which thou wentest.”—(Jeremiah xxxi 21.)       Is the path so easy found,    Wanderer through the night?    —No, ah! no; yet all seemed plain    In the morning light.       From my shoulders dropped their load,    From my feet their shackles;    On the holy hill afar S   hone the tabernacles.       New in strength I leaving ran    (Strength that seemed mine own),    Naught of praise I gave ‘to God;    Now am I alone.       Broad and sloping grew the road    To its trackless end;    Many a circuit have I made,    Canst thou help me, friend?       —For the way thou wentest, search    At the break of day.    Waymarks set thee up to show,    God is all thy stay.       Make thee heaps, high heaps, to praise    His acknowledged will,    Till an highway shall appear    Unto Zion’s hill.    —The Monitor.
