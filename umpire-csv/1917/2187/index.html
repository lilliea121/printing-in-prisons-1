<h1>He Found a Grand Machine</h1>

<p>He Found a Grand MachineAs there are still many men who have not discovered their usefulness, perhaps it may be as well to repeat the following dialogue for the edification of those who may profit thereby:&quot;I say, friend, why do I not see you at the club of late?&quot;''Well, to tell the truth, my friend, I've been so decidedly busy of late that with the exception of an occasional tramp or two for my health, I've spent all my time between the house and the office.''&quot;That's exceedingly new to me, old friend. Several weeks ago I very unexpectedly ran across it-an old machine I've owned a good many years and never paid much attention to. Upon examination the thing is so monstrously wonderful, you know, that it has simply held me in openmouthed consternation. I canâ€™t actually take it in, and, bless me, I can't understand why I've so long ignored its possibilities just accepted it, you know, this wonderful inheritance of my ancestors, as something natural and quite ordinary.''&quot;Hope you've struck a money maker, old man.''&quot;Well, I believe I have, you know, and that's one of the remarkable parts about my discovery. Can you conceive, dear friend, of my never having seen its possibilities? lt's merely a piece of machinery, mind you, and let me tell you some of the things it can do. With a turn from me I can make it see or hear or speak or walk or dance or write or telephone. Why, I can, and with no effort at all, make it breathe.&quot;&quot;But , I say, what is this great thing?&quot;&quot;Why, it's nothing less than myself, and I decided to put it to work and see if I can't make a fortune out of it.&quot;</p>
