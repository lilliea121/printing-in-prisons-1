To Use Prison Labor on State Highways   Allegheny County Commissioners to Draw on E. S. P. for Men--An Anti-Cigarette Bill   A Harrisburg correspondent states that a bill was recently introduced in the House by Mr. Horne, of Cambria, providing for the use of prison labor on high ways. The County Commissioners are to be furnished the men from jail s and penitentiaries, and they must stand the expense of guarding the prisoners while at work. Under the provisions of this bill the Commissioners of Delaware County could obtain prisoners from the Western Peni- tentiary to do their road work, and the Alle- gheny County Commissioners could compel Warden McKenty, in Philadelphia, to send men from the Eastern Penitentiary to the Western county.   Another bill was also introduced by Mr. Horne, to be known as the anti-cigarette bill, which prohibits the manufacture, sale, furnishing or giving away of cigarettes or cigarette papers, and any one caught smok- ing one is liable to a ten-dollar fine. If a boy refuses t o give the name of the person who furnished him with a cigarette the bill pro- vides he shall be turned over to the juvenile court.
