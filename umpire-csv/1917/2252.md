A Humane Judge   Every now and then we hear tell of a po- lice justice who is possessed of more than the ordinary amount of astuteness in dealing with the cases which come up for adjudication. Of that kind is Judge McClive, of Bergen county, New Jersey, who deserve a niche in the hall of fame by the side of the renowned Solomon. Recently there came be- fore the justice a man who had the devilish habit of drinking strong liquor until he be- came brutalized to the point of beating his wife and destroying everything within reach in his home. The judge knew him, in fact had known him for a number of years and knew of his intemperate habits. The judge also knew that he had once occupied a pew in one of the local churches, so the judge sentenced the man to attend church, believing that a reawakened interest in his religious duties and the influence of the church would have the effect of ending his propensity for doing that which he should not do. All of which shows that there are still human beings on the police court benches and that they sometimes see the way to check up on the failings of their fell ow human beings and start them on the right track.
