Asbestos Discovered in ArizonaLarge deposits of long fibered asbestos have lately been discovered in Arizona, in the Sierra A'1~1.l3. Heretofore eighty-five per cent. of the asbestos used in the United Stateshas come from Canada, and therefore the newly discovered deposits of Arizona are of Â· great interest to American manufacturers of asbestos products, particularly those making asbestos sheet packing. The high-grade fiber which is said to exist there may permit them in a large measure, to supply the demand for a high-grade American sheet.
