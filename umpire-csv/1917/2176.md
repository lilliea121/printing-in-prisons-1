New Use for Patrol Wagon"Mooing" at her captors, a Jersey cow was recently noticed by onlookers as she rode in the patrol wagon of the Eleven the District East Girard Avenue, clackety-bang through the streets. The cow was locked up and is being held for an owner. She was discovered through a phone call to the station, at Gromley's wharf, Beach Street below East Columbia Avenue, which said a "wild animal" was prowling around in that vicinity.
