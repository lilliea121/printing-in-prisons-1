Thirteen Proves Unlucky for Labor Grafters   From late news reports it is learned that all thirteen defendants in the celebrated "labor graft'' case at Chicago, were found guilty on charges of conspiracy and maintenance of a boycott, in the Federal Court in that city. The defendants are four former business   agents of the Electrical Workers' Union and nine members of the Chicago Switchboard Manufacturers. Acts of vandalism, persecution by means of strikes and bribery were charged as the specific means by which the defendants kept outside manufacturers who   were not in the "ring" from obtaining or filling contracts.
