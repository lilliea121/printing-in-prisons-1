Catholic Mission Week at the E.S.P. Chapel   Catholic Mission services were instituted here on Sunday last, to continue through the week, under the able administration of the Rev. I. J. Maguire, S. J. All inmates interested in the uplifting influence of religfous matters should take advantage of the opportunity to hear the Rev. Father Maguire in his missionary addresses. Besides a strong personality, his power of appeal and masterly style of address are sure to make a lasting impression on all who attend the services. Bear this in mind "ye who seek the spiritual awakening."
