The Tower of Hercules   If you travel along the coast of the English channel at Dover you may see the "ruins of a Roman lighthouse that was built at the time of the Roman conquest of Britain. An- other ancient lighthouse, built less than a century after the tower of Dover, is still serving its original purpose. It was partly rebuilt, and some alterations were made in it, but in the main it is the same old structure that guided the Roman galleys as they skirted the coast of the Bay of Biscay, making their way to the Roman port of Brigantium. This is the modern harbor of La Coruna, and the lighthouse is the most ancient thing about it. The Romans called it the tower of Hercules, and the moderns have perpetuated the name. The exact date of its erection is not known, but inscriptions and other evi- dence show that it was built in the time of Trajan, between 98 and 117 A. D."
