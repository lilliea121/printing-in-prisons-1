Exchange Comments   While we can not escape the past, we can overcome it. Instead of our surrender to discouragement, rise up like a man and say, "I‘ll fight out the battle. I will meet the influence of evil deeds already committed, with the indomitable courage of my present righteous resolve. For what I have done Nature demands payment. Very well! I will discharge the debt. I will pay the bill to the last ounce of satisfaction. I will be square with Nature, with God, with my fellowmen and with myself. -Ohio Penitentiary News.      Living conditions become more complex every day for the poor man who lives by the sweat of his brow, and the half has nut been told. But it is obvious that there are all kinds of useless hardships placed upon people that would not exist were it not for the selfish greed that runs throughout the land. -The Prison Monitor.      When you see a man of average intelligence stand inside of a bar and go into voluntary liquidation every Saturday night, when booze becomes so thoroughly annealed into his life that it becomes like the air he breathes, you can safely wager your summer’s hoarding that some day he will behold the chalice containing the dregs of joy in the gateway of a state prison. -The Square Deal.
