The Law and Liquor   Without a doubt liquor dealers have at last come to realize that they are to blame in great measure for the rising tide against their business. Disregard of law and the arrogance of the the whisky business had its effect, and now it is too late to stem the tide by efforts to "reform" the traffic. Economically the saloon finds no place. Drinking men are not wanted anywhere and numerous large employers of labor have made a rule that drinking on or off duty is a ground for immediate dismissal. The doom of the licensed liquor traffic is becoming more and more apparent, and against it are based this time the arguments on experience and practical sense.
