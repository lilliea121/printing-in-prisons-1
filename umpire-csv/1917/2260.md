RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONISTS RELEASE 2200 PRISONERS    An American correspondent in Russia reports that during the recent revolution in that country, many political prisoners were released. At Kherson 1700 convicts disarmed the prison guards and broke into another wing of the jail, where they released 500 more convicts.       The released men scattered through the town, but no serious trouble has been reported.
