HOUSE BY THE SIDE OF THE ROAD   By Sam Walter Foss   There are hermit souls that live withdrawn In the peace of their self-content   There are souls, like stars, that dwell apart In a fellowless firmament   There are pioneer souls that blaze their paths    Where the highways never ran-   But let me live by the side of the road,   And be a friend to man.      Let me live in a house by the side of the road, Where the race of men go by-   The men who are good, and the men who are bad   As good and as bad as I.   I would not sit in the scorner's seat    Or hurl the cynic's ban -   Let me live in a house by the side of the road,   And be a friend to man.      I see from my house by the side of the road-   By the side of the highway of life,   The men who press with ardor of hope,    The men who are faint with strife .   But I turn not away from their smiles nor their tears-   Both parts of an Infinite plan-   Let me live by the side of the road,   And be a friend to man.      I know there are brook-gladdened meadows ahead,   And mountains of wearisome height;   And the road passes on through the long afternoon,   And stretches away to the night;   But still I rejoice when the travelers rejoice,   And weep with the strangers that moan, Let me live in my house by the side of the   road,   And be a friend to man.      Let me live in my house by the side of the   road,   Where the race of men go by-   They are good--they are bad--weak and strong,   Wise foolish, so am I.   Then why should I sit in the scorner's seat    Or hurl the cynic's ban?   Let me live in my house by the side of the   road,   And be a friend to man.
