LIFE AND THE SPIRIT    All life must rise to so nothing in the spirit,    Some height of nobleness in deed and thought.    We face the battle not to flee or fear it,    Or be cajoled, or trifled with or bought.    We must be linked with that high spiritual vision    That sees beyond our daily trivial cares    If we would stamp on life with true precision    Our faith that conquers all our brief despairs.    Vaster our energies of high contentions    Against the dragnet of the sundering wrong    If with high-souled and spiritual intention    We save ourselves by helping lift the throng.    â€”Boston Post.
