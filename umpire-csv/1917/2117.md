Prayer   Thy heart to my heart, great King of kings, Throbbing its love and such glad things,   Thou thinking to me, God, as I fain would to   Thee,   Unfolding Thy purpose, Thy love, Thy great   plan,   Thy heritage sure for each child Df man;   Thy infinite patience with slowness and sin, Thus proving Thy power all love to win; Thou, taking my thoughts and transmuting   to gold   Their dross and their alloy, with pity untold; Thou, blending Thy will with mine own   Freely proffered to Thee,   Thus possessed by Thyself, yet royally free;-This then is Prayer, God M all souls,   Such communing with Thee: therefore, 0   Father,   Think Thou to me.Â·   -------A. M. C. Dupree.
