<h1>The Middle Third</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>The Middle Third&quot;None of us have all the good qualities,&quot; says a writer in the St. Joseph Press. ''The unemployed man, over forty-five years old, with a family and a record of steady past employment, has limitations and qualities that correspond. He is a picked and sorted man and valuable, for that reason. His grade is of the average and he comes chiefly from the middle third of the men of his age in respect to ability. The upper third have fought their way through into superior positions for which middle age merely qualities them. The lower third have fallen out of employment long before reaching the gateway of middle life. Those who continue to forty-five before being dropped or promoted into the directory and advisory positions of later life are the most thoroughly and evenly sorted group of men in the country.&quot;</p>
