Sage Leaves      We live amid surfaces, and the true art of life is to glide well on them.   ***   Life in itself is a mixture of power and form, and it will not bear an excess of either.   ***   Everything good is to be found on life's highway, if you look for it.   ***   The middle region of life is to be found in   the temperate zone.   â€¢   All good conversation, and action, come from a spontaneity which overlooks usages, and maks the moment live.   ***   Let us not forget that the vari-colored wheel must revolve very fast to appear white.   ***   Why not treat our neighbors well; as if they were human: perhaps they are.   -The Ranger.
