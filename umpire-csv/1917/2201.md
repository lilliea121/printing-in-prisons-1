Anti-Narcotic Bill Introduced at Harrisburg   A Harrisburg correspondent states that a   sweeping anti-narcotic bill was introduced in the House of Representatives last week by   Samuel A. Whitaker, of Chester County. "Under its terms it becomes a crime for any   person but a druggist, physician or other authorized person to possess a habit-forming   drug and unlawful for any physician to pre- scribe narcotics to patients who seek to be cured of the habit, without filing with the Director of Health, or other local health officer, the name, address and other information concerning the patient, as well as a diag- nosis of each case and the nature and amount of drug prescribed.   ''The act also provides detail forms which   physicians, druggists and others qualified to possess a drug must fill out and place on tile for official inspection at any time. It   makes unlawful the selling, distribution, prescribing or giving away of any habit-forming drug except under the conditions imposed in the bill. Druggists are forbidden to dispense a drug except upon a prescription of a phy- sician, and also are required to obtain from the physician a written order, signed and properly dated, which must be kept for two years, accessible for official inspection at any time. Veterinarians are forbidden the banned drugs for use of a human being.
