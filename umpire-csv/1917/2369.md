THE TALMUD       The Talmud is the compendium of ancient Jewish oral or unwritten law, as distinguished from the Pentateuch, or written law. Its origin is coeval with the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonian captivity, 536 B. C. Its compilation in Hebrew was begun by the scribes, and by their successors the work was carried on till 220 B. C. The Talmud is a combination of prose and poetry and contains two elements, legal and legendary. Its morality resembles that of the New Testament, and its philosophy reminds us very forcibly of that of the great Plato.
