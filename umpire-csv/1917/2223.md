Little Dreadnought on Show   A miniature of the United States dread- nought Pennsylvania, which is on exhibition at one of the department stores, attracted large crowds last week. The model is oper- ated by an automatic electric system and goes through the maneuvers of a warship from the simplest movement to the tiring of the great guns.   The miniature is thirteen feet in length, twenty-four inches wide, has a displacement of 750 pounds, a draft of nine and a half inches and has cl speed of fourteen miles an hour. The inventor, Samuel Orkin, said it took him two and a half years to build the model, at a cost of $15,000. The tiny flagship is built entirely of steel.
