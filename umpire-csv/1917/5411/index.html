<h1>The Knocker</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>THE KNOCKER In speaking of another’s faults, Pray don’t forget your own, Remember, those in homes of glass Should never throw a stone. If you have nothing else to do But knock your fellow-man, ‘Tis better we commence at home And from that place begin. You have no right to judge a man Until we’re right ourselves; Should we not take men’s company, You know this world is wide. We all have faults—and who has not? — The old as well as young! Perhaps we may, for aught we know. Have thousands of our own. I'll tell you of a better plan, And I find it works full well, To try our own defects to cure Before of others’ tell; And though we sometimes hope to be No worse than some we know, My own shortcomings bid me let The faults of others go. Then let us all when we commence To knock our friend or foe, Think of the harm one word may do To those we little know. Remember, knocks sometimes like Your chickens “roost at home,” Don’t knock, or speak of others’ faults [until We have none of our own. (Printed by request.)</p>
