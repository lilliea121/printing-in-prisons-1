Memory of Mother   Farewell, dear mother, sweet thy rest, Weary with years and worn with pain, Farewell till in some happy place   We shall behold thy face again.   We miss thy kind and willing hand, Thy fond and earnest care,   Our home is dark without thee-   W e miss thee everywhere.   Peaceful be thy silent slumber, Peaceful in thy grave so low,   Thou no more will join our number, Thou no more our sorrows know, Yet again we hope to meet thee When the day of life is fled,   And in Heaven with joy to greet thee Where no farewell tears are shed.   -B 2740.
