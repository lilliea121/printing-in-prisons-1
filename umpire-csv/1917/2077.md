The Reward   By John G. Whittier   Who, looking backward from his manhood's prime,   See not the specter of his misspent time? And through the shade   Of funeral cypress, planted thick behind, Hears no reproachful whisper on the wind   From his loved dead?   Who hears no trace of passion's evil force? Who shuns thy sting, 0 terrible remorse?   Who does not cast   On the thronged pages of his memory's   book,   At times, a sad and half reluctant look,   Regretful of the past?   Alas! the evil' which we fain would shun We do, and leave the wished for good ~n-   done;   Our strength today   Is but tomorrow’s weakness, prone to fall; Poor, blind unprofitable servants all   Are we always. '   Yet who, thus looking backward o'er his years, •   Feels not his eyelids wet with grateful tears,   If he hath been   Permitted, weak and sinful as he was,   To cheer and aid in some ennobling cause His fellow men? '   If he hath hidden the outcast, or let in A ray of sunshine to the cell of sin-   If he hath lent   Strength to the weak, and ·in an hour of   need,   Over the suffering, mindless of his creed   Or home, hath bent-   He has not lived in vain. And while he gives   The praise to Him, in whom he moves and lives,   With thankful heart   He gazes backward, and with hope before, Knowing that from his works he never   more   Can henceforth part.
