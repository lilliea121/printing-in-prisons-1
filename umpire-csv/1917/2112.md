A Song of Trust   I can not always see the way that leads To heights above;   I sometimes quite forget that He leads on With hands of love;   But yet I know the path must lead me to Immanuel's land,   And when I reach life's summit I shall know And understand.   I can not always trace the onward course My ship must take,   But, looking backward, I behold afar Its shining wake   Illumined with God's light of love; and so I onward go,   In perfect trust that He who holds the helm The course must know.   I can not always see the plain on which He builds my life;   For oft the sound of hammers, blow on blow, The noise of strife,   Confuse me till I quite forget He knows And oversees,   And that in all details with His good plan My life agrees.   I can not always know and understand The Master's rule;   I can not always do the task He gives   In life's hard school;   But I am learning, with His help, to solve   Them one by one,   And when I can not understand to say,   ''Thy will be done.
