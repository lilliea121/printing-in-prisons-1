Prisoners to Receive Military Training A late dispatch from Salem, Oregon, states that military training will be adopted for the convicts in the Oregon State Penitentiary within a few months, Warden Charles A. Murphy has announced. The prison has a flag within the walls which has been raised for the first time. The convicts stood at attention and the prison band played the “Star-spangled Banner.”
