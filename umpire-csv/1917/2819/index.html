<p>HONOR CLUB NOTES BUSINESS At the weekly meeting of the Board of Delegates of the H. F. C. the principal business was the election of a Secretary in succession to B 8762, forced to resign by pressure of his other duties. We fully appreciate his gallant, but unavailing efforts to accomplish the impossible, that is, to be in two separate and distinct places, at one and the same time., and his resignation was accepted with regret, and a vote of thanks for his efficient services tendered him. He has consented to remain on the Board of Governors of the Club, and his effort to introduce the Taylor “speeding up” system into the work of the Club may yet be successful. B 8266 was unanimously elected his successor. The newly appointed Delegates for the 7th G, B 7471, and 10th B, B 5401 were introduced, and blushingly made their maiden speeches. Apropos of nothing in particular we will here pause to remark that we always admired the violet: it is such a shy, and shrinking bloom. We would heartily recommend it as the Club Flower. Fifteen applications for Membership in the Ciub were passed upon, and accepted, at a total cost of 40¢ in donatives. This figures out at less than three cents per capita, and causes us to point with pride to the purity of our electoral methods. B 7983, the Club’s Watch-Dog of the Treasury, reported a Balance of $78.46, which makes it look like a hard winter for the Club unless some. of our Bead Millionaires will start an Endowment Fund. Expenses during the week were $1.59 to B 6608 for making baseballs; $7.56 to B 7983 for tape for same and $1.00 loaned to B 8177 at the Gate. ENTERTAINMENT The entertainment program on Saturday afternoon was a long, and delightfully varied one; the whistle blowing before it had reached its end, and the boys of the First Section had every reason to be pleased with their half-holiday, there wasn’t a dull minute in it. After some cautionary remarks by the Vice-President, (A 8432,) which we are glad to note, were well heeded, good order being maintained throughout: Professor Wiegandt, and his intrepid band brought the audience to its feet by their fine rendering of the U. S. A. National March, and we proudly assert that not a man in the Hall but would have gone “over the top,” and brought back a section of German trench as a souvenir had he been given the opportunity. We assert without fear of contradiction that we are the most patriotic bunch of would-be warriors in captivity. If Pershing really wants to get to Berlin let him send for us. We are sure there are scores of men here who could find the combination of the German trenches, and if necessary crack the Berlin “box” for Uncle Sam. The picture of the afternoon was a five-reel drama, entitled “The Melting Pot,” a story of Russia under the old regime, and the Jewish persecutions, with the scene shifted to the U. S. in the final reels. It was marked by fine acting, and finer photography, and was very much to the audience’s taste. Hon. J. Mulligan was at the helm of the machine, which, perhaps recognizing its “Master’s voice,” behaved fairly well. Professor Peaks and his blockheads repeated the triumph of the preceding Saturday and were every bit as amusing. We assure the Professor that if to laugh is to grow fat, every one present at his two performances have gained a pound or more through his efforts, and are by so much his debtors. Cleveland &amp; Dillon, juvenile artists, next appeared in a singing and dancing “turn” which was much appreciated by their audience. We wish them every success in their chosen career. “Papa,” the “Veteran of Vaudeville” then delighted his hearers with some clever impersonations, and a gentleman whose name escapes us, appeared in a “rube” costume, and sang some comic songs, winding up with a (cow) bell solo, which reminded some of his hearers very forcibly of the days when they were wont to let down the pasture bars, and call “Bossy” and “Star” etc., home in the twilight. Mr. John Devlin proved himself a “Prince of Entertainers” with his songs and jokes. His talents as a reconteur made him easily the hit of the afternoon, and we extend him our thanks, and a hearty invitation to call again. We wish we had space to retell some of his good stories, but we can at least advise those who weren’t present to call upon those who were for further particulars. Mr. Charles Thompson, of the Keith circuit, then presented a juggling act, which is likely to lead to the ruining of a lot of institution tin-ware in the next few days by would-be imitators. The final act on the program was furnished by a gentleman, sponsored by Miss Russell, whose name we also failed to catch; who with vocal imitations, facial contortions, and banjo interpretations, very acceptably did his “bit.” GENERAL Our attention has been called to the fact that there are many questions being asked regarding the disposition of that portion of the Xmas Fund which was raised the previous Spring; there have been even ugly rumors of late suppers in official circles, and investigations have been hinted at. We will crush these rumors in the bud, by stating that the full sum given, $103.56, was invested, with other monies of the Club, in Liberty Bonds of the first issue, and has been safely drawing interest all the while; and at the proper time, will be used for the purpose for which it was given. The incorruptible integrity of the Club officials is once more vindicated, as well as their business sense, for the Bonds are now selling above par, and take shame to ourselves! but we’ve made money out of our patriotism, for a dollar and two cents now flourishes, where but a dollar grew before. It’s sad, but true. So don’t be afraid to loosen up, boys. The Watch-Dog is on the job, and every penny of your money will go to give some child a Happy Day, and lighten the load of some weary and distressed mother. Next Saturday, November 3, the Second Section will go out as follows: 7 G, 7B, 5 B, 5G, 4B, 4G, 3B. —B 8266.</p>
