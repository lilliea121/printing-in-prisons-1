Woman Offers $5 for a Husband   A Kentucky Miss of twenty, with black eyes and hair and a zest for hard work, has offered the Mayor of Baker, Ore., $5 if he will find her a husband. She wrote that she was so anxious to live in Baker that she would marry any good man in the town and consider her $5 well invested.
