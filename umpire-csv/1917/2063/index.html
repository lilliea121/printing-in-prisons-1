<p>Rock Me to SleepBy Elizabeth Akersn Backward, turn backward, O time in your flightMake me a child again just for tonight! Mother, come back from that echoless shore Take me again to your heart as of yore;Kiss from my forehead the furrow of care Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;-Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep! tBackward, flow backward, oh, tide of theyears!I am so weary of toil and of tears, -Toil without recompense, tears all in vain,-Take them, and give me my childhood again. m1 have grown weary of dust and decay, -Weary of flinging my soul wealth away;Weary of sowing for others to reap; -Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep! Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue, Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you! Many a summer the grass has grown green, Blossomed and faded, our faces between:Yet with strong yearning and passionate painLong I tonight for your presence again.Come from the silence so long and so deep;-Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!Over my heart, in the days that are flown, No love like mother-love ever has shown;No other worship abides and endures, -Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours: None like a mother can charm away pain From the sick soul and world-weary brain. Slumbers soft calms o'er. my heavy lidscreep;Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!Come, let your brown hair; just lighted with gold,Fall on your shoulders again as of old;Let it drop over my forehead tonight,Shading my faint eyes away from the light; For with its sunny-P.dged shadows once moreHappily will throng the sweet visions of yore; Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;-Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!Â·Mother, dear mother, the years have been d longSince I last listened to your lullaby song: Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem a The swift-fleeting years have been only adream.Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,With your light lashes just sweeping-myface,Never hereafter to wake or to weep;-Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep!Printed by special request.</p>
