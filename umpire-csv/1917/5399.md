GOVERNOR BRUMBAUGH DESIGNATES ARBOR DAYS IN APRIL    Making a plea for reforestation of Pennsylvania, Governor Brumbaugh urges that children of the state be instructed as to the meaning and value of trees in his annual Arbor Day proclamation, in which he says:       “Whereas, Pennsylvania was once the home of vast forests of deciduous and evergreen trees, whose value to our people can never be fully reckoned; and,       “Whereas, Our people now have set aside more than 1,200,000 acres of land as a state forest preserve and are steadily adding to this vast public domain and are giving increased attention to the conservation of her depleted natural resources and are making commendable efforts to restore, as far as possible, these gifts of God to our people;       “Now, therefore, that we may wisely promote in the minds and hearts of our people a knowledge and love for trees and in order that the generations to follow may enjoy the blessings of forests and the good of trees, I hereby designate and set aside Friday, April 13, and Friday, April 27, 1917, as arbor days.
