Going the Rounds   My, but time does fly! Ten days of the new year licked off already.      Another year before the "dutch cakes" are passed around. They sure were good this time.      The printers are enjoying their holiday pie-I mean the Annual Report.      Strange sounds are to be heard on a certain   block, apparently coming from cell 17 at the   early hours of the morning. As near as we   can make out, the cry is "I-want-to-go-home.,,   The night guards are trying to figure out what became of K's 70--70 doll-a-r-s.   $   The new tuba recently presented to the E.S.P. band has completely hypnotized one of the members. He follows it around wherever it goes.   Good weather continuing, the mason gang will be able to make a fine showing with the work in hand.      The state legislature has adjourned until January 22, but t h e new bills, in the interest of prison reform, are safely put away in cold storage and will keep indefinitely. Why worry?
