A Letter of Appreciation   McSHERRYSTOWN, PA.,   February 22nd, 1917. To the Honor & Friendship Members:   I certainly will write a few words, thanking you very, very much for your kindness, I'm sure.   Children are very well pleased with cloth, and everything was fine and dainty.   Also hear you boys have sent me ten dollars, which is a great help to me.   Your kindness is highly appreciated, as I'm very much in need.   Hoping you not to forget us in future. Many, many thanks also from little ones.   Yours,
