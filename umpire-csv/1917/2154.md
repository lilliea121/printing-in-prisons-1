WILLIAM T. BISHOP   We regret to record the passing away of William T. Bishop, who has been an overseer at this institution for the past fifteen years His death occurred at his home on North Wilton Street, this city. Overseer Bishop was the son of the late Major John S. Bishop and during the Spanish-American war he enlisted and served as lieutenant in a New Jersey regiment. Going to the Philippines his health failed, and he was forced to resign for that reason. He leaves a wife and three children to mourn his loss We extend our sincere sympathy to the bereaved family.
