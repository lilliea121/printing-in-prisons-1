The Stars and Stripes Forever   A clever piece of electrical work was on exhibition at the intersection of the 2nd, 10th and 11th blocks at this institution on Washington's birthday. It consisted of an arrangement of colored electric lights formed to represent the Stars and Stripes, with an appearance of wave motion to the flag. It was an ingenious contrivance to say the least, and reflects credit on the men of the Electric Department.   B 6652 designed and built the flash mechanism.
