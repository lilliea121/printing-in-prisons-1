How to Wish   Do you wish the world were better"? Let me tell you what to do;   Set a watch upon your actions,   Keep them always straight and true. Rid yourself of selfish motives,   Let your thoughts be clean and high, You can make a little Eden   Of the sphere you occupy.   Do you wish the world was wiser?   Well, suppose you make a start, By accumulating wisdom   In the scrapbook of your heart. Do not waste one page on folly,   Live and learn, and learn to live. If you want to give men knowledge,   You must get it ere you give.   Do you wish the world were happy?   Then remember day by day Just to scatter seeds of kindness As you pass along the way;   For the pleasures of the many May be ofttimes traced to 'one. As the hand that plants an acorn   Shelters armies from the sun.   -Selected.
