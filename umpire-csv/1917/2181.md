Brings to Light $35,000 in Jewels from “Coon Hole”   Jewelry worth $35,000 was found in a ''coon hole" on a California ranch by a trapper, Alfred Talbot, as he was setting a trap. The jewels included watches of a pattern in vogue twenty-five years ago. The stuff was in cans red with rust, and is believed to have been cached by thieves.
