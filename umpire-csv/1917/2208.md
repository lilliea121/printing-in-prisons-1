Only   Only a little tiny spark, Falling so softly down;   In one short hour a frightful glare Shall rouse the sleeping town.   Only a little spiteful word, A scarcely noted sneer,   Finding a sunny, joyous heart, Leaving behind-a tear.   -Only a careless, mocking smile, A foolish, ill-timed jest;   It quenched the dawning of a love, Too weak to bear the test.   Only the shadow of a doubt, The whisper of a friend;   It sent two lives to grieve apart, Mistaken to the end.   Only a little broken toy, Shabby and old and torn,   It woke the memory of a loss Too heavy to be borne.   Only the little daily wants Left at the gate of prayer,   Taking instead the Â·golden spoil, Won from the Master there.   -Selected.
