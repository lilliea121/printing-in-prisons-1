BILL IN SENATE FOR STATE MILITARY TRAINING    It is announced that the State Senate took the first step toward the establishment of a system of military training in Pennsylvania when, by a unanimous vote, it passed a resolution introduced by Senator Charles H. Snyder, of Schuylkill, providing for the appointment of a legislative committee to prepare and draft a military training code for introduction into the present session of the General Assembly.       The resolution, as explained by Senator Snyder in an address to the chamber, is intended to give the Legislature the advantage of all expert knowledge and opinion as to methods of military training before committing itself to any particular system. It is expected that the committee provided for in the resolution will hold hearings on the question before drafting the measure. The resolution, having passed the Senate, goes to the House for concurrence. Some opposition is expected there.
