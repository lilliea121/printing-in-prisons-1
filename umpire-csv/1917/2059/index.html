<p>Every-Day SayingsCharacter talks when we are silent.***The more degraded a man is the more heis hurt by our contempt.A physical element should enter into all affection. Even to clasp hands should always be a pleasure.In friendship, as in work and in play, give and take is the great source of novelty.*** **Seriousness simon-pure is a residentialstate into which one relapses when one has nothing-better to do or say.Your best friend strikes thoughts and deeds out of you that you never knew were in you,and that truly were not full formed in you till your friend woke them to life.Everybody wants to be understood by somebody; but in the natural course of events everybody is more or less misunderstood or distortedly understood by most of his friends and acquaintances.***Baseball, dancing, and the drama are theonly popular arts of America today. Let us realize that they are nevertheless genuine arts, and plant them close beside music, painting, sculpture, and literature.</p>
