<h1>Conditions</h1>

<p>ConditionsEvery one worth calculating on will concede the fact that a prison is not the best place on earth to be in, but few people will concede that they brought about their im- prisonment. The greater a man's pleasure on the outside, the harder becomes his con- finement, as deprivation of his own personal pleasure is his real cause for worriment. Some men may say, &quot;I wouldn't care if it s were not for my wife, or my mother, or my a children,&quot; or some other convenient person to pass the responsibility to. The fact is, it is himself who occupies every thought. Give him the credit of believing different, but it is nevertheless is true.The fact is, the average person is enjoying as near a perfect condition as is possible to conceive while here in this particular prison. The sooner these subjects are discussed and drilled into some men's minds, the better it t will be for them; and the sooner we all begin to realize that we are put here for something that we have done against the State, the sooner we will give thanks for the humane treatment we receive at the hands of the a people who have us in charge. Why, some fellows talk around as though we were put h here and kept here by the officials, when the s fact is that they would move heaven and earth to set us free; some because they de- serve it, and others because of a good riddance. Do you ever stop to think of the kind treatment we receive here and what happens in other places of this kind around the world? No, you do not or you would all rise as a man and show by your every move that you had nothing but the kindest of thoughts for those that are in every way try- ing to help and better the conditions of the men here in this place. Keep it in mind, brothers, and remember that the officials did not send you out to steal, lie, rob, and com- mit rape, and also the various other offenses that we are doing our &quot;bit&quot; here for. No; as I have said before, we have only ourselves to blame, and the only real excuse we can offer is that &quot;we did not think we would get caught.'' Every paper we read on the out- side has an account of some one being sent to prison, and if you look them over carefully you will see that the crimes we were all sent here for would fit in some one of them. But no, that was not warning enough. We just dived in, and now, as you read this, admitthe truth. It did not stop you, did it? And why? Because you thought that you would not get caught. We think that it is hard here. Well, it is not, as compared with what it could be; but the fellow that always has a grumble with him just gets a fellow to think- ing that it is fierce; but if instead of worrying, you would just stand aside and look this knocker over, you would see a fellow (no matter what your experience may have been in the judging of human nature) that you would probably not trust to shine your shoes outside. But you let him work you into a passion, and the first thing you know you are just like him. Certainly in a crowd of men such as we have gathered here we must expect defects, but that is no sign that you o have to lower yourself to his level and be- come like him. You have no excuse as our a friend, the Warden, will move you until you can get with some one you know is up to your own standard, and gradually these troublemakers and grumblers will be all by themselves, and through shame they will swing about and do right. Why can't we have perfect harmony in a place like this, where we are all on the same level? Just think how much nicer it would  be to sail along with a smile on your face. to Be game. You owe the State a debt; pay it; make it easy for yourself. You know how most all of you act when you attend church on Sunday mornings, and the thoughts that recalled your younger days. When you leave a the chapel, do not leave them behind, but  carry them with you to your cell and keep them throughout the week. See how the time flies. I know of a man who has a good job in here and is out all the time, but still he can't get enough to eat. His paddle shows that he w has gained something like twenty pounds since coming here, and just the other day he stood and boasted that his father raised a family of six on sixty-five cents a day. Think a of what a remarkable man he was. But of course the prices of food were not as high as now. Still this man, knowing this, is not a satisfied; and through later years he himself raised his own family of six on one dollar and a half a day. Ask why some of them stole and they will tell you they had to in order to live. And when they were arrested, what did they have? Nothing. For their re- ward they get sentenced to this place where they can leave with a good job in view, as there is a chance to learn different kinds of trades that will fit them for the outside world's battles.You say you stole to live. Then when you get in here, where your living is free, you kick; so how can you be satisfied? Take the food prices in New York today: meat, twenty-four cents a pound; onions, twenty cents a pound; potatoes, seven cents a pound; cab- bage, twenty cents a pound; butter, fifty-six cents a pound; bread, seven cents a loaf. Take the item of bread. Do you stop to thinkof whom you are fooling when you take in more than you know you will eat? I'll an- swer it for you. We are just fooling our- selves; and I know, and you know, that we could save fifty percent of it. You ask why? Well, I'll tell you. Save on your bread, and we will have it made up on other things.Some talk about our soup when it is not soup. Think of the prisoners of war that are not getting half what we are having; and they got in prison for what? For taking a chance of trying to get killed. And we are in here for taking what did not belong to us, whether it was money or somebody's right eye, and then we are not satisfied. On the above food figures, it is easily calculated by this state- ment, that if you bought one pound of each of these foods a day, not to say coffee at forty cents a pound, sugar at twelve cents a pound, and milk at ten cents a quart; then provided fire with coal at seven and a half dollars a ton to cook your meals with, it would not re- quire a prohibition bill to prevent a man from going on a drunk often, especially when he had to pay rent and buy clothes for himself and family on two dollars a day.Now, if you are thoughtful men, what must you think when, knowing these conditions, you hear a knocker say we don't get enough to eat? And still your pans are filled to the top, and we are having riots and shooting scrapes outside by people battling for food. No, boys, you are all wrong, and it is safe to say that nine out of every ten of you in here are better off than you were outside. If you would just pass up the stories of how you are going to get pardoned, and all the things that other people are going to do for you when you get out, and just pin yourselves down to the fact that you are here and going to stay until your time is up, you will find that you will pass the time lots easier. Then, if your chance comes, that you are to get a pardon, you will be in a better condition to go out and battle the world, having saved all your strength and built up within yourselves the right thoughts.Remember the conditions in prison are ex- actly what you make them. Be game; be a sport. You played the game and lost. Now start and figure out how to play it so you won't lose, and you will find that in your figures that they say play fair. Live up to your ten commandments, and I'll bet that they can't land you in jail with all the 50-centimeter guns from the German army. B 8261.</p>
