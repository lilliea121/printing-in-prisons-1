Work The Key to Success   One day last 'October was observed as "Edison Day" at the Electrical Exposition in New York City. Thirty-five years previous to that the great electrician announced the invention of the incandescent light, which has practically revolutionized the lighting appliances of the entire civilized world. While Mr. Edison is doubtless one of the foremost inventors in the world, and many ascribe his wonderful achievements to his great genius, he personally credits it largely to his never, ceasing hard work. He puts it in these words: "The question of natural aptitude enters into the matter, and without it no man can become a star." Continued perseverance is the key to success. ''In the workshop of   science, the man who keeps at one thing, and never minds the clock, is . always sure to do something." What Mr. Edison has so well stated in the words quoted, may be applied, most admirably, to the various activities of the spiritual realm. It is the worker who, by persistent endeavor, seeks to accomplish the task before him, that is sure to reach the goal and to win the prize. The ''Well done" of the Master is earned only by never-   flagging tail in the great world field.
