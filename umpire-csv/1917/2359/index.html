<p>BALL GAMES OF THE WEEK Tuesday’s Game Cubs vs. Athletics The postponed game between the Cubs and Athletics was played on Tuesday at the Storehouse grounds, and proved a walk-over for the Cubs, as they rolled up a final score of 9—1. Boyd opened in the box for the Cubs but retired in the fifth inning, owing to too many walks, and he was replaced by Banks, who finished the game. Stony’s ambition was good, but his pitching arm wasn’t with him, and his curves were easily found by his opponents. Athletics........ 001000000-1 0 0 (Cubs ete te 103320000—9 10.0 Two-base hits, Cubs 3. Struck out by Boyd, 7; by Stony, 5. Umpires—Jimmie and Ty Cobb. Owing to lack of space we are unable to give particulars of Ninth vs. Athletics on Monday last. The score was Ninth 2, Athletics 1. Wednesday’s Games Cubs vs. Printers Wednesday’s game at the Storehouse grounds between the Cubs and Printers, proved disastrous for the latter owing in part to their lack of “pep” and to their opponents bunching their hits. The game was interesting until the fourth round when the Cubs’ players solved Hagy’s curves and made five runs. Boyd pitched in good form for the Cubs and seemed to have the ball under good control, striking out nine and walking but one, with only three hits. Two base hits, Printers 3; Cubs 1. Struck out by Boyd 9, by Hagy 12. Home run—Jordan. Umpires—Rabbie and Ty Cobb. Ninth vs. Athletics A one-sided game was played at the Garage grounds between the Ninth and the Athletics, owing to the inability of the latter’s players to solve Jacoby’s curves, and to weak playing. Charlie’s work in the box for the Athletics did not prove effective, and D. C. was substituted in the fifth inning, but was not equal to the occasion, being found for three hits. Jacoby’s pitching for the Ninth was very effective, as he held his opponents down to two hits, striking out twelve.Struck out by Jacoby 12; Charley 6. Umpires—Jimmie and Barrington. Friday’s Games Cubs vs. Printers The Printers again proved their strength at the game played at the Storehouse grounds on Friday, Mooney pitching in good form, and he was well supported by his team-mates at critical stages of the game. Harvey opened in the box for the Cubs, but was taken out and replaced by Boyd, who finished the game. The two runs made in the first inning by the Printers led on to victory by a score of 4—2 at the final. Several brilliant plays were made by both sides and the game was interesting from start to finish. Boyd’s pitching was somewhat uneven at times, but he held his opponents down to four hits. Jordan’s three-base hit featured. Printers....2 0101000 0—4 4 0 ‘Gubst01100000 0—2 6 0 Two base hits, Printers 1, Cubs 1. Three base hits, Jordan. Struck out by Mooney 9, by Boyd 5. Umpires—Rabbie and Ty Cobb. (pg. 4)THE UMPIRE E.

Mack’s pitching was not up to his usual standard and had his opponents lost heart at the break in the fourth inning, the result might have been different. It is evident that the Athletics need to “buck up’? and work together to get out of their present rut. Two base hits, Athletics 3. Struck out by Mack 6, by Stony 11. Umpires— Happy and Jimmie. Monday’s Game Printers vs. Cubs It was an interesting game that was played at the Storehouse grounds on Monday, between the Printers and Cubs, as each team seemed determined to roll up a decisive score for their side. The fans voiced their delight by vigorous applause as spectacular plays were made, and there was an absence of the annoying “rooting” that develops at some games. Hagy was in the box for the Printers and pitched an even game, striking out twelve, no walks, and allowed but five hits. The game abounded in exciting plays as it progressed and there was loud applause as Chick and Silly each made a homerun. Boyd pitched for the Cubs, with good control of the ball.</p>
