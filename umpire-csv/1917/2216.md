Honor Club Notes   The disappointment was general among the 1st Section on Saturday when it was made known that the entertainment could not be held.   Owing to misunderstanding, the Vice-Pres- ident (A 8432) gave the notice on February 10th that the entertainment would be held as usual, but afterwards conditions arose that forced the Vice-President to notify the delegates that "the show was off." This he did with regret, and no fault of his own, and he guarantees that, all things equal, the entertainment of February 24th will be equal to anything yet given. Therefore, let the disappointment be a boost, and the enjoyment will be the greater. Miss Mae Russell and Mr. Kraupa, with Herbert, and Jimmy Mulligan ("the man in the box") will be re- freshed for their holiday and returning bring a show that will produce an applause that will make those sixteen-inch guns sound like a firecracker.   The 1st Section, February 24th-3 B, 5 B, 5 G, 4 B, 4 G, 7 B, 7 G.   -B 7542.
