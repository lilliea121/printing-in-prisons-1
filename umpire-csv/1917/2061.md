CUT IT OUT!   If you have a grouch that pains you, Cut it out;   Or a habit that enchains you, Cut it out ..   Don't waste time in useless thinking; .You can't cure yourself by winking. So, just can the foolish shrinking-   Cut it out.   If you're fond of sorrows telling, Cut it out;   E]re you hear the chorus swelling: "Cut it out!"   Folks are bored by all this goating And this grief-charged anecdoting; If you want to keep a-floating,   Cut it out.
