Choosing Upward   It is pretty certain that "all the beauty and wonder of life lies in the choice we make, and the tragedy too," says a writer in Nautilus.   "Every moment of our lives some choice confronts us, and we are called upon to use our judgment, our experience, our faith, our self-confidence, in making our decision.   ''Going through life is like traveling down a long corridor , which constantly presents closed doors on either side-alternate doors--one of which we must open and pass through, irrevocably. We can not make use of both doors, nor can we retrace our steps, nor even reconsider our choice, once the latch has been lifted. We must abide by our decision. There are no exchanges. We must do our considering before we choose, not after . And the choice once made, whether for good or ill, for better or worse, we must pay the full price.   This well expressed by an old Persian proverb: “Take what you will,' said the gods to the mortals, 'but pay for it.'” This world is like a great balance-sheet, and the man has not been born who has found a way to tamper with the totals or to get around God. Life holds us inexorably to our ac- counting, and carries out the final reckoning to the uttermost farthing.
