A Cargo Hard to Handle   Asphalt is said to be the most difficult cargo for a vessel to unload. The asphalt is taken out of the asphalt lakes in Trinidad in a semi-fluid state, and by the time the vessel reaches   a northern port has hardened so that to unload it, it is necessary for the men to go into the hold and dig it out with pick and shovel. This takes time, and a vessel carrying such cargo al ways has to arrange for a considerable stay in port.
