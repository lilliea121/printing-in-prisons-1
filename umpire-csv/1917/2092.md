Destinies of Life    Know well, my soul, God's hand controls Whate'er thou fearest,   Round Him in calmest music rolls Whate'er thou hearest.   Man sees no future -a phantom show Is alone before him;   Past time is dead, and the grasses grow, And flowers bloom o'er him.   The present, the present, is all thou hast For thy sure possessing;   Like the patriarch's angel, hold it fast Till it gives its blessing.   Like warp and woof, all destinies Are woven fast,   Linked in sympathy like the keys -Of an organ vast.   Pluck one thread, and the web ye mar; Break but one   Of a thousand keys, and paining jar Through all will run.   And in life, in death, in dark, and light, All are in God's care;   Sound the black abyss, pierce the deep of night,   And He is there.   -John Greenleaf Whittier.
