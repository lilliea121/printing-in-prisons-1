An Odd Gas Burner    From a writer in the Popular Science Monthly we learn that a woman's thimble suggested the first gas burner. "William Murdock, the inventor, first burned the gas as it came from the end of a pipe. One day he wished to stop the illumination quickly. Looking around "for an extinguisher, he seized his wife's thimble and thrust if over the light, which immediately went out.   "There was a strong odor of gas, however, and Murdock, seeing that the end of the thimble was full of tiny holes, touched a light to it. Through all the holes jets of flame appeared, and the experimenter was surprised to find that the illumination from those tiny jets was greater than that given by the flare from the end of the pipe. Acting on the principle that this chance discovery revealed, Murdock made what was known as the 'cockspur burner.â€™"
