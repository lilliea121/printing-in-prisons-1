<p>Washington’s AnniversaryIf we reread the various addresses of Wash- ington, ''in order to envisage 'the man we celebrate' on these recurrent memorial occa- sions, it is to regain an inspiration that is simply overpowering in the matter of a cer- tain supreme optimistic outlook, wider hori- zons, broader hopes and a serene confidence that 'the experiment' which he and his great compeers were then essaying would not come to naught,&quot; says an editorial writer in the Public Ledger.&quot;Believing that. 'the destiny of the republi- can model,' the world over, was 'deeply and finally staked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the American people,' a senti- ment which was a feature of his First In- augural of April 30th, 1789, eight years later he rejoiced in his Eighth Annual and final ad- dress to be able to assure Congress, on De- cember 7th, 1796, that the experiment had succeeded, and he then uttered his last public but far from despairing supplication that the government 'might be perpetual.'''This last annual address actually came after the famous 'Farewell,' which was given out on September 17th, 1796, and which as Washington's last political will and testament to his beloved people still remains one of the supreme rallying points of patriotism, and equally supreme bit of literature. It is full of the ever familiar sonorities of a rhetoric that is - never trivial, and, coming from a mind that could never be petty, it ranks with the Shakespearean dramas as a memoried ut- terance, and shares with them in the affec- tions of the people that good-natured cr.iti- cism of pleased surprise of the gallery that'the language is wonderful, since it is en- tirely made up of famous quotations.' Al- most every sentence of the 'Farewell Ad- dress' has become a household phrase, even though the source is not always recognized. And while in the 'Farewell Address' we get the principles of government and national life expounded, it was in the much more prac- tical 'annuals' that the sensible, hardworking executive, anxious to make the experi-  ment a working success, is revealed. This he never more surely revealed than in his ideas looking to the promotion of a strong central government, the creation of sound fi- nance, the protection and promotion of our own industries, in order to make us industrially independent of Europe, and, above all to the securing of an educational, physical and military state of preparedness that would mean the integrity of our boundaries at home and respect for the country abroad. Indeed, the famous phrases dealing with this phase of things, which belong to the Fifth Annual, were but a restatement of the thought of the First Annual of January 8th, 1790, wherein he said, 'To be prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace.'&quot;There is a rank due the United States among nations which will be withheld if not absolutely lost by the reputation of weak- ness. If we desire to avoid insult we must be able to repel it; if we desire to secure peace it must be known that we are at all times ready for war.&quot;(From Washington's Fifth Annual Address, December 3rd, 1793.)</p>
