CHORAL SONG SERVICE OF UNUSUAL MERIT    The ladies of San Domingo Choral gave an exceptionally fine concert at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, under the masterly direction of Dr. Joseph P. Burns, with Miss Loreto McCann as accompanist.       The program, consisting of several numbers of popular music, was rendered in a most artistic and pleasing manner, which appealed to the assembled guests in a way that brought out repeated encores.       Thanks are due the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners for their efforts in behalf of the E. S. P. inmates, and under whose auspices the concert was made possible. The selections were as follows:       PROGRAM    1. The Mariners Randegger    2. Song at Sunrise Manney    3. Dance Song Von Weinzierl    4. The Palms Faure    5. Absent Metcalf-Lynes    6. The Two Marionettes Cooke   7. Swing Song Lohr    8. Dutch Dolls Ostlere    Dr. Joseph P. Burns, Director. Miss Loreto McCann, Accompanist.
