Government Alarmed Over Lack of Recruits   Postmasters Ordered to Cooperate In Securing 50,000 More Men   It is announced by a Washington corre- spondent that active steps "are being taken by the War Department to stimulate recruit- ing to the point necessary to bring the enlisted strength of the army to the full numerical measure authorized by existing legislation, including the defense act of June 3rd 1916 which authorized the enlargement of the army in annual increments for the next five years.   Large batches of circulars "have been sent to 50,000 postmasters, as a result of which, according to information reaching the War Department, also made public today a circular letter prepared and issued by direction of the adjutant-general of the army, which is being   sent to all patriotic societies and associa- tions as well as to individual citizens in con- nection with offers for service that have been received by the War Department in large numbers recently ."
