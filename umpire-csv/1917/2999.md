Miss Mae Russell, eager to help all, sug- gested to all that the Bennie Franklin Tots be permitted to give their dancing act to the female contingent of the institution. Ward- en McKenty freely gave permission, and the Bennie Franklin Tots, the mother who ac- companies at all their performances consent- ing, went to the Second Block and enter- tained with their full act. Of course the "wee small mite" made the hit, and many who saw her clever impersonation felt the desire to mother the little dear. The ap- plause came rolling up the Second Block, in- dicating the appreciation for Miss Mae Rus- sell, the Tots, and Mrs. Bennie Franklin.
