THE GOLDEN SIDE    There’s many a rest in the road of life    If we only would stop to take it,    And many a tone from the better land    If the querulous heart would make it.    To the sunny soul that is full of hope,    And whose beautiful trust ne’er faileth,    The grass is green and the flowers are bright,    Though the wintry storm prevaileth.       Better to hope, though the clouds hang low   And to keep the eyes still lifted,    For the sweet blue sky will soon peep through,    When the ominous clouds are rifted.    There’s never a night without a day,    Nor an evening without a morning,    And the darkest hour, as the proverb goes,    Is the hour before the dawning.       There’s many a gem in the path of life,    Which we pass in our idle pleasure,    That is richer far than the jeweled crown,    Or the miser’s hoarded treasure;    It may be the love of a little child,    Or a mother’s prayer to heaven,    Or only a beggar’s grateful thanks    For a cup of water given.       Better to weave in the web of life    A bright and golden filling,    And do G d’s will with a cheerful heart,    And hands that are swift and willing,    Than to snap the delicate, tender threads    Of our curious lives asunder,    And then blame Heaven for the tangled ends,    And sit and grieve and wonder.     —Author Unknown.
