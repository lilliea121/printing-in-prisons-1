Song Service by Inmate Choir at E.S.P.    The inmate choir, assisted by E. S. P. orchestra, gave a fine song service on the Center, at this institution on Sunday afternoon last, under the able direction of Professor A. F. Wiegandt.   The program consisted of a number of popular and melodious sacred songs and several tuneful orchestral pieces well calculated to please those in attendance and the inmate population.   Chaplain Joseph Welch's short address to the men completed a most pleasurable afternoon of entertainment.   1.   2. 3.   4. 5.   6.   *** PROGRAM   Baracarole From Tales of Hoffman Offenbach   Hymn No. 131 (R.
