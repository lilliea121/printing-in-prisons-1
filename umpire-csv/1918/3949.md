CROPS IN GERMANY HUGE, EXPERT SAYS    London, Nov. 25.—The Cologne Gazette of November 16 published an article under the heading, “Armistice and the Food Supply,” written by a specialist, Herr Oetelshofen, who argued that there could be no question of a shortage of food in Germany, but that it was urgently necessary to reduce rations.       The writer maintained that Germany could deal with the transport problem by re-adjustments, reducing the transport of potatoes and vegetables and confining the transport facilities to foods of greater nutritive value in proportion to their bulk. He advocated the killing of pigs in particular, the abolition of the’ rationing of sugar and the restriction of railway consignments to distances of more than 150 miles to consignments of corn, sugar, live cattle, meat, fats, poultry, eggs and cheese.       Dealing with the harvest. Herr Oetelshofen estimated the bread-corn harvest apart from barley and oats, at not less than 12,000,000 tons and the potato harvest at about 47,500,000 tons.
