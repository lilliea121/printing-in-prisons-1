HITS OR FOULS    If all chickens should come home to roost at once, we imagine who would experience some little difficulty in providing sleeping quarters for theirs.       Johnny-”How long can a man live without brains?”    Jerry-”I don’t know. How old are you, anyway?’       A man is judged by the company he keeps, and not by the company he butts into.       The Sergeant was calling the Roll of the newest Awkward Squad. “What’s your name?” he barked at the first victim.    “FOX.”    “And yours?” to the second.    “Baer.”    “And you?”    “Campbell.”    “Well?” furiously,    “Wolf.” deprecatingly.    “Get a cage, get a cage,” yelled the Sergeant, “we’ve gotta blooming menagerie on our hands.”
