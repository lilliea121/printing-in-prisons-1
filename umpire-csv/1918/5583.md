Final arrangements for the opening of an American Jewish Congress next Sunday, the first of its kind in the history of the Jews in this country, are made by the Hebrew Literature Society. Six hundred delegates will be present at the sessions in the LuLu Temple. The purposes of the Jewish Congress is to define methods whereby full rights may be secured for the Jews in all lands, and all laws discriminating against them abrogated.       The most interesting features in every city in Germany today is the new status of the common soldier. He may frequently be seen riding in automobiles while officers walk. He never salutes his former superiors anymore and the sudden reversion of affairs is taking on quite a comical tint.
