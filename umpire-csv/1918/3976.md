THE HEART OF AN IRISH LAD    The minstrel boy to the war has gone,    In the ranks of death you’ll find him;    His father’s sword he has girded on,    And his wild harp slung behind him.    “Land of Song” said the warrior bard,    “Though all the world betrays thee;    One word, at least, thy rights shall guard,    One faithful harp shall praise thee.”       The minstrel fell, but the foeman’s chains    Could not bring his proud soul under;    The harp he loved ne’er spoke again,    For he tore its chords asunder;    And said! “No chains shall sully thee,    Thou soul of love and bravery!    Thy songs were made for the pure and free,    They shall never sound in slavery!”
