STATE PRISONERS CAN’T WORK For UNITED STATES    HARRISBURG, OCT. 30. Inmates of the penitentiaries and prisons of Pennsylvania cannot be legally employed in the manufacture of supplies or munitions for the United States Government because the recent Act establishing the Prison Labor Commission and regulating employment of prisoners provides that they may manufacture only for the State the counties or public institutions, according to an opinion given today by Attorney General Brown to Eastern Penitentiary authorities. Mr. Brown, however, says that while the employment of such prisoners on Government work is at present restricted “it may be assumed that the Legislature which will convene for its biennial session within a few months will take cognizance of the exigencies provided by the participation of our country in the world war and will provide such temporary changes in our laws in this matter and all others which will place at the disposal of the Federal Government the full and unrestricted resources of the State, including the inmates of our prisons, who 1 am informed, desire to aid their fellows on the outside to win the war.”
