“To love God with all the heart, and our neighbor as ourselves, is the whole of religion.”      [Column 2]   Demobilization of American forces is being arranged for. Development battalions, numbering some 98.000 men will be first discharged; next, all conscientious objectors who are not serving sentences; then the spruce production division; fourth, men in training for officers; fifth, the United States Guards, some 135.000 men; sixth, railway troops; seventh; the depot brigades; eight, replacement camps; ninth and last, combat divisions. There are 1.770.000 in United States camps to be discharged, and it is hoped to discharge 200.000 in the next two weeks, and then proceed releasing them at the rate of 30.000 a day.
