<h1>If You Want to Sleep Well</h1>

<p>IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP WELL Don’t carry your troubles to bed with you. Don’t enter into a discussion or become excited over any matter just before retiring, if you would have restful, needed slumber. Discharge these disquieting thoughts ’till broad daylight. It will then be possible for you to do clearer thinking and more to the point. At night your system should be relaxed to gain strength for the following day and worry then leads to morbid thought. When you find your mind racing madly and you cannot seem to stop it, get up and into a chair. Often the change of physical position will help to gain control of the runaway thoughts which trouble you. It is far better to remain out of bed than to roll and toss about, till you get yourself completely out of whack because sleep won’t come. Sleeplessness is often prolonged from the too great effort to overcome it. To use your time after bed hour going over annoyances is antagonizing the little sleep God “Morpheus” and he will get even every time. Hold some happy restful thoughts or sentiment when you close your eyes at night and see if you are not able to solve your problems easier next day.</p>
