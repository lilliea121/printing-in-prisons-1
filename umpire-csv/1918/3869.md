GERMANY SIGNS AND WE WRITE FREE VERSE    We write this to the music    —Glad, great, glorious music—    Of ten thousand whistles,    Crying “Victory!” thru the night;    And we’re wonderfully happy,    That it’s all over,    Over there.    We win,    And the boys will be coming back;    And we’re magnificently sad,    That we didn’t get in it;    And our tears persist    In gathering on our nose,    Instead of running down our cheeks,    As they should do,    And we want to yell    Like a three-year old;    And our dignity won’t let us,    So we’re simply in a ______ of a fix,    But we’re better off than Germany,    She’s licked!    We may be here for a good ten years;    And—    We may be here for longer;    Or we may go out,    Via the Seventh Block corner;    Whatever happens,    We don’t care!    For we’re free.    Free of the menace of the Hun.    Free of all the years to come:    Fear of the dread and fear of Kings,    And Kaisers.    And we know this,    That never again,    Will we have so glad a waking;    Because we won’t have to whip Germany    Twice in a lifetime;    She’ll stay licked!    B 8266
