PEACE    He’s crying for peace, the yellow cur,    With his legions in cowardly flight,    He’s begging the chance he never gave France    When he struck like a thief at night.    But he didn’t cry peace four years ago    As he murdered a cringing child—    When Belgium’s death was the Hun’s life breath,     And his bloody hordes ran wild.    He’s begging to save his tarnished crown    And his vandal sons as well.    With his heart of stone he craves the throne    Of a race matured in hell.    But he didn’t mind thrones four years ago    As he slaughtered babes at play.    When with beastly stroke the world’s war broke    And his clans acclaimed “The Day.”    So he’ll get the peace that he deserves    And mercy’s a missing ban.    When his blinded slaves are in’ trench-like graves.    And we’ve crushed his filthy clan.    When we’ve rid the world of a cancerous sore    And banished the golden fleece—    When the last Hun’s gone, and there’s clean pure dawn—    We’ll grant the Kaiser peace.    —JOHN R. ROBINSON,    19th Co., C. O. T. S., Camp Gordon, Ga.
