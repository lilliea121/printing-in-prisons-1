IMPRACTICAL ADVICE    When You arrive in the morning, walk around and ask everyone regarding their health; that’s polite and will greatly strengthen the friendship and sharpen the mind for the day’s labor.       Always Talk Loud so that everyone can hear you. Those that do not work like to hear you, and those who do work like to have something to swear over and put the blame on if they make mistakes.       If You See anyone working, go and ask him any old question, preferably something he doesn’t know. Everyone likes to be considered an authority on things that he knows nothing about, and you may get unprejudiced advice.      Always Use cuss words when you have a chance. It gives importance to what you say and the boys may learn some “new ones.”       When You Here a new story, tell it to everyone. There is nothing like a good story to kill time and refresh the mind.       If You See two talking, always “butt in” and ask some questions. They might just as well do two things at the same time. If they have any brains, it will be good mental exercise; if they have none, it’s “allee samee.”      THE CORRECTOR
