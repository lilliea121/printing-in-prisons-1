ELUSIVE HAPPINESS    We must remember one thing. It is not absolutely necessary to be happy. It is all very well to talk about happiness, but one of the strangest contradictions of life is that we can never find happiness, if we search for it. Happiness is elusive. It will escape us, if we seek to hold it. But if we go our way, if we refuse to lose our faith, no matter how sad we may be, no matter how weary or how disheartened, we will learn to find happiness in little things, in the reading of a book, in the singing of a song, in the making of a dress, in the doing of our work.       It is the last thing indeed that is the real cure for the disillusionment of life that comes to each of us. Work is the great panacea.       If we work, and work well, we shall find much to compensate us. And if along the way we choose to pretend that dreams do sometimes come true, who can blame us?
