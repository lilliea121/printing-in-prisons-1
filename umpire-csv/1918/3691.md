To the Officers and Members of the Honor and Friendship Club,   Gentlemen:-   I beg to advise you that upon the interment of one of your members who died August 4, the plot of ground purchased by the late John J. Bradley for the burial of Club members in Blockley Baptist Cemetery has been closed.   Before purchasing more ground in the same Cemetery we wish to present for your approval the wishes of the said Mr. Bradley who if he had lived intended to acquaint you with the facts personally, to wit;   In the future for all interments made by us we are compelled due to the ever increasing cost of the goods used for burials, to increase our charge to Thirty Dollars each instead of the prevailing rate of Twenty Dollars which has been the case for some time past.   The above rate includes the removal of the dead body to our office, the furnishing of a coffin for the remains, the opening of the grave, and the use of the ground for the burial. It was not Mr. Bradley's nor is our intention of profiting on the work, but knowing his regard and desire that all men should he buried decently, we hope to have the opportunity of serving you in the future.   Trusting that you will see the necessity of the increase and that you will advise us if we are to continue as before, and hoping for a reply before we invest in the added ground, we remain,   Respectfully yours,    BRADLEY& SON,   JOHN J. BRADLEY
