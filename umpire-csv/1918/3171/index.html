We hope their kindness will not be unappreciated. Mr. Cattell, the speaker of the previous Saturday, was unanimously elected to Honorary Membership in the Club; and a letter of thanks ordered written to Mr. Lafferty for his services in securing him to speak to us. It was unanimously resolved that a fund be raised, under the auspices of the Club, to help in the obtaining of a pardon for A-8432, our excellent Vice-President, whose long continued service to the State certainly deserves some such reward, and anyway, we feel that he ought to be released, and give someone else the honor of being the Oldest Inhabitant.
