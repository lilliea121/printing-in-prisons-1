DANISH SLESVIG AT THE PEACE TABLE    JUSTICE CALLS FOR THE RIGHTING OF A GREAT WRONG FIFTY-FOUR YEARS AGO    To the Editor of Public Ledger:    Sir—Vast and far-reaching problems will present themselves to the peace conference. To settle them with justice toward all, with due regard for the principles for which this war has been fought to a glorious conclusion, will be such a tremendous task that some apparently small problem, some act of justice to a small nation, may unintentionally be overlooked. And for that reason I venture to-call attention to one problem— small in size and importance, but in point of justice long deferred and richly deserved, in the front rank.       I mean the return of Danish Slesvig to its motherland, Denmark. While one of the | smallest of European nations, Denmark is a the oldest now in existence. Ever since the beginning of history Slesvig has been a part of Denmark, until in 1864 Prussia and Austria, by the most barefaced robber-attack ever instigated, tore it away.
