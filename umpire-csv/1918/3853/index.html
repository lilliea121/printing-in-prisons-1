<p>PEACE He’s crying for peace, the yellow cur, With his legions in cowardly flight, He’s begging the chance he never gave France When he struck like a thief at night. But he didn’t cry peace four years ago As he murdered a cringing child— When Belgium’s death was the Hun’s life breath,  And his bloody hordes ran wild. He’s begging to save his tarnished crown And his vandal sons as well. With his heart of stone he craves the throne Of a race matured in hell. But he didn’t mind thrones four years ago As he slaughtered babes at play. When with beastly stroke the world’s war broke And his clans acclaimed “The Day.” So he’ll get the peace that he deserves And mercy’s a missing ban. When his blinded slaves are in’ trench-like graves. And we’ve crushed his filthy clan. When we’ve rid the world of a cancerous sore And banished the golden fleece— When the last Hun’s gone, and there’s clean pure dawn— We’ll grant the Kaiser peace. —JOHN R. ROBINSON, 19th Co., C. O. T. S., Camp Gordon, Ga.</p>
