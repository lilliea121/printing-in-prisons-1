<h1>A Touch of Real Christmas</h1>

<p>A TOUCH OF REAL CHRISTMAS There is a beautiful touch of Christmas spirit evident these days in the efforts of friends to make Yuletide to the women-folks in here as cheerful and happy as can be possible — Those who bring to these unfortunate sisters year after year the Christmas tree, the decorations and all the “ goodies” that go with it are moved by that sacred sentiment alone, that a woman in prison at Christmas time is a touching appeal, that can be answered no other way.— So they are made happy today, gathering around a good size Christmas tree, brightly illuminated, prettily decorated and heavily loaded down with all the “goodies” that are dear to a woman’s heart. May these little tokens of goodwill be to them a solace and a sign of hope of a brighter future. Last Saturday the Young Ladies of the Walnut street Presbyterian Club gave to these inmates of the Second Block a most beautiful entertainment, presided over by the President of the Club, Miss Martha Swartz.— Our Chaplain was present, who opened the entertainment with prayer and a word of good cheer to all. An interesting address was then delivered by Mrs. L. Barakat, followed by singing, music and recitations that soon enshrouded the little gathering with the spirit of a real Christmas.—</p>
