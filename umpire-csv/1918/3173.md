FOR UNIVERSAL TRAINING    Senator Warren G. Harding of Ohio, and William C. Sproul, president of the Union League Club and State Senator from Chester, were the honored guests at the twenty-fourth annual banquet of the Sons of Veterans recently.       Senator Harding in his address on the war said:       “What this country needs is universal military training. If we had adopted it three years ago we could have saved millions of dollars and possibly millions of lives. In this war we are making America safe for Americans, and while we are doing that we are making it safe for civilization. These things are worth fighting for, and if a country is not worth defending, it is not worth living in.”
