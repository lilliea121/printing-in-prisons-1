SHINE ON, RED CROSS!    For the healing of the nations God    has set you in His sky    As a never-failing promise that His    mercy from on high    Shall be showered, without’ favor, on    the stricken far and nigh    When Pain and Death stand by!    With the blood of many heroes He has    painted you, to say;    “Thru the darkness of disaster I will    guide you to the way    That shall lead from Hope’s despairing    to the glory of the day    Where Joy once more holds sway!”    In the yearning of a woman who had heard the cries of woe    From the dread Crimean stretches, you    were mothered long ago,    That the forces of destruction might    be smitten in their flow    By love’s unending glow!    Thru the wreck and waste of battles    you’ve kept shining for the soul    That in peace is now awaking to the    glory of the goal    To behold the heavenly vision of a    world once more made whole    When strife no more takes toll!
