HONOR CLUB NOTES At the meeting of the Board of Delegates on February 5th, the following applications for membership were received and accepted: B 8986, 8990, 8989, 7716, 8984, 8987, 8983, 8981, 8985, 8997, 8998, 8999, 8943, 8988, 9001, 9002, 8996, 8994-25c; 8982, 8993-10c; 9000, 15c. A motion was made, and passed, that a letter of thanks be written to the Board of Parole for the clemency they have lately shown, in giving so â€˜many of our members the chance of service they have sought. We hope their kindness will not be unappreciated. Mr. Cattell, the speaker of the previous Saturday, was unanimously elected to Honorary Membership in the Club; and a letter of thanks ordered written to Mr. Lafferty for his services in securing him to speak to us. It was unanimously resolved that a fund be raised, under the auspices of the Club, to help in the obtaining of a pardon for A-8432, our excellent Vice-President, whose long continued service to the State certainly deserves some such reward, and anyway, we feel that he ought to be released, and give someone else the honor of being the Oldest Inhabitant. During the week the following bills were paid: John Wanamaker, $4.80 for muslin and typewriter ribbons, and the following articles purchased from Inmates, B 6608, 2 pr. slippers $1.00; B 7102, 3 pr. slippers, $1.50; B 8575, 1 Toy Wagon, 75c; B 6964, 23 Watch Fobs, $11.50; B 8361, 1 Inlaid Box, $5.00; B 3079, 24 picture Frames, $6.30; B 6263, 12, Toy Birds, $3.00; B 7664, 9 neckties, $2.25; B 8040 1 Set of Toy Furniture $1.50; B 3079, Work on Carving, 30c; B 8361 11 School Companions $4.50.
