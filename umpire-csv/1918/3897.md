A REVISED VERSION WITH ALL DUE APOLOGIES TO THE SHADE OF TOM HOOD.    I remember, I remember, the house where I was born;    The pleasant smell of griddle-cakes that waked me every morn:    The heaping plate of griddle-cakes, with gravy on the side,    And all the little “sassidges” fair bursting in their pride.    I remember I remember, how I galloped down the stair,    And the grunt of satisfaction with which I pusht back my chair;    Now my days are spent in loning, and my nights in wild regret,    And in envy of my brothers who are doing these things yet.    I remember, I remember, when the dinner bell would ring.    I would not have traded places, emperor, or king;    There was never queen, or empress who could bake like mother could;    I bet she’d baked a million pies, and all of them were good.    I remember, I remember, —and I wish I could forget—    In the two years of my stay here, nota griddle-cake I’ve met;    And I’ve just been to the cupboard, and no single pie was there:    I remember, I remember, where I’m at —and want to swear.
