THE PARTING OF THE WAYS.    From the beginning of history until the present time, We read of the rise and fall of nations. There have been wars of varied character and circumstance, of bloodshed, outrage, and devastation, in all the changing races by whom the wars have been waged. There has not been much basis of choice among them, as to so-called humanity. But it has been reserved for a nation in the Twentieth Century of the Christian Era of undisputed attainments in the varied fields of science, to conceive and perfect, and then to most thoroughly put into execution, “The War“ that shall stand in the records of time, as the most comprehensive, selfish, cruel beyond description, and altogether devilish, ever waged by man.       We are now passing out of the active fury of its existence; the pain, misery, and shame, will stay for generations, burnt into the lives of some of the nations subject to it all. The peoples of the lands that have been scorched with fire, and deluged with blood, are now trying to get together, with their eyes toward Heaven, and their hands toward America, to build homes and found nations for the ages to come. For this, let them have our prayers and our help.
