CHAPLAIN PRESENTED WITH SILVER LOVING CUP.    From The Public Ledger    More than 200 men and women religious workers representing almost every church in the city paid tribute to the Rev. Joseph Welch yesterday, when at the conclusion of the regular religious services at the Eastern State Penitentiary they presented him with a magnificent silver loving cup as a token of their appreciation of his efforts to cooperate with them in looking after the spiritual needs of the prisoners in that institution.       Mr. Welch is chaplain of the penitentiary, and today is celebrating his eighty-second birthday, a fact which gave added significance to yesterdayâ€™s presentation. Mr. Welch has served twenty-seven years as chaplain and moral instructor at the prison, under six consecutive administrations.
