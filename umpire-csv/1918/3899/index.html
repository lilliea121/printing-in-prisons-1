<p>LIBRARY NOTES A new and modern card system will be introduced in our library in a week or two and it is therefore requested of all inmates to turn in all books, which they should happen to have in their possession and not accounted for on their slates.—When the new system takes effect it shall be expected of every man to abide with that rule, which reads: “Any exchange of books between prisoners will be regarded as a violation of the Rules of the Library, And will subject the individual so exchanging books to the loss of the Library altogether.” It is your violation of this Rule alone that unables the other fellow to get the book he so desires to read and which he has had on his slate for so long, so play fair in the future, do not pass your book from cell to cell nor “salt” it away for another reading, turn it in on the regular day when you have read it, and you are there by giving your aid in maintaining the efficiency of a Library, which is provided and run for your comfort and uplift. It may also be in place here to request of you to put your selections of books down on your slate in plain figures, and to renew them once in a while, and you are thereby not only aiding the employees of the Library, but you are standing a better chance to get the books you want. Abel Schall Jr. Librarian</p>
