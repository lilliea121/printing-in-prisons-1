SOLID FACTS WHICH THE GOOD FOLKS DON’T SEEM TO GET AROUND    That Washington swore a blue streak sometimes, while in the thick of battle.       That Bob Ingersoll died a beautiful death-- something that can’t be accounted for.       That Grant drank so heavily-his generalship saved the Union.       That Colonel Goethals built the Panama Canal smoking cigarettes. Ask him.       That Lincoln used to crack jokes of a nature that probably wouldn’t pass muster at a Suffrage Purity Club. Just think of the harm this man accomplished!       That the piles of dead bodies which had stopped the enemy’s invasions were not all Sunday-school boys.       That if it had’t been for all the aforesaid sinners, the immaculate ones ‘would never be enjoying their safety and freedom of speech which they so injudiciously use. Thank God for the sinners who rushed in where the self-sainted feared to tread.       There is an unconfirmed rumor that the Third Block will be again quarantined; a case of condensed milk having been found on it.
