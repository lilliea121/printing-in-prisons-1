<p>PAPERS PUBLISHED IN PRISON By EVERETT SPRING. There is a school of journalism in the United States which is seldom, perhaps never, heard of by the general public. It is called penal journalism and it thrives-only in jail. If you happen to be 4 member of Congress, or a prison official, you may have seen a copy of the leading exponent of penal journalism; but, as a rule, the readers are wholly men and women doing time for offenses against the law. These prison papers have the merit of representing the cleanest journalism of the United States. Not one of them is “yellow” or even sensational. They are all for the uplift, although not a few are amply enterprising and many of them are really clever. This unusual journalism follows closely in the steps of the new thought and general movement for the betterment of prisons and fora more humane rational treatment of convicts. It had its birth, and lives its life, behind tall gray walls and iron bars. It is for this reason that so little of its work reaches the genera! public, notwithstanding that, under the name of “penal journalism,” it embraces within its ranks several hundred inmates of the different penitentiaries scattered over the United States. About 28 years ago the first paper ever printed in any prison issued from the State institution in Stillwater, Minn., under the name of the Mirror. It was followed some years afterward by the Penitentiary News, published by inmates of the Ohio Penitentiary in Columbus; a little later the Star of Hope, at Sing Sing, made its appearance, followed by others at different institutions of incarceration. These papers were largely made up of Sunday school lessons, short stories by the inmates and some carefully censored matter from outside publications. From these beginnings grew the present-day penal journalism, which now number about 40 publications, issued from as many institutions, all readable, many pretentious and every one edited with a fine appreciation of the responsibilities resting upon the editorial shoulders. The object of these publications vary, but about one-half of them are avowedly engaged in the correcting of vindictive punishment and inhuman treatment of prisoners and in enlightening the public with a knowledge of the real man behind the bars, urging his right to be treated as a human being while in prison and the chance for him to make an honest living when he is discharged. The most effective of this class of prison papers is Good Words, published by inmates of the Federal prison at Atlanta, Ga. under the sanction of the Department of Justice. It has quite a circulation among government officials, members of Congress and senators. It numbers some very brilliant writers among its staff of contributors and was once under the editorial direction of Julian Hawthorne. Another prison paper was the outgrowth of the base-ball privileges accorded the inmates for the first time about five years ago. Naturally, both players and fans wanted to see their favorite teams exploited in type and the base-ball journal was the result. Within the last few years, however, the policy of this has been changed. At present it is attempting the moral uplift of the inmates through carefully prepared matter, in which is concealed the lesson intended to be conveyed———very much for the same reason that children are given their castor oil in capsules. This paper is very proud of its distinction of being the only prison publication carrying a column of “adds” in which local manufacturers exploit the merits of the many novelties they are making and offering for sale. The Better Citizen, published in the New Jersey reformatory, is another one of these publications doing good work. As its readers are mostly boys and young men with a craving for true stories of adventure, interesting material is supplied in unlimited quantities by graduates of the institution, who relate the stories of their early struggles and final successes, appealing strongly to the readers and undoubtedly doing them good. It is a singular streak in the make-up of these men that, no matter how depraved their tastes in almost every other direction, they invariably lean to that class of literature which depicts virtue as always triumphant: The most remarkable of these publications, from a mechanical point of view, is the Mentor, of the Charlestown (Mass.) State prison. It is a monthly, containing 50 pages of text, which is magnificently engrossed, by hand, of course, and duplicates obtained by mimeographing. All of the tiles, head and tail pieces, ornaments, etc., are the work of prison artists. The whole represents an amount of patient labor not to be found, or expected, outside of a prison or monastery. While a censorship is maintained over these papers, it is not so rigid as one might suppose. The editors have the widest latitude, especially in the matter of commenting on prison conditions, where the subject must be treated in a general way and criticism not applied to individuals or to any one institution. The Chaplain of the prison usually acts as the censor, and in this connection it is worthy of remark that the prison officials, as a rule, do not attempt to control the subject matter or policy, either by rule or suggestion but permit the editor to proceed along their own lines. After experience they learn to know the extent to which they may go, and therefore, rarely meet with objections from the censor. Many of the inmates contribute to the columns of the prison papers, spending long hours in putting some story or thought into presentable shape, and then pruning and polishing it over and over again, until they feel satisfied it will meet with the approval of the editor. Criminals are not different from the rest of mankind in the desire to see their names attached to some article in print. Singularly enough, the prison writer runs to “poetry” and rarely attempts prose. As a rule, when he ventures anything serious or sentimental he is inclined to “gush” and the result is often ludicrous, There is yet another class of men, possessing the education and ability to write, who refuse to contribute to the prison paper, as being something too trivial on which to waste their talents. However, when one considers the ambition the prison papers inspire in many men to accomplish the production of a really meritorious article and the education and experience they must gain through the effort, one cannot help but feel that, after all, the prison paper has a distinctive and growing field of usefulness. —Utica Sat.
