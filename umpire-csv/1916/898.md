UNKNOWN BENEFACTORS       Apart from the sheer human wonder aroused by the wireless telephone communication with Honolulu, the most remarkable fact seems to be that this application of research has .been carried out by a business corporation, says the “New Republic,” and that the inventors and scientists remain anonymous. As evidence of human motive there is much to think about here. What is the incentive which impels these unknown workers, what secret have these corporations discovered which enables them to tap so inexpensively the most useful minds in America? When next we read that the enterprise Would collapse with dazzling rewards, that human nature is so and so, we shall not be able to refrain from thinking of these nameless benefactors of mankind. Their incentive seems somehow to be as good as those of the men who are piling up fortunes in war speculation, or of those who had grandfathers with a vision of real estate development.
