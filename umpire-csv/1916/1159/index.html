<p>EASTER SONG SERVICE In keeping with the Easter spirit, the combined choirs and E. S. P. orchestra gave a fine “Song service’ on the Center on Sunday afternoon last. Prof. A. F. Wiegandt’s arrangement of this program was of the best music and sacred song, which was effectually rendered by the men under his direction. Of special interest was the singing of B 7962 who sang The Palms in a good voice of much natural sweetness. Prof. Wiegandt is to be congratulated on the fine results of his training of the inmate members of both choir and orchestra. At the conclusion of the service Chaplain Joseph Welch addressed the men on the subject of “Today and Tomororw,” which was both interesting and instructive. Following Chaplain Welch, Warden McKenty made a few brief and cheering remarks to the men, which was greeted with applause.</p>
