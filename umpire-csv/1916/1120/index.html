<p>SCIENTIFIC AND OTHERWISE When silk worms begins to produce silk they spin at the rate of six inches a minute. Each caterpillar produces from 500 to 1,000 yards of continuous thread. A pound of silk represents the work of about 3,000 caterpillars. A large elephant, carrying tusks weighing nearly 200 pounds, choked to death on frogs recently in one of the provinces of Sudan, while drinking at a pool. The batrachians were sucked into the elephantâ€™s trunk with such force that they lodged in the wind pipe and shut off the air. Most varieties of fish have no eyelids at all, a shiny membrane or a thick transparent skin covering them and protecting them from injury. Their eyes are constantly in use except when they are asleep. A variety known as the puffer, or swellfish, which burrows in the sand at the bottom has eyelids which cover the eyeball when closed, the lower lid being larger than the upper. It is reported that a meteor several feet in diameter fell recently on a farm near Stetsonville, Wis. The huge stone illuminated the country for some distance and when it landed the shock broke windows in several houses in the vicinity. A brilliant meteor was also seen in the Ohio valley a few days ago. It exploded so violently as to startle people living in southern Ohio, Indiana, and part of Kentucky.</p>
