MOVIES TO SHOW PICTURES OF HUMAN BLOOD IN CIRCULATION By taking microscopic moving pictures of the blood in circulation in the human body, it is expected that enlarged pictures may be projected on the screen at the moving picture shows. This exacting work has been developed recently under the direction of Dr. C. E. Stewart, at one of Battle Creek, Michigan, sanitariums. These pictures, said to be the first of their kind ever produced, will show how the blood is circulated through the body, where, how and why obstructions arise and the methods of treating poor circulation. Several months of the most painstaken and exacting work were, required to produce these pictures. Great credit is due to Dr. Stewart for his success in this line of work, as it required a rare order of patience and skill to accomplish satisfactory results.
