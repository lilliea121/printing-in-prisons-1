BETHLEHM ——CALVARY    By C. de B. L Bright       Christmas !—or Easter-tide    Which love we most?    Holly and misletoe!    Frost-king-and ghost.    Traced in the icy drift    Seen ’mid the shadows    Under the woodland-tree    This season hallows.    Reign thou, O joy and mirth    Banish all sadness.    Naught must we offer thee    But of our gladness.    Wreathe we Thy cross to-day,    Saviour, all-glorious;    Who, from the gloom and grave    Rises victorious.    Brighter than Bethlehem’s Star    Is the beam falling    Softly o’er Calvary’s height    This Easter morning.    Joyful we now can say,    In song and story,    Life is Thy gift to-day    Through Death to Glory.       Printed By Request
