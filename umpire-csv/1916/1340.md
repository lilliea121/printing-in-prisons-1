CATHOLIC SOCIETY PROVIDES AN AFTERNOON OF SONG       Under the auspices of the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, St. John's Asylum Boys visited the E. S. P. on Sunday last, for the purpose of giving an entertainment of music and song to the inmates. The program consisted of some thirteen numbers of choice musical selections, and the sweetness of the youthful voices gave additional beauty to the songs rendered.       Several of St. Johnâ€™s choir soloists accompanied the Asylum Boys in their visit and gave substantial evidence of their ability to render high grade music with excellent harmony and effect. The work of Conductor Alfons Heuermann was most apparent in the fine control and shading of the various selections by the boy choristers.
