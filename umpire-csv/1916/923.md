FOOLS AND THEIR FOLLY       A late report from the western part of this State mentions a case where one man died and another was about to die, as the result of an idiotic wager to see which could drink the most whiskey at one time. One managed to drink four quarts of the stuff, while the other could only drink three. At this stage, one fell to the floor in a stupor, while the other managed to get to his home close by.       This is another illustration of the pure foolhardiness of some men, who seem to lack ordinary common sense, and it brings to mind the old proverb about “a fool: falling a victim of his own folly.”      The man who is always thinking of some life-risking trick to play upon another, instead of using his brain to some useful purpose, is another unfortunate of the same order. In the first instance it would seem as though the all wise Creator had provided ways for the elimination of such unfortunate weaklings.       This also brings to mind the thought that if we are to continue to allow the free use of liquor to the foolish and weak minded, it would perhaps be best to give them a sufficient quantity to make an early finish in their headless race of self destruction.       By such a course, much violence, crime, misery and want might be avoided; not to say anything of the afflictions of loathsome disease that are too often passed along to the innocent and helpless.
