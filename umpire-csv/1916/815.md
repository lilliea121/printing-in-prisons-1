Senator Vare Tells Business Men Suffrage Is Dead    Senator Edwin H. Vare asserted woman suffrage is dead in this State, in a speech at the annual banquet of the Cohecksink Business Men’s Association, held at the Hotel Washington, in this city. The Senator declared he was no longer interested in woman suffrage, and didn't care whether the majority of women wanted it or not. He said it was a matter that was for the male voters to say whether “their women should have the vote.” He remarked that the last election showed clearly that it was not wanted.       The Senator devoted some attention to the “plain people.” He said they were behind all the good legislation we had secured in the last four years.
