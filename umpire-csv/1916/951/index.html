<p>BATTLESHIP DRIVE BY ELECTRICITY When the United States superdreadnaught, “California,” is launched this year at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, the first battleship in the world to be driven by electricity will take to the ocean. Curiously enough, it will slip down the ways just one hundred years after the first steam-propelled battleship went to pieces in a terrific boiler explosion while she lay at the Navy Yard dock. The “California” will derive her power from turbogenerators. These vary but little in construction from turbogenerators in use ashore. ‘Operated at normal capacity they will insure the new battleship an average speed of twenty-one knots. Slow-speed motors will transmit ‘the power to the propellers, thus doing away with strain on the crankshafts. Four screws will drive the ship, and provision is made whereby, in case of emergency, one generator alone will suffice to operate her. Ready for sea service, the “California” will represent an expenditure of over seven million dollars. Her length will be 624 feet; her breadth. ninety-seven feet and her draft thirty feet. She will have a displacement of thirty-two thousand tons and will carry a main battery of twelve 14-two 5-inch rapid-fire guns.</p>
