AN EVENING OF MUSIC AND SONG       The members of the Matinee Musical Club, sprung a very pleasing surprise on Warden McKenty and the officers of the E. S. P., on Thursday night last week.       The visitors who are well known in Philadelphiaâ€™s music circles, gave a number of fine vocal and instrumental selections of unusual tuneful excellence.       The soloists beauty of voice and masterful dexterity of technic at the piano. It is seldom that one has the unusual pleasure of listening to such delightful music from such gifted artists.       Miss Laura Dickson, of 4414 Pine St, this city, proved to be an adept leader, and she was well supported by the other members of the club, consisting of Mr. K. C. Holtesman, Miss Flora Canon, Miss Catharine Meislie, Miss Anna M. Thomson, Miss Adlina Patti Noar, Miss Florence Haule and Miss Helen Anders
