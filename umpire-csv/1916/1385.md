According to the opinion of U.S. Commissioner of education, Dr. P. P. Claxton, it is necessary to the vital interests of the nation, that citizens of the United States should educate themselves and keep abrest with the times. He points out the fact that no democracy has ever been known to exist more than 150 years, and if this nation expects to continue longer than that is must “establish means by which public opinion purifies, readjusts and expresses itself.” We believe this may best be done through the ballot, the schoolroom, and a bonified effort to legislate for the interests of the people as a whole.
