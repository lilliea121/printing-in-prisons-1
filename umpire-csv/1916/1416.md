Boy Choir Gives Song Service       A pleasing afternoon of song was afforded the inmates of this institution on Sunday last, by the visit of the Boy Choir of the Episcopal Church of Our Saviour, of West Philadelphia.       The clear sweetness of the youthful voices gave added charm to the tuneful hymns which were sung on the Center.       Two solos by adult members of the choir were clearly rendered with fine tonal quality and evenness of voice, proving their reputation for good singing to be well founded. The entire program was well selected and handled by the choristers in a manner redounding their credit.
