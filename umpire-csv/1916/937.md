BETHLEHEM STEEL PLANT TO BE EXPANDED       The plans that the Bethlehem Steel Corporation have in view in the way of alterations or extensions to its newly acquired properties of the Pennsylvania Steel Company, principally at Steelton and Sparrows Point, Md., are now nearly perfected, said a local official of the Corporation recently.       Plans for the expenditure of millions of dollars are under way, though nothing positive has been decided. It can be said, however, that present plans do not include a big shipyard at Sparrows Point.      President E. G. Grace, of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, and a party of officials, arrived home Monday, after making a several days’ inspection trip of the new properties. In an interview President Grace said:       “We have completed our inspection trip of the properties of the Pennsylvania Steel Company at Steelton, Pa., and Sparrows Point, Md., and are favorably impressed with our new acquisition. We have noticed the papers quoting us saying that instead of making certain contemplated improvements at Bethlehem they would be transferred to Maryland Point.       It is quite possible that certain additional lines which we had planned ultimately to place at South Bethlehem may go to either Maryland or Steelton, but, if so, other lines will take their place in our development at South Bethlehem.       We may find that it will be more advantageous to place certain products at Maryland or Steelton, while other lines will be better located at South Bethlehem; but we wish to take the opportunity of assuring the public that in building up the new properties we shall in no way lessen the importance of the Bethlehem plant or its further development.”
