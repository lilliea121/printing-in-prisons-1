<p>LARGEST AUTO SHOW ON RECORD Grand Central Palace Thronged With A Crowd of 51,000 In One Day The automobile show just closed at N. Y. city was the largest ever held at the Grand Central Palace—the biggest show in attendance, the biggest in the number and character of exhibits. The show has been a record breaker in every way. The attendance was 51,000, in one day, that being a record for attendance up to that time. The managers of the show express great satisfaction at the results of this year’s show. The buying capacity of the crowds has been even more impressive, in comparison with the visitors of former years, than the numbers who have viewed the automobiles on display. Representatives of the manufacturers of complete cars and accessories said that the volume of business done by them had exceeded all expectations and were optimistic.</p>
