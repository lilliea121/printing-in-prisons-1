GERMAN U-BOAT ARRIVES IN PORT       The Deutschland, the world’s first submarine, arrived at Baltimore on Sunday last. She is a vessel 315 feet long and 30 feet wide, and carries a compliment of 29 men and a commander.       It took the submarine 16 days to cross the Altantic with her cargo of 1000 tons of dyestuffs and chemicals, and it is said that the officer in command bears a message from Emperor William to President Wilson.’       The submarine was chased for 30 hours by the Allies warships and succeeded in eluding them by going some 800 miles out of her course.       The Deutschland started from Bremerhaven and is an entirely new commercial owened by a company in Bremen.
