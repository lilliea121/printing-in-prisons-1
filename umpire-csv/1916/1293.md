Hardly a generation ago the metal aluminium was exhibited in classes in chsmistry only in small pieces, as a rarity. Its method of production from the natural source was so difficult and expensive that only small pieces of it were kept on hand for exhibiting as specimens. The change that has taken place in this generation has been so rapid that this may be not improperly called an age of aluminium.

A considerable proportion of this is used in the production of automobiles.
