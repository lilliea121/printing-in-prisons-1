Wednesday’s Games    Cubs—3 Printers—1       The Printers could not solve Boyd’s delivery, and went down to defeat at the hands of the Cub machine, by the score of 8 to 1.       Boyd was given the margin of a tally in the first stanza, when Albie worked the squeeze to a nicety; laying the ball down the first base line, scoring Pidge.       Barney made a sensational running catch, while Jacoby and Albie starred in the inner garden.       Boyd fanned 8, passed 2, and 1 hit by pitched ball. Slats struck out 4 and passed 4,       Score by innings as follows:       R. H. E. Cubs 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0—3 7 1 Printers 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0—1 5 1       Doubles— Blink.       Umpires—Fred and Harmon.
