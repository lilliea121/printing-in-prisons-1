OUR FIRST NAVY AIRSHIP    We are soon to have our first naval airship, which is now nearing completion at the factory of an aircraft manufacturing plant in Connecticut. According to the final specification, the airship is to be 175 feet long, its maximum height 50 feet, and its greatest beam 35 feet. Where the fins are attached, the beam is increased to 50 feet. The volume of the envelope is to be 115,000 cubic feet, while each balloonette is to have a capacity of 15,000 cubic feet. The weight of the envelope is to be 15,090 pounds. The dead weight of the machine is specified as 4000 pounds, while the lifting effort is 7800 pounds, leaving the carrying capacity in the neighborhood of 3800 pounds of useful load. The dirigible is to be driven by a 150-horsepower motor.
