The Tipping Law Invalid       The Iowa antitipping law was held to be unconstitutional by Judge George Jepson in the District Court, Sioux City, recently. The Court held the law was class legislation. The decision was rendered in the case of a barber arrested for taking a 25-cent tip.       President and Mrs. Wilson unwittingly violated the law on their recent trip through that State by tipping persons who waited on them.
