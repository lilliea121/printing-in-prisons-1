THE PATH OF THE PILGRIM    By Janet Thurber       Never to lose in the seeking    The sight of the goal to attain,    Never to pause in the working    Though the labor bring bittesest pain.       Only to hear on the night wind    The voice that has call at dawn,    Never to sink or be weary    With doubts of the swift-coming morn.       Never to falter from fearing,    Never to cease to desire,    Never to stumble from watching    The light from a wandering fire.       Always to follow and strive    Holding your faith for your star,    Knowing the spirit of love    Worketh wherever you are.
