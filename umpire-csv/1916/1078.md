QUICK ACTION OF MINER SAVES FORTY COMPANIONS      A Wilkes-Barre, Pa., report states that forty miners in the Butler colliery of the Hillside Coal Company, at Browntown, escaped death last Friday by wading through water up to their necks when the mine was flooded. Only the quick action of James Frearick saved the miners from death.       Frearick and three others broke through an old working unexpectedly and released a big body of water that had collected in the “Cork and Bottle” shaft that was abandoned 20 years ago. In a few seconds water was up to their knees. Nearby were 37 miners and laborers at work. Frearick, the only man who knew the working, led his helpers to the men, By the time they were on the main gangway the water was up to their necks.
