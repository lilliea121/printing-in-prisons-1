Nonsupport Law Declared Unconstitutional by the Superior Court The Superior Court declared unconstitutional “the lazy husband act,’ which gives the court power to send husbands who refuse to support their wives to jail, there to work on a rock pile. The County Commissioners and Taxpayer’s Association declared that if the law was upheld the wife of every lazy man in the State would place him behind the bars for the sake of the money. The opinion was given in an appeal from a decision by Judge Bechtel.
