Charles J. Murray      We are sorry to learn of the death of Overseer Charles J. Murray, one of the night force at this institution. Mr. Murray had been in the State service only a few months, but in that time had made many friends here. He leaves a wife and family here. He leaves a wife and family of small children, to whom we extend our sincere sympathy in their hour bereavement.
