WHO AM I    I am more powerful than the combined armies of the world.    I have destroyed more than all the wars in the world.    I am more deadly than bullets and I have wrecked more homes than the mightiest of siege guns.    I steal, in the United States alone, $30,000,000 each year.    I spare no one, and I find my victims among the rich and poor alike; the young and the old; the strong and the weak; widows and orphans know me    I loom up to such proportions that I cast my shadows over field of labor, from turning of the grindstone to the moving of every railroad train,    I massacre thousands upon thousands of wage earners in a year.    I lurk in unseen places and do most of my work silently. You are warned against me but you heed not.    I am relentless. I am everywhere; in the home, on the streets, in the factory, at railroad crossings, and on the sea.    I bring sickness, degradation and yet few seek to avoid me.    I destroy, crush or maim; I give nothing, but take all.    I am your worst enemy.   I am CARELESSNESS!â€”Exchange.
