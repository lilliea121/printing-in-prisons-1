U. S. SHIPS TO PATROL SEAS AS PEACE POLICE       “It may be necessary for peaceful Powers, led by the United States, to police the world when the war is over if commerce and civilization are not to be reduced to chaos.” G.

Mr. Dickinson also delivered an address in Houston Hall on “After War, What?”
