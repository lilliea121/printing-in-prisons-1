WARDEN McKENTY TO SPEAK AT CIVIC RALLY       Warden Robert J. McKenty has been invited to speak on penology and prison reform, at the first civic rally of the Drexel Biddle Bible Classes tomorrow night, in the Fifth St. Methodist Temple. Representative Isadore Stern and A. J. Drexel Biddle will also deliver addresses.       This is said to be the largest Bible class in the city, which will assure the Warden of a good attendance on this occasion.
