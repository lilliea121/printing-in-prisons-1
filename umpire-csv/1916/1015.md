COLD RECORDS BROKEN FOR MARCH 18       Low temperature records for March 18 were broken Saturday when the cold wave developed in intensity, forcing the mercury in the Weather Bureau down to 10 below zero, while the suburbs reported reading as low as 2 above, and northern Pennsylvania temperatures from zero to 16 below.       The unusually cold weather was general through out the East moderating during the day only to be followed by snow, gave promise of more sleighing before the arrival of warmer weather from the West. Reports from York County stated that a large percentage of the buds on fruit trees had been frozen. Otherwise, no damage apparently was caused by the cold which only evoked surprise, considering that spring began at 5:39 p.m.
