Diamond Dust       Chick of the Ninth is regaining his batting eye.       Jacoby of the Printers is pitching great ball this season.       Jordan and Hagy are falling off in batting of late.       The Printers strengthened their team considerably by getting Bobby and Cope.       The race in the American and National Leagues, are growing more exciting ev: ry day, as the teams are changing places daily.      Perhaps having seen the Athletics in action had something to do with the ad men selecting St. Louis as their next place of meeting.      General Price’s request for 200 additional recruits should have been addressed to Connie Mack instead of Mayor Smith, as recruits are as common at Shibe Park as bases on balls.       One man in baseball history placed himself -in the hall of fame by delivering just one ball— calling for probably only a few seconds’ actual participation in the game. He was manager Childs, of the Portsmouth, Ohio, team. Ina game with Marion June 20, 1910, Childs went into the box and pitched one ball. It resulted into a triple play, and Childs got credit, of course, for pitching an entire inning with one heave, the only time it has ever been accomplished.
