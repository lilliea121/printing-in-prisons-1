THE ANCIENT PORT OF BRINDISI       The much talked of Brindisi, naval base of the Italians and the port from which the Latins are again sending expeditions into the Balkans and into Northern Africa, has been a war harbor from remote antiquity. At one time it was the first warport of the Western World, when the fleets of Rome bore invincible legions to every region around the Middle Sea, begins an article in the National Geographic Magazine. â€œA people, who rules along the Adriatic shores long before the infancy of Imperial Rome, made a pirate nest at Brindisi, and took a rich toll on the commerce that passed the narrow gateway of Otranto. Later, when the port had become a Roman one, Roman soldiers left this point on missions of conquest for Macedonia, Syria and Northern Africa. In the Middle Ages, the Crusaders made it one of their chief ports for embarkation to the Holy land.
