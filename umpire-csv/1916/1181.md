SCIENTIFIC NOTES       Geologists tell us that during the Eocene era, when the shores of the Gulf of Mexico lay considerably farther inland than at the present time, a long baylike extension of the gulf filled the present valley of the Mississippi up to the mouth of the Ohio, says a bulletin of the U.S., geoglogical survey. The boundaries of this ancient bay were not stationary, but shifted slowly back and forth from time to time so that open sea was gradually replaced by brackish water, and this by swamps and peat bogs, The succeeding advance of the sea buried these all peat bogs beneath accumulations of clay, sand and sea shells.
