CHOIR AND ORCHESTRA GIVE SONG SERVICE       The E. S. P. orchestra and choir gave a fine ‘Song Service on the Center at. this institution on Sunday last.       The choir did exceptionally well with the hymns, singing in good harmony and full volume of tone. This is all the more praiseworthy when the continuous changing of inmate members is considered.       The orchestra also did clever work in the execution of the several numbers of the program, bringing out an even blending of the different gradations of orchestral effects. This shows the earnest efforts of: Professor A F. Wiegandt to maintain a. high standard of ability for the men under his direction.       Concluding the services Chaplain Joseph Welch addressed the inmates: present, urging the necessity «of constant effort to: secure a right attitude of mind, so that lasting results will follow on going into the outer world. “By constant effort we build and grow, which is only following out the Universal law. He who lesitates or stops, and no longer tries to improve, is lost; and that is the weakness which must be checked before it is too late.”
