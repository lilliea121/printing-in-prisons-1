AMERICAN SHIPS TO OPERATE IN ORIENT TRADE       In a dispatch from San Francisco it is learned that seven American freighters, manned by American crews and flying the flag of the recently organized $10,000,000 Oriental Alliance Steamship Company, are to be placed on the trans-Pacific run between San Francisco and the Orient, according to Peter D. Malloy, president of the Company. The company will later operate two boats between New York and San Francisco through the Panama Canal. All the boats will come from Atlantic waters.
