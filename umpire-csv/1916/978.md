ELECTRIC RAIN       A new scheme for artificially producing rain is to be tried out in Australia, where there are large sections of land that would be valuable for agricultural purposes if sufficient moisture could be insured. A captive balloon at a height of 6000 to 7000 feet and anchored in the path of prevailing winds will be used to discharge electricity into the atmosphere; and it is hoped thus to cause sufficient ionization to provide nuclei upon which the moisture of the clouds will condense.
