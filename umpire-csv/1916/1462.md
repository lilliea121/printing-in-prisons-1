SPARKS       It is worse to feel poor than to be poor.       The whole world is longing to do a kindness but is rendered callous by traditions that stalk in the guise of culture, creed or “real” charity.      Create an atmosphere in which others can do their best and your own burdens will be lightened.       Charities should cater to the uplift of their clients rather than to their contributors’ whims.       Economy is a virtue or a vice according to what you save on.       A horse of another color can do team work. You can be and think differently from others and yet work in with every one who is pulling in the direction of the common weal.       Where you find temper do not look for truth; where you find indignation, righteousness is nigh.       The people who have next to nothing to do spread next to nothing out so thin it covers all their time.
