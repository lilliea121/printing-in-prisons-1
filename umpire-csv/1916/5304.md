Ninth 10—Cubs 2       Harvey’s contingent of baseball players, the Ninth block team, assaulted the fast Cub team and took them into camp by a score of 10—2.    Mack was in the pitcher’s box for the Ninth and showed mid-season form allowing 4 hits, 6 strike-outs and passed 1.    Albie and Boyd for the Cubs, were touched for 12 hits, fanned 12 and walked 2.    Boyd started strong, but the Ninth got after him in the sixth, and pounded him for 6 runs, enough to win the game.    Petrillo and Bobby starred in the inner garden.    Taylor and Walter led in batting for the Cubs, while Chick, the Ninth third baseman, featured the game with a home run, a double and two singles in 4 times at the bat.
