THE BAR Written by a prisoner serving life sentence in a western penitentiary. The Saloon is sometimes called A Bar. A Bar to heaven, a door to hell; Whosoever named it, named it well. A Bar to manliness and wealth; A door to want and broken health. A Bar to honor, pride and fame; A door to grief and sin and shame. A Bar to hope, a Bar to prayer, A door to darkness and dispair. A Bar to honored, useful life; A door to brawling senseless strife A Bar to all that’s true and brave, A door to every drunkard’s grave, A Bar to joys that home imparts, A door to tears and aching hearts; A Bar to heaven, a door to hell, Whosoever named it, named it well.
