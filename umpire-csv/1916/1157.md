BOYâ€™S KNOWLEDGE OF BIBLE SECURES HIS LIBERTY      Judge MacNeille, who admitted that he was ignorant of the biblical name of Onesimus when a young negro said where it was to be found in the Bible, gave the boy his freedom in the Juvenile Court after he had read the Scripture where the name appeared. The boy, Onesimus Roberts, 4 years old, promptly pointed to the Epistle of Paul Philemon when the Judge said there was no such name as Onesimus.      The Judge placed the boy on probation after he explained that he read the Epistle and found it was a letter written by Paul pleading to Philemon that Onesimus be forgiven, although he had misbehaved. He said he would follow the Scriptures and give the boy another chance.
