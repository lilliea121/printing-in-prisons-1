UNDERSTANDING   By Rose De Vaux-Royer   “He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.”      Have pity, Thou, for the unseeing eye;—   For him who, seeing, understandeth not.    Oh, raise their insight to the perfect sky   Of promised vision by the earth-bound sought!      Restore the sound attuned beyond the sense;    Re-string the hearing to Truth’s highest tone:   Unto the failing give Thou recompense   For prayers unspoken, mighty deeds undone.      Oh, lend compassion to the fettered mind,    Grouping the falt’ring of Lifes winding way,   That thro’ the sin-mist these at length may find   The path that leads unto the Perfect Day.
