JUDGE BEN B. LINDSEY SERIOUSLY ILL       From a Denver, Col., report we learn that Judge Ben B. Lindsey, of Juvenile Court fame, who was operated on recently for the removal of a tumor from his back, lies critically ill at his home there, and his friends are greatly alarmed over his condition.       What was thought to be insignificant growth turned out to be a tumor as large as a grapefruit. For two days Judge Lindsey’ arms were paralyzed as a result of the operation. He has become weak through loss of blood and a high fever. Should Judge Lindsey’s condition take a turn for the worst, his loss would be keenly felt by all interested in modern methods of juvenile court reform.
