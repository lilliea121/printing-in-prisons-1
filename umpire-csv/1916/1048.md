PRISON LABOR ADVOCATED BY MICHIGAN WARDEN       According to a Washington report, it was recently claimed by James Russell, Warden of the penitentiary of Marquette, Mich., before a Senate Committee, that remunerative employment of convicts would not be opposed by working men if the question were put to a vote.       He opposed the bill to prohibit shipment of prison-made goods in interstate commerce.       Mr. Russell said convicts labor produces about one-tenth of one per cent of the product of free labor in this country. To confine convict made goods strictly to the uses proposed in the pending bill, he said would restrict a prison authority so that sufficient work for convicts could not be found.
