Thursday’s Games    Printers—4 Ninth—3       Lack of hard work and several costly errors played a prominent part in the Ninth’s losing to the Printers by score of 4—3.       The pitching honors was about equally divided between Mac. for the Ninth and Hagy for the Printers; Mac. having allowed 7 hit, walked 2 and struck out 11.       Hagy also allowed 7 hits, walked 1 and struck out 7.       The work of Buck, the Printers back stop, was one of the features of the game.       R. H.
