WHAT MISTAH TROUBLE DID       Ol’ Mitsah Trouble, he came aroun’ one day   An’ say, “I gwinter git you, so you better run away!   I likes to see you hustle. Dat’s de way I has my fun   I knows I kin Ketch up to you, no matter how you rin!”   I says “Mistah Trouble, you has been chasing me   Ever since I kin remember, an’ I’se tired as I kin be.   So I’se gwinter stop right yere, an’ turn around, a-facing you,   An’ lick you if I kin, an’ fin’ out jest what you kin do.”   Ol’ Mitstah Trouble, he looked mightily ashamed;   He acted like a buckin’-hoss dat’s suddenly been tamed;   An’ den he turned an’ traveled off, a hollerin,’ “Good day;   I ain’t got time to fool around wif folks dat acts dat wat.”   —Washington Star.
