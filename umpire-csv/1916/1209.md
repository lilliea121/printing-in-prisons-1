SCIENTIFIC NOTES       An easy way to locate a splinter under the finger nail is to go into a dark room and place the fleshy part of the finger against the lens of a pocket flashlight. The light will plainly show the location of the splinter through the nail.       The soap-berry tree which grows in the humid parts of Ecuador, attaining a height of about 50 feet, produces large quantities of fruit whose skin and pulp are so saponaceous that they are used instead of soap by many of the people living there. The seeds which are quite hard are polished and used for buttons on menâ€™s clothing in England and Spain. They are also used as beads.       The experience of French soldiers in the European war has demonstrated that milk is one of the most powerful stimulants known. So beneficial have been the results obtained from its use that the government has urged the sale of milk instead of soft drinks to soldiers off duty for rest and recreation behind the trenches, The great advantage of this fluid as a drink for fighting men lies in the fact that it stimulates them effectively, neither befogging their minds, dulling their sense or effecting the steadiness of their nerves.
