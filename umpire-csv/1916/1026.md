*To Overseer      Good night, you say. Good night.    I thank you for this kindly thought    Expressed in words of pleasing tone;    May the night bear out to you a    Galdsome fullness of the heart.    Good night, my friend. But ere    You go, listen; this I have to say:    That as the night is followed by    The day, the sun in turn shines forth    O’er land and sea to cheer the hearts of men.    And as the sun, so may the ray    Of light within your heart shine out,    And fill with joy, your path through life.       “Carl”— Editor       * Note. These lines are addressed to the friendly Overseer (name unknown to me) of the E.S.P., who always says, good night, before turning off the light at night.— Editor.
