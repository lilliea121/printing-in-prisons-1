<h1>Tricks In War News</h1>

<p>TRICKS IN WAR NEWSThe old saying about “tricks in all trades,” seems to hold true in official war reports written since the beginning of hostilities in Europe. The reports have followed a literary technique of their own. Among the rules of bulletin writing that will never be changed are those which prescribe that little victories shall be described at much greater length than big victories, that small defeats shall be promptly acknowledged for the purpose of creating an atmosphere of absolute frankness, and that serious reverses shall at first be passed over in silence, then alluded to as a matter of course, and ever after that characterized as a strategic retirement, a rectification of the front, a readjustment of the wings in closer cooperation with the center, a consolidation of position, a withdrawal from position that had lost importance, and so forth. These are the classical methods, and they have been liberally employed in the present war. If for instance, one were to reread the official dispatches from Petrograd during the Galician battles of May and June, one would seldom find the word retreat or retirement. But on successive days or in successive weeks the dispatches calmly speak of fighting before Tarnow, the fighting on the Wisloka, the fighting at Przemysl, our front West of Lemberg, our front east of Lemberg, each position being from ten to twenty miles in the rear of the position last mentioned. An army is never beaten an army seldom retreats, and yet somehow an army is found a good deal farther behind where rife was the week before.</p>
