INVISIBLE SHIPS    The enormous range and accuracy of modern naval guns makes it highly important for small war craft, which depends upon speed rather than armor plate to weather the attacks of the enemy, to render themselves as invisible as possible. Heretofore, a dark gray paint has been considered the best color to supply to a war vessel. Now experiments are being made with varieties of colors. Ideas are being borrowed from the mimicry of nature. We find certain animals cloaked with spotted fur and others with stripes, depending upon the nature of their environment, and these colorings make them very difficult to discover in their natural habitat. In exactly the same way our naval authorities are trying to render torpedo boats invisible by painting wavy stripes on them.
