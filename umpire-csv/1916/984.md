WOULD POLICE MEXICO WITH LARGE ARMY Senator Fall Urges Invasion Of That Country to Protect U. S. Citizens A New York report states that Senator Albert B. Fall, Republican, of New Mexico, at the close of his address yesterday at the Lawyers’ Club on the policy of the United States toward Mexico said: “I favor the immediate organization of an army of 500,000 men, ostensibly for the policing of Mexico, or for the invasion of that country to protect our citizens if necessary. I do not mean that the United States should annex Mexico. That I would never agree to, but should it be kept in a peaceful condition as a buffer State between this country and Latin-American republics to the south of it.”
