THEORETICAL WAR BETWEEN FLEET AND LAND FORTIFICATION The assertion of a Washington report that the War and Navy Departments have decided upon a test of the long-range guns of the Atlantic fleet against those on land fortifications was assured when a party of army and navy officers and Representative Swagar Sherley, of Kentucky, chairman of the House Subcommittee on fortifications, departed for Mobile, Ala., where the tests will be made. Brigadier General Erasmus M. Weaver, Brigadier General William Crozier and Colonel Charles G. Treat, of the army Board of Ordnance and Fortifications, were the representatives of the War Department in the party. The Navy Department sent two admirals and several departmental chiefs. The tests will continue for a week. Old fortifications in the Bay of Mobile will be attacked by the fleet, and the results will be used in determination of guns to be recommended for other permanent coast defenses.
