  When will supposedly sensible people realize that learning does not
  necessarily imply or ensure upright living? It is true that more is to be
  expected of the so called educated man. But we are deceived right here. We are
  prone to think that a man is educated who becomes a veritable encyclopedia,
  even though he may be devoid of all true principle. Even supposing the man who
  “knows it all’? really has imbibed some religious knowledge, that is no sign
  that he will make it practical. For we find only too often from experience
  that knowledge is but a power wielded for destruction rather than
  construction. And that is because we are not educated to subjugate mind to
  conscience. —The Castle.
