<h1>Face Your Troubles</h1>

<p>FACE YOUR TROUBLES It was a very prominent and successful man in national affairs who said that, “very trouble that came his way he tried to make into an example to teach the better way to face a similar circumstances in the future. For in that way, I am sure to learn.” How simple and yet how true. When we come to look upon trouble as a great barrier, we are sure to develop a moral weakness and in time we drift into some haven of charity. And with the passing of a few years after our death those who recall us to mind will be but few in number. It may be an exaggeration to say that we should be on the outlook for trouble at any time, as it seems a part of the routine of life, and every day that passes by without contention is a surprise, as it leaves us without its attendant lesson, and I feel that something of disciplinary value to the mind is missing.</p>
