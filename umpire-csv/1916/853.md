BY AIR AND WIRE    An accidental experiment in the velocity of sound is recounted by a scientist attached to one of Uncle Samâ€™s bureaus at Washington.       He had gone to his telephone, and just as he put the receiver to his ear heard the click of another telephone. Another receiver had been removed and the line was open.       Then he heard through the telephone the shriek of a locomotive whistle, and a few seconds later the sound came through the open window in the usual way. Looking up, he saw a locomotive half a mile away, passing a government office. The telephone that was open was that at the government office, and the sound of the whistle had come through its transformation into an electric current quicker than it had traveled through the air.
