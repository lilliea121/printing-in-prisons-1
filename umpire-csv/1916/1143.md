THE TASK    By John Kendrick Bangs       The deed that I would do    Involves no valor of the sword,    That in one moment mad of rue    Should earn for me some rich reward,    And cause posterity to rear,    Where an admiring world might see,    To pierce the upper heavens clear,    A bronze or marble shaft to me;    But in some corner of some squalid way    Where misery shall lurk, to fight    To bring the sunshine of a joyous day   To dawn on souls oppressed by might;    To put unhappiness to flight,    And start    Some hopeless heart    Upon the road to hope; or where distress    Hath dwelt, by acts of tenderness    And words of courage, helpfulness, and cheer,    Drive out some mortalâ€™s fear,    And set him on his way to light.
