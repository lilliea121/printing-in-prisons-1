Cooks 6—Bakers 4      The Cooks put another crimp in the Bakers aspirations as leaders of the culinary department, when they again defeated the latter by the score of 6—4.   Big john for the Bakers, fanned 7 and passed 3.    Banks twirled for the Cooks fanning 5 and walking 2.    Jacoby and Jim fielded well for the Bakers while Big Bill and Morgan did the honors for the Cooks.    Umpires—Mack.
