THE INVENTOR Back of the anvil and hammer By which the metal is wrought, Back of the workshop’s clamor The seeker will find the thought, The thought that is ever master Of iron and steam and steel, That conquers all disaster And crushes it under heel. The drudges may fret and tinker And labor with lusty blows, But back of them stands the thinker— The practical man who knows; For into each plow or sabre, Each piece and part and whole, Must go the brains of labor, Which gives to the work a soul. Back of the motor’s humming, Back of the bells that ring, Back of the hammer’s drumming, Back of the cranes that swing, There is an eye which scans them Watching through stress and strain, There is a mind which planned them— Back of the brawn—the brain. Might of the roaring boiler, Force of the engine’s thrust, Strength of the sweating toiler, Greatly in these we trust; But back of them stands the thinker, The schemer who drives things through, Still back of them all is the dreamer Who made a dream come true. —Passaic News.
