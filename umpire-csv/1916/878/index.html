<p>USUALLY MEANS WAR A rather fine distinction has been drawn between the “severance of diplomatic relations” and a “declaration of war.” The distinct impression has been given to the public that the former course could he adopted without involving the latter, but as this question is apt to recur from time to time, it might be well to state the fact that diplomatic relations have never been severed, without war as a consequence. Moore’s Digest, one of the leading authorities on international law, sets forth not a single case where the severance of diplomatic relations has not been followed by war. It has been pointed out that diplomatic negotiations were broken off with Mexico. without the sequence of war This, however, is not true. Ambassador Henry Lane Wilson did not ask for his passports.
