EIGHT-HOUR DAY DISCUSSED BY OPERATORS AND MINERS From New York it is reported that the subcommittee of the anthracite operators and miners which met there recently discussed the demand for an eight-hour day in the hard coal fields. John P. White, president of the United Mine Workers, gave an interpretation of how he expected the eight-hour day to work if the anthracite operators granted this concession. The request of the miners embraced in their second demand covering a 20 per cent increase in wages, also occupied the attention of the conference. The minersâ€™ representatives contended that the increased cost of living was a serious problem for the men, as the purchasing power of their earnings was less now than in the past. They submitted statistics computed from date furnished by business men in the anthracite district, purporting to show increases in rents and other necessities of life. While no final agreement was reached on either question, it is believed that a satisfactory solution will soon be forthcoming.
