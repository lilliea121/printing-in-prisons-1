Friday’s Games   Ninth 12 —Shed 1      The Ninth won from the Shed by the score of 12 to 1 in a game that was minus all the essentials of a good ball game.    The heavy hitting of the Ninth and the pitching of Mac were the only redeeming features of the game.    This was Mac’s first game with the Ninth and he made a fine showing against his former team mates allowing only 3 hits and having 12 strike outs and walked two.   Williamsport pitched for the Shed; but was replaced in the 7th inning by Logan who allowed 6 hits in two inning.   Score by innings as follows:   R. H. E. Shed 0 0 1 0 0 0 0—1 3 2 Ninth 1 0 1 3 0 5 2—12 14 0   Home runs—Mac; Williamsport.   Doubles Yellow 2; Chick; Pet.   Umpires—Andy and Miller
