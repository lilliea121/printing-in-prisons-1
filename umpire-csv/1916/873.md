A TRUE FRIEND IN DEED       A writer in one of the current weeklies has taken up the cause of the friendless prisoners, in an effort to secure correspondence that may cheer and comfort him in his hour of trouble. In his letter to the editor he makes a plea for a greater extension of sympathy for the man behind stone walls, and says: “Ours is a generous-hearted country, and the sympathy of our people is easily aroused when cause of distress are made known to them, giving abundantly of their dollars.       There is a form of distress to which few give a thought, and for which the writer asks some the writer appeals in the cause of friendless ‘prisoners, to thing far more subtle than money. whom a word of sympathy and encouragement is more than all the dollars in the world: We all know how the so-called friends depart at the first sound of reverses and how quickly the world turns up its nose. Friends are good in prosperity, but who has not known the far greater value of a friend in adversity?       We are glad to note this spirit of kindly feeling toward the “grey brotherhood,” and sincerely trust that it may be productive of some real benefit to the needy. Much joy and happiness to this warmhearted sympathizer.
