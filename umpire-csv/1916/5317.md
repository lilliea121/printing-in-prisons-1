H. F. C. 10—Blocks 6      In a game of comedy baseball the Honor Club again won from the Blocks by the score of 10—6.   Big Slim and Rube were elected to do the twirling for the Honor Club and Mooney for the Blocks.    The pitchers on both sides were hit quite freely and it was a game of hit and run through out.
