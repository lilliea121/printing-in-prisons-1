  We may grow wrong, or allow ourselves to crystallize in habits that imply a
  loss of desire to do good; and at last having made up our minds not to strive
  for that which is worthy and to hate that which is evil, we are amazed that
  life seems to have lost its charm. But we should not be. For when we
  deliberately shut our eyes and our heart to the uplifting impulses of life, we
  deny the very laws of nature—of our divine nature.
