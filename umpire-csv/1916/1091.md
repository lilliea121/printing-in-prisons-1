NEVER!       No one is beat till he quits,    No one is through till he stops;    No matter how hard failure hits,    No matter how often he drops,    A fellow’s not down till he lies    In the dirt and refuses to rise.       Fate n.ay slam him and bang him around,    And batter his frame till he's sore;    But she never can say that he’s downed    While he bobs up serenely for more.    A fellow’s not dead till he dies,    Nor beat till no longer he tries. —Selected
