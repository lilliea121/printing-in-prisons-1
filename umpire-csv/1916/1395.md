VISIT FROM CAPTAIN CHARLES BOOTH      This institution was visited on Sunday last by Captain Charles Booth son of Mrs. Maud B. Booth, better known as the “Little Mother,” who brought a message of cheer and hope to the inmates. Captain Booth addressed the men on the several blocks in a few well chosen and forceful remarks laying stress on the necessity for those in confinement to help themselves by a change of mental attitude and a determination to live an upright life in the future.       Captain Booth’s stay with us was necessarily short, owing to the press of his many duties in connection with the Volunteers of America. The men were much pleased at his visit and wished to hear more about the splendid work being carried on by the Volunteers.       Captain Booth expressed regret at the shortness of time at his disposal and left with the promise of another visit in the near future.
