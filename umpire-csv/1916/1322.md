THE LARGEST NAVAL GUN       There are many stories afloat about big guns, but the largest naval gun in commission on a warship is the 15-inch piece mounted on the Queen Elizabeth and her class. Next in size is the 14-inch gun mounted in our own and the Japanese Navy.       The largest gun reliably known to be mounted in the German navy is the 12-inch piece. However, among the many rumors regarding the German naval developments is one to the effect that a 17-inch naval gun is being mounted on the latest German battleships. The story that earlier ships are being armed with a 17inch gun may be set down as a canardâ€”the thing simply cannot be done. The big gun movement is active and will persist for some time.
