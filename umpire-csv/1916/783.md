HE GOT THE RAISE The diminutive office boy had worked hard on a salary of two dollars a week. He was a subdued little chap, faithful and quiet. Finally, just before the New Year, he plucked up courage enough to ask for an increase.“How much more would you like?” inquired his employer. “Well,” answered the lad, “I don’t think fifty cents more a week would be too much.” “You are rather a small boy to be earning two dollars and a half a week.” “I know I am small,” he replied, ‘but, to tell the truth, since I’ve worked here I’ve been so busy I haven’t had time to grow.” He got the raise.
