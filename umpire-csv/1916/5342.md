Ninth 7—Shed 2Moony’s unsteadiness with poor fielding by the Shed team at critical times, and some exceptionally timely hitting by the Ninth, enabled them to win by the score of 7 to 2. Moony was replaced in the 7th stanza by 5 Banks, 8 strikes outs and 6 passes were recorded off the pairMack was pitched the full game for the Ninth, had excellent control, and was never in difficult, fanning 9, and passed none.Inability to hit with men on base proved costly to the Shed. Score by innings as follows:R H E. Shed 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0—2 4 3 Ninth 2 1 1 0 1 1 1 0—7 8 1Two base hits—Wmsp’t; Mack.Umpires—Fred and Frank.
