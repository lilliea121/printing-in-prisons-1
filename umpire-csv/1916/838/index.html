<p>H. &amp; F. CLUB NOTES An entire new program will replace that of the past six weeks, beginning this Saturday, and there will be surprises galore for the members of the Club, as all of the acts are entirely original, and: the various talent have been practicing very hard to make them a success.This week the 1st Block, 8th Block and 4th Gallery go out, and we want to impress on you again the importance of bringing your ticket, as a number of our members have forgotten them recently and it results in a lot of confusion at the door, which otherwise would be avoided. Any member losing his ticket hereafter will not be supplied with another, nor will he be admitted to the hall unless the ticket is produced. After the performance the men should leave the hall quietly and fall in line promptly in columns of twos and return at once to their respective. Blocks and Galleries. Give your line a military appearance. Do not string out or bunch up in threes or fours, but return in a soldiery manner, as it looks much better when crossing the Centre.
