WORLD’S RECORD BROKEN    George Timlin, a Philadelphia blacksmith, smashed the world’s record by making 12 dozen horseshoes in 3 hours; 14 minutes and 50 seconds. The record, set by Joseph L. Apt, had been the same number of shoes in 4 hours, 49 minute: and 2 ½ seconds. The contest took place in the shop of Louis Alaeck, and was witnessed: by a large gathering. Timlin began his record work at 7 o’clock in the morning.
