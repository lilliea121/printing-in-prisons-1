THE UMPIRE THE CAPE COD CANAL    Since the opening of the Cape Cod Canal, nearly 3000 vessels have passed through this waterway, including several Government ships. Thus the submarines K-5 and K-6 made the passage by way of the canal from Boston to Newport, at the rate of eleven miles an hourâ€”a Government test which must be looked upon as most successful. The eight-mile trip through the canal was made in 45 minutes, and by using this passage the submarines saved sixty miles of distance and avoided much rough weather. The Kiel Canal was built by the Germans at a cost approaching $100,000,000, mainly for strategic purpose; yet it is a fact that the reduction of distance between the Germans base in the Baltic and the North Sea, by this canal is little greater than the gain to the American fleet, which would result from the enlargement of the Cape Cod Canal to accommodate our battleships, between those two important strategic centers, Newport and Boston.
