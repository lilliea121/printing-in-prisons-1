GREAT CONVENTION OF ADVERTISING MEN       Begining Saturday last and continuing until Monday, a vast multitude of delegates poured into this city from the four corners of the earth, to attend the annual convention of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the world. It is estimated that over 10,000 delegates are in town this week, not to mention a host of others who came as invited guests.       The opening exarcises took place at the Metropolitan Opera House on Sunday afternoon, with an address by the Hon. Frank R. Lane, Secretary of the Interior, which was followed by other able speakers on various topics of interest.       The Poor Richard Club orchestra, composed of some fifty members of the Philadelphia Orchestra, furnished the music for the occasion, and a chorus of 150 voices added their melody to the festivities.       It is announced that 100 crates of peaches, were distributed along Broad street during the parade Monday night by the Boosters Club, an organization of commission merchants, which took part in the parade.       A general program was arranged for the advertising men which will keep them on the jump during their stay in Philadelphia, and from all accounts the occasion will be considered the most replete with unusual novelties for edification and amusements that has ever been accomplished.
