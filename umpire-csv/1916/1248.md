SONG OF THE UNDISMAYED   By Berton Barley      Life, you have harried and hurt and scourged me   Mocked me cruelly through the years.    Under a burden of woe submerged me    Sought to fright me with pain and tears.   Fortune and glory me—and took away   Yet, for all of the years you’ve tried me,   Dauntless I sing to the world today.      For out of the wreck of a vanished passion   Out of the failure, the doubt, the pain,    Out of the sorrow and death I’ll fashion   Many a song in a fearless strain,   And the songs I make shall have no savor   Of useless longing or vain regret,   Aud I shall carol to make men braver   For every trial that must be me?      Failure, defeat, despair—I know them   But still I challenge then, unafraid,   And men shall overthrow them   Perchance before of a song I’ve made;   Life, through my peace and my joy be taken   Through all my visions and dreams go by,   I’ll lift my voice in a tone unshaken    And keep on singing until I die!
