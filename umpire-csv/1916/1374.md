SIDESTEP THE DOUBTER      The story is told of how a small group of small men collected togather in a small corner grocery store, out in the country, where the roads formed a junction to the main highway leading to the city. There they discussed and cussed many things and subjects.       These wiseacres said that Fulton was a sure enough fool—that he couldn’t do it; only a dreamer or a half-wit would ever think of making a boat go up stream with a mere rattle-box machine.      After much more talk of a similar nature the boat started up the Hudson, and the natives all said in chorus: “Well by heck, he’s gone and done it.” And so it is even now. Every day some thinker lays out a way, and then then some doer paves the way to success.       Along the street curb in the citys you may see a number of idlers standing about, and finding fault with the way they pave the road to success. Probably there are many of these doubters to be found within prison walls, as we constantly hear the foolish arguments advanced against personal rehabitition; but there skeptical reasoners only serve to give additional impulse to the man capable of thinking right—to profit by past mistakes.
