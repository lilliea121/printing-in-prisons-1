Warden Kirchway Makes New Rule To Bar Newspaper Men From Execution Chamber    Warden Kirchway established a new rule at executions, by the excluding of newspaper men from the death chamber, when two prisoners were electrocuted at Sing Sing, the other day. Warden Kirchway, who is opposed to the death penalty, took the position that as he was opposed to capital punishment he did not care to advertise it any more than necessary, as it had a very depressing effect upon the prisoners and others who read the newspapers.
