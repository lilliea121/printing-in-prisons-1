<p>BALL GAMES OF THE WEEK Tuesday’s Games Printers 13—Ninth 2 Misplays were largely responsible for the Ninth defeat at the hands of the Printers. Hagy, preformed in real ‘Alexander’ style, holding the Ninth to 3 hits, while his teammates were pounding Charley for 16 hits. The heavy artillery of the Printers hammered Charley hard; being replaced by Mac in the 5th frame, who tried hard to win a losing game. Slats, the first string catcher for the Printers, played a good game at the initial sack. Clever fielding by Jacoby and Jack former Shed manager featured. Score by innings as follows: R. H. E. Printers 2 0 0 5 6 0 0 0—13 16 1 Ninth 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1—2 3 0Home Run—Lefty.Doubles—Hagy 3; Slats; Jim; Buck. Umpire Jack. Cubs 4 —Shed 3 In a pitchers battle the Cubs won from the Shed by the score of 4 to 3. Moony of the Cubs struck out 14 of the 24 Shed batters that faced him, and did not allow a single hit, but walked four. Logan for the Shed allowed only two hits, walked 2, and three strike outs. The game was well played throughout, but many poor decisions by the Umpire tended to lessen the interest of the game “Happy’ of the Shed, started the spectators in the 6th inning by successfully stealing home. Score by innings as follows: R.
