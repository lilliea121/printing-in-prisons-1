Ninth 5—Printers 1       Timely hitting by the Ninth coupled with classy fielding support, spelled defeat for the Printers 5—1.       The Printers scored their lone tally in the second frame when Hagy scored on Slats sacrifice hit.       Jacoby the “Printers Star,” appeared in the line-ups today, but was disabled in the early part of the game when he had a bad fall.       Stump fielding spectacularly, and looked like a real second base-man.       Mac, Pettrili and Charlie led the Ninth attack.       Winters struck out 7, and walked 4. Charlie fanned 9, and passed 2.       Score by innings as follows:       R. H. E. Ninth 0 0 0 3 2 0 0 0 0—5 7 1 Printers 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0—1 5 1      Triples—Mack; Hagy.       Doubles—Charley; Pet; Jack.       Umpires—Marty and Harmon.
