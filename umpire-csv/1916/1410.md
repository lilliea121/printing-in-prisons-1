It pays to show a manly spirit when the occasion arises. At last so it proved in the case of Frank Canning, of Clarksboro, N. J., who recently received a fortune of $200,000, left to him by a Detroit, Mich., woman who died some time ago.       It appears that at some previous time the woman was visiting in the East and while riding in a street-car she was made the subject of a number of coarse jests by a crowd of loafers who were in the car. This proved too much for Canningâ€™s manhood to stand, so he sailed into the crowd and after throwing off two of their number, forced the others to desist. For that act he has just received a splendid reward.
