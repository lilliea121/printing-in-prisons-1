NOW BUILDING A SHIP EVERY DAY It is announced that United States shipyards are now building a new ship every day. It is a record never before equaled in our country and is the sequel to our stupendous exports at a time when world commerce is upset by a world war. There are now under course of construction or contracted for, 268 steel vessels, the aggregate of whose tonnage exceds 1,129,0C0. Ships bearing the Stars and Stripes have more than doubled since the war began, and the increase is still going on at high tide. Prior to August, 1914, less than a tenth of Americaâ€™s foreign commerce was carried in American ships; but at the present rate of building new ones the period following the end of war will see a totally different storp. The business of transporting over five billions of exports and imports is a trade worth going after and keeping after till we get it.
