Look For The Good    “Keep the attitude divinely optimistic all the time. Endeavor to read and see the good quality in every man you meet or deal with. Believe that God is no respecter of persons. Believe that he loves you as much as any other man that ever lived. Be not persuaded by any appearance that you are the “underdog.” In the mind of God there is no inferiority. The Divine Idea is perfect.”
