E. S. P. BAND CONCERT ON THE CENTER       The Fourth of July was appropriately observed at this institution by a well arranged program of musical selections, which was rendered by the E.S.

Professor A. F. Wiegandt clearly evinced his ability as a leader, by the fine work of the band in the rendition of the various selections which are given below:       Program Entry March Hall 2nd Regiment M.
