<p>CHARACTERISTICS OF WASHINGTON As a fitting tribute to the memory of George Washington, whose birthday anniversary: will be celebrated on the twenty second of this month, it is most worthy of mention that to the appointment of Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental army, more than to any other single circumstance, is due the ultimate success of the American Revolution. He was punctual, methodical, and exact in the highest degree, excelled in managing those minute details which are so essential to the efficiency of an army, and he possessed to an eminent degree not only the common courage of a soldier, but also that rarer form of courage which can endure long-continued suspense, bear the weight of great responsibility, and encounter the risks of misrepresentation and unpopularity. For several years, and usually in the neighborhood of superior forces, he commanded a perpetually fluctuating army, nearly destitute of discipline and respect for authority, torn by violent personal and provincial jealousies, wretchedly armed and clothed, and sometimes in imminent danger of starvation. “Unsupported for the most part by the population among whom he was quartered, and incessantly thwarted by* the jealousy of Congress, he kept his army together by a combination of skill, firmness, patience, and judgment which has rarely been surpassed, and he led it at last to a signal triumph. In civil as in military life he was preeminent among his contemporaries for the clearness and soundness of his judgment, for his moderation and self-control, for the quiet dignity and the indomitable firmness with which he pursued every path which he had deliberately chosen. Of all the great men in history he was the most invariably judicious, and there is scarcely a rash word or judgment recorded of him.” Those who knew him well noticed that he had keen sensibilities and strong passions; but his power of self command never failed him, and no act of his public life can be traced to personal caprice, ambition, or resentment. In the depression of many failures, in the elation of success, at times when his soldiers were deserting by hundreds and when malignant plots were formed against his reputation, amid the constant quarrels, rivalries, and jealousies of his subordinates, in the dark hour of national ingratitude, and in the midst of the most universal and intoxicating flattery, he was always the same calm, wise, just, and single-minded man, pursuing the course which he believed to be right without fear or favor or fanaticism; equally free from the passions that spring from interest, or imagination. ‘He never acted on the impulse of an absorbing or uncalculating enthusiasm, and he valued very highly fortune, position, and reputation; but at the command of duty he was ready to risk and sacrifice them all. He was, in the highest sense of the words, a gentleman and a man of honor, and he carried into public life the severest standard of private morals. It was at first the constant dread of large sections of the American people that if the old Government were overthrown they would fall into the hands of military adventurers and undergo the yoke of military despotism It was mainly the transparent integrity of the character of Washington that dispelled the fear. It was always known by his friends and it was soon acknowledged by the whole nation, and by the English themselves, that in Washington, America had found a leader who could. be induced by no earthly motive to tell a falsehood or to break an engagement or to commit any dishonorable act.” Men of this moral type are rare, and there is scarcely another instance in history of such a man having reached and maintained the highest position in the convulsions of civil war and of a great popular agitation.</p>
