FINE PROGRAM OF SONG       Under the auspices of the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, the Ladies of San Domingo Choral, rendered a splendid Song Service on the Center, at this institution on Sunday last.       Those who had the pleasure to be present at the service were loud in their praise of the singing.       The next visit of these sweet singers will be looked forward to with pleasant anticipation.       The anniversary of Lincolnâ€™s birthday will be celebrated by a Band Concert on the Center.
