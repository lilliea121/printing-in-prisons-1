SUNDAY SONG SERVICE       The inmate choirs and Orchestra gave a well rendered Song Service on the Centre, at this institution on Sunday afternoon fast. The program was well selected and the soloistâ€™s in song and at the piano did well, adding to the completeness of the musical numbers.       All the men were glad to see the Chaplain again after his recent sickness, and listened with rapt attention to his interesting and instructive remarks at the close of the service.       Many visitors were present on the occasion, all of whom were replete in their praise of the pleasing event       It is reported that Prof. Wiegandt has made preparations for an extra fine Song Service on Easter Sunday.
