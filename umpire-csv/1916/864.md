UPKEEP OF ARMY AND NAVY BY NEW PLAN    Congressman Davis Would “Make Money Fight For Its Country”       Representative “Cyclone Davis,”?. member at large from the State of Texas, introduced a bill in the House to “make money fight for its country the same as men.” Mr. Davis is an opponent of the preparedness program. The Davis plan is that each corporation in the United States shall be counted as an individual and be forced to pay the cost of the upkeep of one or more soldiers or sailors. For each $50, 000 of capital and surplus above $250,000 the corporation shall support one sailor or soldier. In time of war a corporation must support one soldier or sailor for each $25,000 above a capital and surplus of $75,000.       Mr. Davis has also devised a graduated scale for the payment of upkeep sums by persons and families with large incomes. Inheritances, dowries and foreign investments in America must, in effect, adopt a soldier or sailor in the United States forces provided the inheritances, dowries or incomes from foreign investments here exceed $50,000.       The Texan proposes that those who violate the law shall be treated as deserters and shot in wartime.
