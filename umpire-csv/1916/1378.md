THE RIVER OF LIFEOn the river of life, as I float along,I see with the Spirit’s sightThat many a nauseous weed of wrongHas root in a seed of right.For evil is goof that has gone astray,And sorrow is only blindness,And the world is always under the swayOf a changeless law of kindness.The commonest error a truth can make Is shouting its sweet voice hoarse,And sin is only the soul’s mistakeIn misdirecting its force.And love, the fairest of all fair thingsThat ever to man descended,Grows rank with nettles and poisonous thingsUnless it is watched and tended.There could not be anything better than thisOld world in the way it began, And though some matters have gone amiss From the great original plan;And however dark the skies may appear, And however souls may blunder,I tell you it all will work out clear, For good lies over and under.—Selected
