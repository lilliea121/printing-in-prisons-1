Monday’s GamesPrinters 5—Shed 1Unable to solve the shoots and curves of Slats, the Printers’ utility man, the Shed fell an easy prey to the Printers 5 to 1. Jim scored the Sheds only run in the fourth frame on his terrific drive over the fifth block, for the circuit. That old “soup bone” of Slats is working nicely, and he should come through this season with a fine record. He fanned 7, and passed 2. Herb for the Shed struck out 3 and passed 4. Score by innings as follows: R. H. E. Shed 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0—1 1 1 Printers 1 0 0 1 1 2 0 0 0—5 6 0 Home run—Jim. Umpires—Marty and Andy.
