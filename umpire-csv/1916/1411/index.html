They all say that a good laugh is healthful. I know better.” “Been experimenting?” “Yes.

Is he crazy?” “I guess so,” said his friend hurriedly, “Let’s hurry on. I don’t want to meet him.” “Why not?” “He may recognize this umbrella. It’s his.”Claude had been promised a motor ride with his father, and his mother had sent him upstairs to get ready. As he came down his mother asked: “Have you washed your face, Claude?” “Yes’m,” answered the boy. “And your hands?” queried the mother. “Yep,” said Claude. “And your neck?” persisted the mother. “Oh, see here, Mother,” said the boy, in disgust, “I ain’t no angel!”</p>
