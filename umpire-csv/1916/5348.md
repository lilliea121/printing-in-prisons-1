Thursday’s Games    Printers 9—Shed 5       The Shed started after the Printers in whirlwind fashion, scoring 8 runs in the 1st and 2nd inning, but were unable to hold the lead losing out by the score of 9—5.       Banks lor the Shed, pitched good ball until the 5th inning, then the Printers got their heavy hitting machine working and seored 7 runs, Banks then gave way to Moony, who fared little better, their being 7 hits recorded? between the pair, and 4 strike-outs.       Big Slim was on the mound for the Printers, allowing only 3 hits, and struck out 7.       The game was exciting and was marked by many disputes over decisions rendered by the Umpire.       Score by innings as follows:       R. H. E. Printers 0 0 1 1 7 0 0 0—9 7 4 Shed 0 1 2 0 1 1 0 0—5 3 2        Home run—Jack       Doubles—Banks; Slats; Stump.       Umpires Slim and Andy.
