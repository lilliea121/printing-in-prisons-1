U.S. TROOPS WELL ADVANCED INTO MEXICO    Villain Rapid Flight to His Former Stronghold       From Army Headquarters at San Antonio, Texas, it was learned that U.S. troops are now well advanced into Mexico in two columns.       General Pershing’s column, it is understood, is now many miles from its point of entry into Mexico, and Colonel Dodd’s faster-moving troopers are far from the American border. Four aeroplanes, which crossed near Palomas will do scout duty on the march.       It is intended that the more mobile force of Colonel Dodd should effect a juncture with the first column after which Colonel Dodd’s cavalry would be sent on reconnaissance, utilizing also the services of American cowboys who have joined the column, together with other scouts.       It is reported that the country through which the troops are now moving, is so desolate and almost uninhabited that attack either by Villa or by insubordinate Government troops at any moment would occasion no surprise.
