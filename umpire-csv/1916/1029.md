THE BRIGHTER DAWNING   By Martha Shepard Lippincott      Although the world is full of trouble,   Keep looking for the brighter day;   When clouds of sorrow will be passing   And peace and joy will come our way,   Around the clouds will silver linings   Be shining so that we may see    The brighter dawning for the morrow,   For mankind will surely be.   There ne’er in life will be a night-time   So dark but day will follow soon;   No winter-time so cold and drear   But afterwhile will come sweet June.   And so in life there is no sorrow   But what will sometime pass away   With some bright dawning there’ll be coming   Around for you, a brighter day.
