A SPLENDID EXAMPLE      The story is told of General Charles G. Gordon, the famous English government sought to reward him for his splendid service in China, he declined all money and titles but accepted a gold medal on which his name and a record of his thirty-three engagements were inscribed. After his death the medal was not to be found among his possessions. Later it was learned that he had sent it to Manchester during a famine at that place, with a request that it should be melted and used to buy bread for the city’s poor.      In his diary on that day he had written:       “The last and only thing I had in this world that I truly valued, for I have given all to the Lord.” This love, which passeth worldly knowledge, constrained him to give up his most cherished possession for the relief of others.      Truly this is a clear insight unto a splendid character, well worthy of emulation by all who strive to do good and help their “fellow man.”
