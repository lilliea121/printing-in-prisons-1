PRISON LABOR TO PROFIT BY $75,000 FUND    A late report from Harrisburg states that Attorney General Brown has given an opinion to the new State Prison Labor Commission that it may draw upon a $75,000 appropriation made to it under the name of the “manufacturing Fund,” for operation of the new prison labor system by which convicts will be paid for their labor. A question had been raised by the Auditor General whether the act could be construed to carry such appropriation.       A meeting of S. P. L. Commission is expected to take place shortly, when the wage schedule will be decided upon.
