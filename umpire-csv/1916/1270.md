TO DISSIPATE FOG BY ELECTRICITYThe Smithsonian Institution announces in its last annual report that it has made an appropriation to further experiments in the dissipation of fog by electricity, and that the investigations will be carried out under the general direction of Dr. F. G. Cottrell, who has already done much toward the practical precipitation of dust, smoke and chemical fumes in large industrial establishments. As every reader of the “Scientific American” knows, the idea of dispersing fog by electrical methods has been before the public for a number of years, though it appears never to have reached the stage of feasibility, on a commercial scale. The subject has recently aroused fresh attention, particularly in the neighborhood of San Francisco, through researchers planned by the University of California, in co-operation with the United States Lighthouse Service. The American Institute of Electrical Engineers has also appointed a committee to co-operate in this work. According to the Smithsonian report, the essential element to success seems to be some form of electrical apparatus of very high direct voltage, with facilities for its control and ready application.
