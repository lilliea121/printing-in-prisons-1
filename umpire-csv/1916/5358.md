Monday’s Games    Cubs—10 Shed—3       The Cubs hammered Banks hard and defeated the Shed by a score of 10—3.       Boyd, who twirled the full game for the Cubs, had excellent control, he allowed 3 hits, fanned 5, and passed 1.       Banks for the Shed did not fare so well, allowing 13 hits, fanned 6 and passed 7.       Albie did some classy maneuvering in the inner garden, a clever catch by him was the outstanding feature.       Score by innings as follows:       R. H. E. Shed 0 1 0 0 2 0 0 0—3 3 1 Cubs 2 1 2 0 4 1 0  0—10 10 0      Home runs—Beck, Evans.       Doubles— Pidge, Barney, Ginger.
