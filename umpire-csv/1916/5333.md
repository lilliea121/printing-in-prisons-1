Printers 2—Ninth 1      The Printers won a hard fought game from the Ninth by the score of 2—1.   It was a pitchers battle from the start, between Jacoby for the Printers and Jimmy Winters for the Nitnth.   The Printers took the lead from the start and managed to hold it to the finish; but things looked doubtful in the 6th inning when the Ninth had a man on 2nd and 3rd base with only one out; but Jacoby tightened up and kept them from scoring.    Jimmy for the Ninth allowed only 1 hit and struck out 5, Jacoby allowed 2 hits and struck out 10.   Score by innings as follows:   R. H. E. Ninth 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0—1 2 2 Printers 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0—2 1 1   Two base hits—Sox; Jim, Buck.   Triple Hagy.   Umpires, —Fred and Frank.
