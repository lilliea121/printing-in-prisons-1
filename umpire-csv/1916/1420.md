IT IS REPORTED THAT JAPAN SEEKS WAR WITH U. S. War Vessels and Transports Are Being Rushed at all Shipyards, it is Declared A New York report states that according to Andrew D. Browne, a wealthy tea planter from the East Indies, who recently sailed for that port for Liverpool, Japan is preparing for war with the United States, and the subject is discussed daily by the people and in the local news papers as a thing that is to happen in the near future. “The shipyards of Japan are working day and night,” Mr. Browne said, ‘turning out warships at a speed that is remarkable to those who know the Japan of 25 or 30 years ago. In addition, the two big steamship companies, the Toyo Kissen Kaisha and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, are building steamships which can be used as troop transports or for carrying stores. It is common talk about an immediate seizure of the Philippine Islands, and giving aid to the Mexicans. In addition, they talk of annexing the fertile islands of Sumatra and Java, now owned by the Dutch. They consider the the Dutch could not help themselves under the present circumstances and that Japan could thus acquire valuable territory.
