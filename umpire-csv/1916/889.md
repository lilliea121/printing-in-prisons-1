COLORADO’S EXECUTIVE OVERRULED BY ASS’T GOVERNOR       It has recently leaked out that Mrs. Geo. A. Carlson, wife of the Governor of Colorado, has asserted her prerogative as “Assistant Governor.” Despite the desire of her husband and John Vivian, patronage dispenser of the — administration, to remove Thomas Tynan, reform warden of the State Penitentiary, “Assistant Governor’? Carlson has said Warden Tynan shall stay, and stay he has.       The Warden became a national figure through inaugurating the ‘honor system” in penal institutions. Shortly after the Carlson administration went into office Mrs. Carlson announced she thought a woman’s place was by her husband’s side and she would be ‘Assistant Governor “ Then one day the Governor told her he had decided to replace Tynan, with A. C. Dutcher, a Republican. The Governor went to his office, where Vivian and Dutcher awaited the plum.’ The Governor was about to sign the appointment of Dutcher when “Assistant Governor” Carlson said:       “You shall not remove Warden Tynan. That is my appointment.       “Very well, my dear,” said the Governor. Vivian and Dutcher filed out of the office.
