THE CUP OF LIFE By Alice Dooley Oh, what is life worth if ‘tis not for another? When we dip in the deep well of life for a draft If the cup is not held to the lips of a brother ‘Twill change into bitterness while it is quaffed. Drink deep, then; begrudge not your soul its full measure Of happiness; sing like a bird if you’re gay. But whether you’re happy or sorrowful, treasure The chance to give happiness, just for a day.
