THE CHILD IN THE GARDEN    Henry Van Dyke      When to the garden of untroubled thought,    I came of late, and saw the open door,    And wished again to enter, and explore   The sweet, wild ways with stainless bloom in wrought,   And bowers of innocence with beauty fraught,   It seemed some purer voice must speak before   I dared to tread hat garden loved of yore,   That Eden lost unknown and found unsought.   Then, just within the gate I saw a child,—   A strangerchild, yet to my heart most dear, —   Whi held his hands to me, and softly smiled    With eyes that knew no shade of sin or fear:   “Come in,” he said, “and play awhile with me;   I am the little child you used to be.”
