REPRESENTATIVE VARE TO THE FRONT FOR NAVY YARD CRANE A late report from Washington, states that Representative William S. Vare, of Phila., has recently introduced a bill in the house to provide for an appropriation of $500,000 for construction of a floating crane of the receiver type at League Island, to handle adequately heavy guns, gun equipment, engines and boilers for battleships. The bill is expected to pass the House without serious opposition.
