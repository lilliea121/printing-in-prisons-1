Ninth 8—Shed 3      The Shed team offered feeble opposition to the hard-hitting Ninths who defeated them 8 to 3.    Jim Winters for the Ninth was in fine shape, and with good support in back of him, the Sheds were helpless.   Winters allowed but 2 hits, while he fanned 5, and passed 6.    Herb for the Shed gave 7 hits, fanned 5, and walked 3.    Score by innings as follows:   R. H. E. Shed 0 0 1 0 0 2 0 0—3 2 1 Ninth 1 0 4 2 1 0 0 0—8 7 0    Doubles— Mac; Winters.    Umpires—Slim and Frank.
