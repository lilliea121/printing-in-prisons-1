THE PURPOSE OF LIFE    Abba Goold Woolson    Courage, brave soul! The ledgy pathway yonder,    O’er windy slopes, will lead to meadows sweet;    Turn not aside, nor let thy glances wander    To find a smoother turfage for thy feet.    True to thine aim, still journey on undaunted,    Led by the stars that beckon overhead;    With mind intent, thy footsteps, firmly planted,    Shall crush to even line the stones they tread.    The birds that circle o’er the sedgy hollows,    The coming tides, that backward sweep and roll,    Each has its purpose, and in wisdom follows    The devious. ways that bring it to its goal.    Theirs to renew the quest with every morning,    But thine to mount serener heights than they;    To seek the truth, all baser pleasures scorning,    Holding thy course where honor points the way.    Nor rest thee there; the gain is won for others;    Thy firmer poise must steady those who fall;    To higher levels lift thy weaker brothers;    God gave thy powers because he needs them all
