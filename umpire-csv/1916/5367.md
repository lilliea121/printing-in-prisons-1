Wednesday’s Games    Printers—2 Shed—2       The Printers and Shed battled 8 innings, and the game ended in a tie with 2 runs a piece.       There was sure some good ball-playing on both sides, but poor decisions of the umpire took out much interest in the game.       Silly, on the mound for the Shed was wild at times, passing 5 men, generally tightened up in pinches, and held the Printers to 2 hits and fanned 11.       Hagy allowed 4 hits, struck out 10 and walked 1.      Score by innings as follows:       R. H. E. Shed 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0—2 4 0 Printers 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0—2 2 2       Triple— Evans.
