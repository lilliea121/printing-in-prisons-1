Osborne Again Made Warden Of Sing Sing Prison        On Friday last, George W. Kirchwey tendered his resignation as warden of Sing Sing Prison to James M. Carter, State Superintendent of Prisons.       Mr. Carter immediately reappointed Thomas M. Osborne to fill the position; thus completing Mr. Osbornes victory over his enemies, who tried in every way to dislodge him from public esteem. “And there was much joy in Sing Sing over one warden that returneth.”
