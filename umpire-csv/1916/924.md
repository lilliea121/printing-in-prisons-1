SEE NO EVIL, HEAR NO EVIL, SPEAK NO EVIL   Grace McCowan Cook      How shall I see no evil?   As the sun on the filthy pool divining    Naught but the glow of its own clean shining   So shall you see no evil?      How shall I hear no evil?   As the lark in the blue, toward heaven wining      Hears only the sound of its clear singing,   So shall you hear no evil.      How shall I speak no evil?   “As thyself, thy neighbour” such loving kindness,      Will bring the holy deafness and blindness—   And dumbness—to speak no evil.
