TRY AGAIN       You’ve lost! I know—your scheme has failed and things are seeming blue. The future’s rosy look has gone. You don’t know what to do. Well, listen Bill. The schemes that win are only two in ten. Tomorrow may be brighter, boy. Buck up and try again. You had a million in your grasp; or was a girl the prize? And now you think the world is full of just deceit and lies. Conditions such as yours aren't new. They’re faced by many men. Tomorrow may be brighter, boy. Buck up and try again. If all schemes we figure out were winners life would pale and soon we’d all be trying hard to keep from going stale. Don’t lose your temper over it like some old fool wet hen. Tomorrow may be brighter boy. Buck up and try again. You’ve lost! I know—your scheme has failed and things are seeming blue, but there is no reason why the next should not go blooming through. This good old saw’s the best I know from any tongue or pen; “Tomorrow may be brighter, boy!. Buck up and try again.”    —Bide Dudley
