<h1>The Frame-Up of Osborne</h1>

<img width="200" src="/printing-in-prisons/assets/img/" />
<p>THE FRAME-UP OF OSBORNE An eastern paper in commenting editorially on the frame-up of Thomas Mott Osborne, has very aptly expressed its opinion as follows: Warden Osborne may have been a failure as the head of the New York State prison at Sing Sing. The general public certainly does not think so, but it sometimes happens that the public does not size up a man correctly for a time, although in the long run its judgments are pretty sound and sane However, it may be that Osborne was a misfit at Sing Sing. But it will probably take more than the present “frame-up” in New York to convince the public that it is wrong. The trouble with the so-called “investigation” of Osborne is that everybody could see, from the start, that the investigators were out “get” the warden of Sing Sing. The ”frame-up” was too plain for the public to make much mistake about it. No matter what the testimony, the investigators wanted to twist it to something to the warden’s discredit. Whitman needed some sort of an excuse before he was willing to dismiss the warden. He wanted to please the politicians, but he did not care to make too barefaced a job of Osborne’s political execution. So the “investigation” furnished the excuse.</p>
