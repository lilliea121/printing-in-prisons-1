EASTER MONDAY'S E.S. P. BAND CONCERT The E. S. P. band was at its best on Easter Monday afternoon in giving a well selected program of music on the Center. Prof. A. F. Wiegandt seems tireless in his efforts to bring the band up to the highest standard. It is to be noted that the members of the organization are as earnest in their efforts to improve the quality of their music as possible, which speaks well for the beneficial results of training under Prof. Wiegandt. There was a large number of visitors present at the concert, all of whom expressed their pleasure with the selections and tonal quality of the music. No less pleased was Warden McKenty, whose smile was ample evidence of his approbation.
