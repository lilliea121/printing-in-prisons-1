TORPEDOS BY AEROPLANE Sky Pilot to Guide The Radio Torpedo From Any Height above The Water It is announced that wireless control from an aeroplane of a coast defense torpedo has been developed it was learned recently, and patents for the scheme are included. in the Hammond radio-controlled torpedo, right for the purchase of which the Navy Department “has asked Congress to appropriate nearly a million dollars. Aeroplane control, navy officers explain, make it possible for the operator to guide the radio torpedo through the compressed air motor of the torpedo giving him a certain guide by which to steer it against a ship’s hull. By use of powerful glasses it has been possible heretofore to control the torpedo from shore to a distance of nearly 10,000 yards, but the aeroplane device will now make the missile effective to the full range of its motor capacity, or even far at sea if the torpedo is launched from a swift motorboat within sight of an enemy’s ship. The Hammond plans are now before the House Fortification Committee, which will continue its detailed consideration of the proposal to spend more than $80,000,(.00 on improving the coast defense within the next four years. Brigadier-General Kingman, Chief of Engineers, and Lieutenant-Colonel Winslow, of the Engineer Corps, were before the committee, their statements dealing with various schemes to add 16-inch guns with an all-round fire to the major part of the defense. They disclosed that one of the belligerent nations of Europe has developed a 17-inch gun for land use, but no details of its constructions of performance have been obtained here.
