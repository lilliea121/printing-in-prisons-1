Bishop Garland Returns Much Improved in HealthThe Episcopal inmates will be glad to learn that the Rt. Rev. Thomas J. Garland, Bishop Suffragan of the Protestant Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania, who confirmed a large class at the E. S. P. Chapel last fall, returned to the city last week after a six monthsâ€™ leave of absence spent in New Mexico and California. Mrs. Garland accompanied him. The Bishop said his health had improved and that he was ready to resume his duties.
