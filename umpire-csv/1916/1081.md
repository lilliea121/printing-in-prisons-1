BRUMBAUGH RECEIVES BRIEF VISIT FROM TAFT      From a Harrisburg report it is learned that former President Taft was one of the few persons who saw Governor Brumbaugh. The former President had an hour to spend between trains Monday afternoon on his way to Mercersburg, and he strolled through Capital Park unattended, to call on the Governor. The Governor had spent only a short time on the Hill today, and Mr. Taft saw him at the Executive Mansion. He spent half an hour with the Governor, in which time they talked over the political situation of the leading parties.
