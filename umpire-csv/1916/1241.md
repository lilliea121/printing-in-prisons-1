AN INTERCHANGE OF AIRMEN      According to a recent statement in “Lee Martin,” there is to be a meeting of the Aaglo-French aviation corps chiefs once a month at Paris. The meeting will be attended by representatives of the other allies, in order that unity of direction may obtain in the air service of the Entente nations. Carrying out the plan still further, Russian aviators will be sent to France for instruction and French instructors will got to Russia. Since the beginning of the war, continues the editorial comment, France has furnished her allies with one-fifth of her output of aeroplanes and one-third of the motors she has produced.
