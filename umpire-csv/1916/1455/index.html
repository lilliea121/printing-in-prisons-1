<h1>Progress In Prison Legislation</h1>

<p>PROGRESS IN PRISON LEGISLATION In the state legislative year just past are to be noted the passing of several good bills which it is expected will soon become operative in the interest of “the man who errs.” New York being the foremost in prison reform legislation for the season of 1915-16. We are glad to learn that the way has now been made clear for the practical abolition of insanitary and antiquated Sing Sing prison, and the cell block system of prison construction, and the building of a new $2,000,000 prison along modern lines; remodeling Sing’ Sing for use merely as a receiving and distributing centre. The New York Legislature also adopted a plan under which long-term prisoners by faithful performance of their work and good behavior may earn a commutation amounting to one-third of their minimum sentence, which is perhaps the most encouraging step of all recent enactments. Virginia took its first step toward abolishing convict labor, by repealing an act which permitted contracts to be made for the employment of prisoners. New Jersey has also become one of the progressive states in prison betterment and has revised a number of antiquated penal laws and enacted a new measure which calls for the destruction of records of conviction of juvenile offenders after a certain time. This may be extended in time, so as to include all first offenders who shall have proven to have lived a good, moral, upright life for a period of ten years after release, says a prominent legislator.</p>
