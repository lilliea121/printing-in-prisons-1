BILL TO COMPEL NATIONAL GUARD SERVICE IN N. Y. STATE       Compulsory service in the National Guard is provided in a bill recently introduced in the New York state legislature by Senator John. D. Stives, of the Senate committee on Military Affairs. The measure was prepared by Adjutant General Louis W. Stotesbury, and is said to have the endorsement of Governor Whitman.       The bill makes mandatory upon the Governor the preparation after August 1, 1916, of a list of all persons between the age of 18 and 45 years eligible for military service.
