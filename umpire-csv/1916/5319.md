Friday’s Games      In one of the weirdest games played this season the Ninth again defeated the Shed 8 to 1.   The Ninth scored six tallies in the first frame off Moony, who was yanked out in favor of Spitz, 7 passes and 2 strike outs were recorded of the pain.   Winters on the slab, for the Ninth fanned 3 and issued 5 passes.   Mack’s four-bagger in the first stanza, was the only feature of the game.   Score by innings as follows:   (Continued on fourth page)      (Continued from 1st page)      R. H. E. Ninth 6 0 0 0 2 0 0 0—8 5 0 Shed 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0—1 3 0   Doubles—Banks   Home run—Mack.
