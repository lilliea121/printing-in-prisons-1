GOVERNOR BRUMBAUGH QUIETLY MARRIED    Governor Martin G. Brumbaugh and Miss Flora Belle Parks, his ward and fifth degree cousin, who for more than 20 years has been a member of his household, were married quietly Saturday afternoon. The ceremony was performed in the church of the Brethren, Germantown, at 4 oâ€™clock.       When news of the marriage became public, friends of the Governor expressed surprise. Then it was learned that the marriage license had been obtained two days before, but had been withheld from publication at the wish of the Executive.       In answer to his express wish, the simple Dunkard marriage ceremony was considerably shortened and the marriage party were in the quaint, historic church not more than 10 minutes. About 40 close friends of the Governor and his bride, including members of his official family and of his staff, witnessed the ceremony. Simplicity ruled the occasion.       Immediately after the ceremony the Governor and his bride left for Washington, D.C, where they will stop for a few days, prior to a trip to the Hot Springs, Va.
