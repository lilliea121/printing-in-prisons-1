NOTED WRITERS DO NOT COMPETEIn attempting to explain how it is that great works of literature endure through the ages, Victor Higo says that, “the chef-d’oeuvre of today will be the chef-d’oeuvre of tomorrow. Does Shakespeare interfere in any way with Sophocles? Does Moliere take anything from Plautus? Even when he borrowed Amphitryon ho does not take him from him. Does Figaro blot out Sancho Panza? Does Cordelia suppress Antigone? No. Poets do not climb over each other. The one is not the stepping-stone of the other. They rise up alone, without any other lever than themselves. They do not tread their equal under foot. Those who rank first in the field respect those who came before them. They succeed, they do not replace each other. The beautiful does not drive away the beautiful.
