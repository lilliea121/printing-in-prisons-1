<h1>Nullifying Gravity</h1>

<p>NULLIFYING GRAVITY The recent achievement of a physicist, who succeeded in nullifying, apparently the law of gravity, is by no means the only incident of the kind recorded recently in the annals of science. M. Bachelet, a French physicist during a long residence in this county, experimented along similar lines and, some three or four years ago, made public exhibition of some of the results of his investigations. He showed, at that time, a small globe, three inches in diameter, suspended in the air, without support, and, to all appearances, subject to his control. Both suspension and control, he explained, were effected through high potential discharges for which he hid received his inspiration from observing the particles of Just in suspension in the perfectly still atmosphere following in the wake of desert dust storms. The opposite of this, he noted is observed when a very fine water spray is electrified. The droplets then coalesce, forming large drops, and fall to the ground with considerable force.</p>
