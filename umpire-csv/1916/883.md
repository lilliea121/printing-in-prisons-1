PANAMA CANAL MAY BE CLOSED FOR MONTHS       Governor Goethals of the Panama canal zone told the House Appropriations Committee Monday, that the slides in the big waterway were not caused, as has been said by turning the water in before the canal was complete. He would not indicate when the canal would be reopened to traffic.       General Goethals said the excavations were completed “in the dry” where the slides occurred near Gold Hill’ and the water, therefore, could not have been prematurely turned in there.       The 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 cubic yards involved in the present earth movements is being removed, he said, at the rate of 1,009,000 cubic yards a month, indicating that it certainly would not take more than eight months more to complete the work, and perhaps not half that long. He was confident that when this material was all removed there would be no further danger of slides.
