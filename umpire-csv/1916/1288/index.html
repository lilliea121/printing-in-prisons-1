<p>HABITThe debasing influence of a bad habit is evident to all who think, and a writer in The Castle has given his view of the subject in the following paragraph, which is aptly expressed:The hand of a workman can become so calloused as to be insensible to heat or cold, or any pain except of extreme degree. So it is with the mind and soul. If a man lives in an environment of profane and unchaste speech he becomes so hardened spiritually and mentally that he is not shocked by it; he is insensible of its presence. In many other things, too, one becomes so habituated to environment and conditions that one loses all consciousness of opportunities and responsibilities. It might be well for each one of us to sit down and take inventory. What evils we are letting slip into our lives? What great chance for good or advancement are we permitting to lie dormant?</p>
