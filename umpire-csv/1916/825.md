Let us banish all vain regrets, lift up your heads, and gird yourselves for brave and cheerful toil. “In time the release will come; rest, made sweet by toil; glory, that is bright after the darkness is passed; and victory so complete, that we shall not wish the conflicts to have been less stern, or the perils of life's highway less numerous or compelling.”
