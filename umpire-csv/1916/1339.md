ELABORATE PREPARATION FOR “AD” CLUBS PAGEANT       Philadelphia is to have a pageant, which the committee of the Poor Richard Club assert will be the most spectacular ever seen in the United States, as a part of the program for the entertainment of the Associated Advertising Clubs of the World, which will meet here in convention during the latter part of this month. Preparations are now fully under way and it is believed that many thousands of visitors from all over the country will visit this city in company with the delegates to the convention, as Philadelphians are noted for their hospitality to visiting guests.       In addition to the grand pageant, there is also to be one of the most extensive displays of fireworks ever attempted in this section of the country. The City Counsils have made an appropriation of $25,000 for the entertainment of the clubs, and one of the distinctive features will be a “Battle in the Air,” at the marine carnival at night, in which all possible realistic effect will be displayed.       It is estimated that about 10,000 men, over 200 floats and a score or more of bands will be here on the night of the street parade. One division will be devoted to showing Philadelphia’s fitness as a residential and manufacturing center, and it is claimed that in working out the plans for the pageant, the advertising men have been occupied in perfecting details since last November.
