INVERTED VALUES    Professor Fisher of Yale, says a baby is worth $90; a grown person $4,000.       I always knew that money talks,    But now I know it hollers;    Oh husaby, oh lullaby,    My little ninety dollars!       They say that riches all take wings,    My trepidation follers;    Oh husaby, oh lullaby,    My little ninety dollars!       The moon looks down the livelong night    And shines upon the cholera,    Amused to see four thousand plunks    Walk ninety little dollars.       New York Sun.
