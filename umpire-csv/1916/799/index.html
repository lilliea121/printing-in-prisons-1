<p>PERSEVERANCE Of all the virtues, what one stands us in better stead than perseverance? What is a greater aid in living? It is the combination patience and belief. It is not mere fortitude for it means positive happiness Many of the worst evils of life come from faintheartedness, or from lack of purpose. Few who keep persistently at a thing, with faith in its value, are unhappy. What the Scientists have made popular is a truth that most profound moral thinkers have emphasized. Samuel Johnston, with pardonable exaggeration, said that great works were performed not by strength but by perseverance; and while the current: saying about ‘genius being an infinite capacity for taking pains is less than half a truth, Disraeli was at least safe when he declared patience a necessary ingredient of genius.
