THE SALE OF DEAD LETTERS      Twice a year, in Washington, they hold a curious auction. It is called the Dead Letter Sale, but in reality it is the sale of packages that have been sent to the Dead Letter Office because of deficient postage or wrong directions.      After these packages have been held for a certain length of time, in order to give senders or owners an opportunity to claim them, they are sold at public auction.      It is often a strange and pathetic collection. Most of the articles are cheap enough, although valuable things are not lacking; but who can estimate the intrinsic value of some of those lost gifts—the time, and sacrifice, and love they represent? How many disappointed hearts must have watched in vain for them! How many lives were robbed of a happiness that rightfully belonged to them, because of the sender’s carelessness or ignorance!
