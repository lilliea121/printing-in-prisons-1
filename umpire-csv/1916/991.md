COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN MENTIONED FOR JUDGESHIP       Recent information from reliable sources indicates that John Monaghan, of the Public Service Commission, soon will be appointed by Governor Brumbaugh to fill the vacancy in the Philadelphia Common Pleas Court, which was caused by the death of Judge Ralston.       Both the McNichol and Vare elements in the organization are favorable to Mr. Monaghan, who is noted for his diplomatic and legal abilities, and would seem to be the most logical choice for the position.
