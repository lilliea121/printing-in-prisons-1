PACKARD COMPANY TO PROMOTE ONLY AMERICANS       A recent report from Detroit, Mich., states that the Packard Motor Car Co., will demand that among its employes, from now on, American ideas, American patriotism and loyalty to America shall be first in the minds and hearts of all Packard employes and on their stanch Americanism will stand all hope of promotion.       The announcement has been made to 12,300 employes.       “After this date, promotion to positions of importance in the organization of this company will be given only to those who are native-born or naturalized citizens of the United States, or to those of foreign birth who have relinquished their foreign citizenship and who have filed with our Government their first papers applying for citizenship which must be diligently followed to completion.       “A prerequisite to employment in this company is loyalty to our Government and our flag.”
