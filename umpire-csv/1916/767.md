UNEMPLOYED PLOBLEM SOLVED    The city of Lynn, Massachusetts, has a public forest of about 2,000 acres. It was recently decided to help the unemployed by clearing up this forest. An appropriation of $ 20,000 was made and 200 men set to work. In order to keep them at work when the appropriation became exhausted, a campaign called the “Bya-cord-of-wood” movement was started, and proved quite successful. This practical aid for the unemployed might well be adopted, with variations, by other wide awake communities.
