<h1>The Loss of a Noted Writer</h1>

<p>THE LOSS OF A NOTED WRITER The literary world—and for that matter the world at large—has lost a gifted and talented writer in the passing away of Jeannette L. Gilder, at her home in New York City, the other day. Miss Gilder was a woman of unusual abilities, and possessed a charm of manner that was most pleasing to those who came within the circle of her acquaintance. At an early age Miss Gilder became a writer in the Newark Register, and later the Newark, N. J. reporter for the N.Y. Tribune. Her next step was to become associated with her late brother, R. W. Gilder, as an editorial writer for Scribner’s Magazine, now the Century. From there she changed to become the literary, dramatic and musical department editor of the N. Y. Herald. At later intervals she started the Critic and the Putnam's Magazines, with her brother Joseph. She was also the author of many interesting books of fiction and poetry, and wrote several well-known plays; among them, “Quits,” “Seven Oaks,” and “A Wonderful Woman,” the latter for Rose Eytinge. The loss of this brilliant woman will leave vacant a place that will be hard to fill.</p>
