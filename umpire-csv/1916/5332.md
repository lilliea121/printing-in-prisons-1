Wednesday’s Games    Cubs 10—Shed 3      In a farcical contest the Cubs assaulted the apathetic Sheds 10 runs to 3.   The Shed team was a bit wabbly in the field and were credited with several misplays.    Bobby pitched a strong game for the Cubs, fanning 7, walking 1 and 2 hit by pitched ball.    Blackie was wild and had poor support; he fanned 2 and issued 7 passes.    Bank’s home run and the fielding of Taylor and Albie featured the game.   Score by innings as follows:   R. H. E. Cubs 2 4 1 2 1 0 0 0—10 6 0 Shed 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0—3 3 3    (Continued on fourth page)      (Continued from 1st page)   Umpires—Slim and Andy.
