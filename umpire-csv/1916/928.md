SNOW A CURIOSITY      During the past (southern) Winter the people of Kimberly, South Africa, enjoyed the unusual experience of a snowstorm. A correspondent of “Symons’ Metropological Magazine” writes, that “people all turned out to snowball, and the natives, many of whom had never seen such a sight before, were most excited. My native chairwoman told me when she woke in the morning that she thought someone had been breaking into the shops and had scattered flour all over the place!”
