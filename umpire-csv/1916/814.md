CITY HALL COURT TO BE CLEARED OF “RUNNERS”    Sharpers, “Cop Detectives” And Other Undesirables To Be Kept Out    A change for the better was recently made at the City Hall, when the corridor leading to the police court on the sixth floor was cleared by reserve policemen of the veritable mob of “runners”? for lawyers and professional bail goers and “cop detectives.”       The policemen, acting under the orders of Captain Mills, of the new traffic division, threatened the “runners” with arrest if they returned to the building. Most of the “runners” hurried away, but the more hardened ones, who boasted of the “political, pulls” of the lawyers employing them, threatened to separate the policeman from their jobs. Captain Mills gave them cold comfort.       “I am going to stop these ‘runners’ from hanging around the building,” he said, “and have given orders to the City Hall guards to keep them out. I have no intention of interfering with respectable lawyers, but their ‘helpers’ will not be permitted to prey on unfortunates.”       Captain Mills explained that the “cop detective” constituted a new class of sharpers, who “spotted” detectives, particularly vice squad men, in police court, and “tipped them off” when they appeared in the Tenderloin.       Acting detective Palmer was cut on the head and face by a negro woman about a week ago, as the result of a “tip” given by one of these “cop detectives.”
