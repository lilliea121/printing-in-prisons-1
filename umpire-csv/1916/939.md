CONGRESSMAN VARE VISITS SECRETARY DANIELS Seeks to Impress Advantages of Philadelphia for Location of Armor Plant A Washington report states that Representative William S. Vare came from Philadelphia Monday to appear before Secretary Daniels and urge that the Government armor plant, if | authorized by Congress, should be located in Philadelphia. In his conversation with Mr. Vare, Secretary Daniels is reported to have said that the Government would required twice as much armor as heretofore, and the building of a Government armor plant would not interfere with private concerns. Mr. Vare before returning to Philadelphia said that he had impressed upon Mr. Daniels the advantages of Philadelphia for the armor plant, the research laboratory, and a central iron foundry. “I tried to show Secretary Daniels the need for the proposed 1700-foot drydock at Philadelphia,” added Mr. Vare. “I explained to him that if he still advocated a drydock at Norfolk, he should recommend two drydocks, so that the logical selection of the Philadelphia Navy Yard may still be made. Mr. Daniels said that he would carefully consider the suggestion that there be two drydocks, if it should still be deemed expedient to place one at Norfolk, but he will give his decision before the House Naval Affairs Committee the latter part of March.”
