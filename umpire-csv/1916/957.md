Compensation Law Proves Popular Only 300 Out of 210,000 Reject Liability Act       The Philadelphia Claim Menâ€™s Association met Saturday at the Bellevue-Stratford, and after a dinner, discussed statistics and compensation laws.      Paul N. Furman, chief of the Bureau of Statistics, presided. He said that of the 210000 employers in the State, only 300 had rejected the terms of the compensation law, and that both employers and workers were satisfied with the act.
