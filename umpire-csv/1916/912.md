$2,500,000 PENSION BILL PASSES SPANISH WAR VETERANS BENEFITED       Two pension bills passed the House recently proposing the addition of more than $2,500,000 annually to pension expenditures.       One would grant to widows and minor children of officers and enlisted men who served 90 days either as regulars or volunteers in the war with Spain or in the Phillippine insurrection between April 21, 1898, and July 4, 1902. The prospect is that there would be 10,000 claims under this measure, requiring $1,500,000 the first year.       The other bill would give $20 a month to survivors of Indian wars from 1865 to January 1891, who served 90 days or more in a actual campaign and who are 62 years old or more, and would pay $12 a month to widows of such soldiers.
