<h1>Qualities Of Friendship</h1>

<p>QUALITIES OF FRIENDSHIP At times we may enjoy the brilliant, superficial conversationalist. Their talk sparkles like the fireflies on a summer night. They have been everywhere—claim to know about all the people worth knowing—have seen all the sights worth seeing, and have done nearly everything worth doing. Perhaps we may feel somewhat behind the times, a little stupid and abashed while we are in their presence. When the scene is changed we are glad to be back with those who cause us to feel at ease by their gracious tact, thoughtfulness and endearing kindness. They lead us to feel that we and they are on nearly even terms; they do not seek to seem grandly superior that we may feel our lack of superior qualities. To begin the presence of such a genuinely wholesome person is an actual delight. They look straight at us when they speak, and their eyes denote sincerity, for they depend upon truth and simplicity, and are not dissemblers. For they say just what they mean and would rather seem kind than exceedingly clever. Truly these are the qualities that wear well, and the very essence of all real friendship.</p>
