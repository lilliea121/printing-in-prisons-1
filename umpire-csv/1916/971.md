COME UP HIGHER    By James G. Clark       I saw the mountains stand    Silent, wonderful, a d grand,    Looking out across the land    When the golden light was falling    On distant dome and spire;    And heard a low voice calling    “Come up higher, come up higher    From the lowland and the mire,    From the mist of earth desire,    From the vain pursuit of pelf,    From the attitude of self: Come up higher, come up higher.”
