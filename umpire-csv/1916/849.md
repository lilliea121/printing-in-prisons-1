FAIRYLAND    To Algernon Blackwood    Whither lies the white road, the right road to Fairyland?    We find no sign nor trace of it, and old we’ve grown and gray.    Our eyes are dim with peering, and our questing feet are weary,    And there’s ne’er a soul to guide us Wee Folk all away.    Who can tell the dear way, the near way to Fairyland,    Where none, they say, wax old or sad? It’s there that we would be.    How shall we believe that the sun and stars will show it us.    Child and bird and field-flower and butterfly and tree?    Who keeps the gold key, the old key of Fairyland?    Always and all ways we seek it near and father    Whisht! foolish wanderers—turn, and ye shall find it    In each heart where wonder and love and worship are.
