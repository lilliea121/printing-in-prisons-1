<h1>Another Dante Anniversary</h1>

<img width="200" src="/assets/img/" />
<p>ANOTHER DANTE ANNIVERSARY There is now under way the perfecting of plans for celebration in May, of the six hundred and fifty first anniversary of the birth of Dante. It may be said that the worldâ€™s interest in Dante is far more than interest in a poet. He was a poet, but he was more. He was a prophet, a pioneer of truth and freedom. Withal, he was an arch-lover, a tender, chaste, ardent, inspired disciple of love. His writing on Christianity seems to fairly sparkle in the lines of Divine Comedy. The atonement salvation by Christ alone, he saw and announced. Modern Christians lament the fury of his descriptions of the sufferings of lost souls, but rejoice that in the darkness and corruption of the Middle Ages this brave and gifted man found and proclaimed so much of Gospel truth. Who can think of Dante without remembering Beatrice? A vague, mysterious, bewitching character, she shines ever above the image of the poet himself. He possessed her not on earth, but found her in the heavenlies. And his pure love, his obedient following of the light she shed upon his life, area constant challenge to every true man to follow the purest and highest star that shines for his own soul.</p>
