BANNER YEAR FOR TRADE WITH SOUTH AMERICA       A New York trade paper states that all previous records for one calendar year of trade between the United States and South America were broken in 1915, according to figures made public by the foreign trade department of the National City Bank. Based on statistics    for eleven months for the entire country and upon December’s figures for the port of New York, the imports from South America last year reached an estimated total of $320,000,000 and the exports to South America $145,000,000.       This combined total of $465,000, 000 is greater by about $92,000,000 than the figures of 1912, the previous banner year. The imports are 40 per cent greater than in 1914, according to the bank’s figures and the exports 60 per cent greater.
