U.S. FLEET BEING MADE FIT FOR WAR       It is evident that the new Bureau of Operations, which was created over 14 months ago, has made great advances in bringing the navy’s activities to a more efficient basis, according to the statements of Rear Admiral William S. Benson, Chief of the Bureau, at the exercises of the graduating class of the Naval Academy.       Speaking the navy’s preparedness, Admiral Benson declared that it was the purpose of the Secretary of the Navy, to have 100 per cent. efficiency for men and ships and that the operations bureau had made possible a long step toward realization of such a policy, under which “every unit of the fleet will at all times be ready to perform is functions whatever the the occasion that may require its service.”       Every ship of the fleet is ready for instant duty, he added except the battleships Georgia and Connecticut, which are undergoing boiler repairs. Among the most important work undertaken, Admiral Benson said, is the registration of all American merchant ships for naval uses in war.
