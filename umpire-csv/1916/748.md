MISS DAVIS REQUESTED TO RESIGN AS COMMISSIONER    But Mayor Mitchell Offers Her Position On The Parole Board    Dr. Katherine B. Davis, Commissioner of Correction, the first woman to hold an important administrative position in N. Y. city, resigned to accept an appointment by Mayor Mitchell to the new Municipal Parole Board. Her salary will be about the same as she received as commissioner. A commission appointed to investigate conditions at Blackwell’s Island and other places of detention under the administration of Miss Davis, found a most deplorable state of affairs at the island, and unanimously recommended her immediate removal. Rumors were to the effect that the “Black Hole of Calcutta” was no worse than Blackwell’s Island under Miss Davis’ rule. Mayor Mitchell appointed Miss Davis as Commissioner of Correction when he took office January 1, 1914. A few days before she had resigned as superintendent of the Bedford Reformatory for Women, which position she had held since 1901.
