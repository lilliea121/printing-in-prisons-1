<p>DID YOU—? “Did you give him a lift? He’s a brother of man, And bearing about all the burden’ he can. Did you give him a smile? He was downcast and blue, And the smile would have helped him to battle it through, “Did you give him your hand? He was slipping down hill, And the world, so I fancied, was using him ill, Did you give him a word? Did you show him the road, Or did you just let him go on with his load? Did you show “Do you know what it means to be losing the fight. When a lift just in time might set everything right? Do you know what it means—just a clasp of a hand, When a mans bone about all a man ought to stand? “Did you ask why it was—why the quivering? Why the half-suppressed sob, and the scalding tears drip? Were you brother of his when the time came of need? Did you offer to help him, or didn’t you heed?” (—Selected)</p>
