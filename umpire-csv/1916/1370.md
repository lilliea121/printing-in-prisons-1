BALL GAMES OF THE WEEK   Tuesday’s Games    Ninth 9—Printers 0       The Printers showed a reversal of baseball form in today’s game, the Ninth shutting them out 9—0.       The Printers lacked the essential bang, and the passes were liberal, while wild pitches helped.       The Ninth bunched their hits off Slim, and forced his retirement in the seventh frame, and then continued their attack against 6982 and Hagy.       Eleven strike outs and 7 passes were recorded against the Printers trio.       Mack the Ninth pitcher, held the Printers to 3 hits, while he fanned 9, and passed 4.       A fast triple play by the Printers featured the game.       Score by innings as follows:    R. H.E. Ninth 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 5—9 7 0 Printers 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0—0 3 0   Triple—Chick.    Two base hits—Jacoby; Charley.    Umpires—Marty and Collins.
