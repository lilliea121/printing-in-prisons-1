A CHANGE IN MANAGERS       At a special meeting of the E. S, P. Baseball Commission, the resignation of B 7774 manager of the Shed was tendered and accepted and upon his recommendation, B 7560, Smithy was unanimously elected to fill the vacancy. The Commission also unanimously agreed upon the following:       Regardless of the number of innings or part thereof played during any game, the team having the most runs when the whistle is blown is the winning team. If rain or any other unforseen occurence shall in any way interfere with the progress of a game and the game is called by the umpire during the period between 4.30 and 5 p.m. the team having the most runs, regardless of innings or part thereof shall be the winning team. —B 7981 Pres.—B 6286 Sec.
