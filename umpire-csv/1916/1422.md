CONGRESS AWAITS WORD OF PRESIDENT TO DECLARE WAR    Troops are Being Hurried to the Border —100,000 Men Ready by the End of This Week       Congress and the war department have put renewed energy into their preparations for war. Should a formal break occur at any time, General Funston will be in a position to defend the border states against Mexican raids.       Orders have been issued to departmental commanders calling for greater speed in getting the national guard to the scene of action. The need of troops at the border is imperative and no time should be lost in transporting the men to their proper destination.       It is estimated that their will be nearly 100,000 troops under General Funston’s command by the end of this week. Should Congress declare war with Mexico, Funston will be in a position to begin operations on a war footing.       Late despatches indicate that General Pershing now has 12 000 men under his command and is in a position to defend his troops against Mexican assault or treachery.
