AN EXCELLENT EXAMPLE It is a pleasure to note that Switzerland, which has furnished suggestions for many excellent political and governmental reforms, has a good method of handling the liquor problem. The government has a monopoly of the alcohol business and all profits are turned over to the cantons, or states, which must use a certain portion of them in combating alcoholism and stamping it out. In that way the liquor evil is made to regulate and exterminate itself. Our system, whereby the tax on liquors goes into the general fund and thus tempts congress to extravagance, is a vicious one. It makes the government a partner in the evil, and keeps it interested in the perpetuation of the traffic, whereas it ought on the contrary to be aiming for the abolition of it, if it is devoted to the welfare of the people which it very properly should.
