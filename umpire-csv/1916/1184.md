A UNIQUE LIGHTSHIP       Off the Island of Islay, on the west coast of Scotland, there is stationed, at the Otter Rock a unique lightship. It is unmanned; yet it can be relied on to display the warning light to guide the mariner on this dangerous coast. It is a most ingeniously constructed vessel and the only one of its kind. In its two steel tanks a sufficient quantity of gas can be stored to supply the lantern for several months.       Experiments have shown that the light may be depended upon. to burn continuously for months at a time. The approximate duration of the light can be predetermined, and there is no danger whatever of its being extinguished by wind or spray.       The light is visible at a distance of from eight to twelve miles. The lightship also has a bell, which is made to ring automatically by means of an ingenious device that utilizes the gas as it passes from the tanks to the lantern to work the bell clapper.
