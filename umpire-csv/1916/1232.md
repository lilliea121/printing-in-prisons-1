LIVE WIRE THOUGHTS       Thoughts are things—little things at first— but they soon become great engines for good or evil. Doing right is predicated on thinking right.       Do not promise anything until you know that you can make good. Nothing cuts the soul so deep and keen as the demolition of expectation— the giving of one, gratuitously, a hope which he can never realize. The pain thus caused, from the despair born from the dead hope, is a tortuous death in a starless night.       It may be important for the average prisoner to try to get out of prison. It is vastly more important, however, that he keep out of prison. Every man who comes back to prison disgraces himself, lessens the world’s sympathy for the unfortunates, as well as bringing shame and sorrow upon the head of his benefactors.    —The Prison Observer.
