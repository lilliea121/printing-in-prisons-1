Cooks 16—Bakers 3       The Cooks won Saturday’s game, by good   (Continued on fourth page)      (Continued from 1st page)   clouting and the inability of the Bakers to hit Big Doc safely.    Big Doc, for the Cooks was master at all stages of the game, fanning 8 while he issued but one pass.   Bobby was found for 18, hits, while he fanned 9 and passed 5.   Banks and Big Bill captured the fielding honors while, Dick, Morgan and Jordan led at bat.    In the absence of Mack, Slats officiated as umpire.
