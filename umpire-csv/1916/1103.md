Delaware River Bridge Commission to Begin Work Soon       At a meeting of the members of the Delaware River Bridge and Tunnel Commission last week it was decided that the preliminary surveys and plans for the proposed bridge across the Delaware ought to be made in the next six months.       Colonel Gorge Pfeiffer said the commission ought to learn what Philadelphia was doing for the bridge project, and thought the Pennsylvania city should share the expense of the preliminary survey. The colonel was told that when the standing committees were appointed steps would be taken to secure unity of action.
