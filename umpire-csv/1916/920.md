THE SLIPS OF JUDGES      There appeared in a western paper recently an account of a criminal trial that, took place in the State of Missouri, defendant was charged with obtaining money under false pretenses. The indictment, stated that, the. defendant, ‘feloniously, designedly, knowingly, and fraudulently” procured money from. “one John D. — by means of a false deed of trust. In this case, the judge, according to the newspaper account, instructed the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal because the Person who drew up the indictment left out the word aide before the words “feloniously, designedly,” etc, It was a clear case of the guilt of the defendant;. but owing to a slip of some hurried. typist, the prisoner at the bar was ‘declared “not guilty.” Without question, this was most fortunate for the defendant, but on the other hand it is not somewhat disturbing to persons. who would like to believe in judicial processes and maintain due respect for the court? The decision reminds us of another case which was tried in an eastern State, where the jurymen were allowed to read the newspapers giving an account of the case on trial, which was very detrimental to the defendants. While the judge instructed the; jury to decide on the evidence alone—and real evidence was not shown—the jury promptly. declared the defendants “guilty.”       In the first case, the court could. have ordered the. correction made, then and there in court, without any prejudice to the defendant, if the correction was necessary. However, the judge’ said there were precedents for this action. To be sure there are—perhaps hundreds of them; but that is no argument against good judgment and common sense. We happen to know of several Supreme Court judges in a distant State who didn’t know that there had been for years on their statute books a law declaring that no indictment’ should be considered insufficient by reason of any defect or imperfection of form which did not tend to the prejudice of a substantial right of the defendant, and that any indictment was good which enabled a person of common understanding to know what was intended. Yet judges, and Lawyers wonder why the layman seem lacking in respect for the courts. Every now and then a foolish technicality enables an artful judge to use the livery of justice for other than purely judicial ends. Not long ago one of these turned loose a very dangerous character because the indictment used one word when it should have used another. In reality both words had about the same meaning to the uninitiated, but there was a slight difference in their legal meaning. It so happened that not one of the jurors knew — the technical meaning of either word. It seems odd to say that. they could and would have rendered exact justice without knowing what they were about. It was a shrewd observer who not long since said, in response to an opening prayer about “saving the honorable court,” that “what the court really needed was to be saved from itself.”
