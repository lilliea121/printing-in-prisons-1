Ninth 6—Cubs 5       The Ninth won from the Cubs by the close score of 6—5, and it was a hard fought game from the start.       Manager Boyd was dissatisfied with a decision made by the Umpire in the 4th inning, and the game was finished under a protest.       Charley for the Ninth pitched a strong game for the 5 innings he was on the mound, allowing only 1 hit, struck out 5 and walked 2, then gave way to Mac, who finished up in good form, allowing only 1 hit.       Boyd for the Cubs was touched for 9 hits, struck out 8 and walked 2.       Score by innings as follows:       R. H. E. Cubs 0 1 1 3 0 0 0 0—5 2 0 Ninth 2 0 0 2 1 1 0 0—6 9 2       Doubles— Mac; Chick 3; Fats.       Umpires—Slim and Frank.
