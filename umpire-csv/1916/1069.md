A NOVEL PAROLE METHOD       In the current Issue of Popular Mechanics reference is made to a new and novel method of parole, wherein an inmate while serving sentence for his offense is permitted to work out side the institution to which he is committed, returning in the evening to sleep. In fact the the prison, or House of Correction, at Dayton, Ohio, is his home; his conduct is supervised by the head of the institution and with the exception of this supervision he is a free man, his conduct insuring his privilege. This idea appears to solve many problems, and no one will say but that their are many problems facing a paroled man.       Two of the main issues are provided for; living and work,—there knowing that with exemplary conduct these issues are met, his endeavor will be to live up to the confidence placed in him, for to break it means the withdrawing of the enjoyed privileges. He will acquire the habit of right living, which will be as hard to throw off as the habits that caused his downfall. During his term he is paid regular wages, a portion being paid to his dependents while the remainder is devoted to his personal use. There is much to be said of this method from the inmates point of view, where the intent to meet the “after prison—what?” problem is hazy and hopeless.—B 7542
