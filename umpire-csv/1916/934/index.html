<p>IT COULDN’T BE DONE Somebody said it couldn’t be done, But he with a smile replied, That “maybe it couldn’t,” but he would be one Who couldn’t say so till he tried. So he started right in with a trace of a grin On his face, and if worried he hid it. He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldn’t be done, and he did it. Somebody scoffed: “Oh, you'll never do that; At least no one ever has done it.” But he took off his hat and slipped off his coat, And the first thing we knew he’d begun it; With a lift of his chin, and a bit of a grin Without any doubting to quit it, He started to sing as he tackled the thing That couldn’t be done and he did it. There are thousands to tell you it cannot be done, There are thousands to prophesy failure; There are thousands to point out to you, by one, The dangers that wait to assail you; But just buckle in with a bit of a grin, Then take off your coat and go to it; -Just start in to sing as you tackle the thing That “cannot be done” and you’ll do it. —Author unknown.
