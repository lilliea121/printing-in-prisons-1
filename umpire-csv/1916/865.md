$300,000 RAISE IN WAGES BY THE CRAMPS       Increases in wages amounting to more than $300,000 a year and applying to between 4000 and 5000 workers were voluntarily granted to the employees of the William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company and the J. P. Morris Company. The new wage scale will become effective on February 28. Monday afternoon a notice was posted in the yards announcing the advance, equal to ten per cent. in the hourly wage rates.
