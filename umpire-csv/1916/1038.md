To Inmates Desiring To Write For Publication       On page two, column one, will be found instructions for inmates desiring to write for publication in this paper. The articles submitted should be legible and of interest to the readers of the Umpire. The writer should understand that the article submitted must not criticize government or state officials, or the officials of penal institutions, nor cast reflections of a controversial nature on other inmates. If these facts are borne in mind, it may help to avoid the errors into which a number of correspondents seem to have fallen.       The design of the Umpire is to uplift and assist others as far as possible, and not to indulge in personalities or needless recriminations which may lead to strife or ill feeling among the inmates.â€”Editor
