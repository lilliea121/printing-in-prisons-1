REVISED JUDGEMENT    By Roy Temple House       When I was somewhat younger I opined    (‘Twas what they always taught me as a lad)    The two great classes of our mankind    Were these: good men and bad    I’ve touched men in a thousand ways since    then,       Sometimes as creditor, sometimes as debtor;    And I have found the two great types of men    To be: good men and better.
