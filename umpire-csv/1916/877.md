THE UMPIRE CENTENARIANS OF THE NATIONS Serbia according to statistics printed in England, is particularly the country of centenarians. In that land one man in every 2,260 has-lived to be 100 years old, the total male centenarian population of Serbia being 575. Ireland ranks next in the longevity list. In the Emerald Isle, out of every 8,130 of population there is one centenarian, the total number of centenarians being 578. Out of every 43,000 Spaniards one is a centenarian. Norway has twenty-three centenarians, or one in about 96,000. England, Scotland and Wales have about one centenarian to every 177,000 of population. France has 213 centenarians, or one in 180, 750. Sweden ranks seventh with twenty only, or one in 250,000. Germany has one in 702, 000. Denmark only claims two, or less than one to 1,000,000 of its population; and Switzerland, with all its reputed healthiness, seems not to possess a single centenarian.
