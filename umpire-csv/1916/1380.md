Pennsylvania is noted for its lead in all lines of industry, and for its advance in modern business methods. The latest example is that of a Pittsburgh concern which realizes that generosity is the most profitable advertising medium. A leading drug company of the city now makes it a practice to fill prescriptions free of charge for all persons who are in need of medicines but unable to pay for them and who are sent to them by any worthy charitable institution or physician. Excellent! Other places might do equally as well by adopting this worthy idea.
