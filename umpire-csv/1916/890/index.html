<p>IMPROVED LIGHTING SYSTEM SAID TO BEAT DAYLIGHT The Illuminating Engineers Society, of which Dr. Charles P. Steinmetz is president, has just opened their 10th annual convention at the Engineering Building in New York city. L. B Marks, the first president of the society said the country’s lighting bill had increased by leaps and bounds, “and is now estimated at $1,000,000,000 a year,”? A interesting announcement by. Mr. Marks was that the engineers had been. able to improve on daylight. “Following the improvement of lamps,” he said, “progress has been made in the production of artificial daylight on a peculiar though limited scale. We are no longer dependent upon the sun for daylight quality of illumination; in some classes of work where fine color discrimination is vital, as in dye works, for example, we have actually improved upon daylight conditions, because our artificial daylight is of the same quality as the natural light and is absolutely constant and available 24 hours a day. Art galleries may be equipped with lighting facilities to exhibit paintings in artificial daylight, an achievement which the artist has tong desired.”</p>
