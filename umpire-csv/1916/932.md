HIGHLY IMPROVED GASOLINE ENGINE INVENTED       A late report from Lancaster, Pa., states that H. B. Keiper, president of the Champion Blower and Forge Company, has received the patent for a new kind of gasoline engine, invented by himself, after three years of study and experiments. It has been tested over 2800 miles of road and consumes only half the amount of gasoline used by an ordinary engine and develops 25 per cent. more power.       In testing his new engine. Mr. Keiper used a 1913 Ford car for convenience in putting in his engine. With this car the ordinary run with a single gallon of gasoline has been 30 and 31 miles, through 32 7-10 miles have been made. By using a single valve, which performs the function of in take and exhaust, there is no commingling of pure gas with burnt gas, because the latter is discharged before the other enters the chamber. Because of the contracted size of this chamber, which just covers the cylinder, every particle of power of the gas acts directly on the cylinder, giving it increased power that is lost in the old style engines.       The invention can be used for any style of automobile and for any work where a gasoline engine is employed.
