IMMENSE NEW SHIPYARD IN COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION       It is learned from good authority that preliminary work has been started on the new shipyard of the Sun Shipbuilding Company, a $5,000,000 corporation which will establish one of the most modern yards in the country, in the upper end of Chester. The company owns 50 acres of land at this point and has a 1500 foot frontage on the Delaware.       The Philadelphia and Reading Railway started Saturday to lay sidings over the property. Work on the ways, bulkheads and wharf will be begun as soon as permission is obtained from the Board of Commissioners of Navigation, which will meet on May 18.
