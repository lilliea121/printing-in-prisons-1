EFFERVESCENCES    By Jingles    Do crash suits make a noise in the fall?    A whip should be all it is cracked up to be. Scales that prove inaccurate, are weighed, and found wanting.    The artist cannot draw upon his imagination, when his mind is a blank.    Wouldn't a man be a “bird” if he had on duck trousers, a swallowtail coat, and a batwing tie?   The critic who writes a roast might not relish it much, if he were made to eat his own words.    There is no opportunity for the man who is ready to face it.    The man who wishes to live in a small town or go to Heaven, must behave himself. Mackentieville is a small place.
