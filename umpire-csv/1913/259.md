A NEW PIPE Mr. James Loan of the store house is probably the only merchant in the country who is doing business on a losing basis and fully enjoying it. He is always on the alert for opportunities to give his customers the biggest values for the least money, and lately has added to his stock some genuine French briar wood pipes with the famous ‘‘Bakelite’’ mouthpiece. I is claimed that ‘‘Bakelite’ is stronger and more brilliant than amber, and that it is tasteless, odorless, and non-inflammable. Its full and unusual chemical name is Oxybenzlinethylenglycolanhydride. If the merits of the pipe are at all proportionate to its name, then the ‘‘Bakelite,’’ has them all beaten, by several million miles. These pipes cost $6 per dozen, wholesale, and in keeping with his liberal policy, Mr. Loan is handing them out for 50 cents each. He has also added to his stock of staples, a Pine Tar Soap, of the well-known Williams’ make at .05 cents and Prophylactic toothbrushes, at 18 cents. As the Warden has solved the most difficult part of the high cost of living in the matter of necessities for us, Mr. Loan is lending his efforts in cutting down the cost of luxuries. Itis hoped that his energies may never tire.
