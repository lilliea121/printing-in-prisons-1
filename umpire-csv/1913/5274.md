CUBS WIN FROM SHED    June 11   In the first four innings of the Cubs-— Stocking Shed game this afternoon, thirteen men faced Ducky, only one of whom reached first base, and that one walked. Seven others were struck out. In the fifth, the little fellow weakened and as the Cubs saw it, began to show their teeth and hit the ball. Those who couldn’t hit, were passed and four runs rushed over the plate, at least two of which could have been cut off had the catcher been on the job. The Shed tallied one run in each of the first two innings, and had a man on third base, in the third, when Rile, a new man struck out. After that Tommie held them down to one single hit during the rest of the game. Score 4-2. Umpire, Happy.    — Mitch.
