BAND WINS FROM SHED    There was rejoicing in the Band room on Thursday night and with good reason, for the Musicians had overcome their must formidable opponent in the tail-end struggle by the score 6—5. No red fire was burnt on the campus, nor was there noisome frivolity in the dorms. but, on Friday they took advantage of the holiday to get rid of some of their pent-up joy and blew themselves for fair at the concert. Herman, Walter and Larry formed the battery unmasked by the Band while the boys from the Stocking Shed, replied with Floyd and Spetts. The game was well contested throughout the full six innings, with a creditable vigor that left the result in doubt until the whistle blew. — Mitch.
