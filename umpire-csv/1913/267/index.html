<p>FOUND The following correspondence, evidently a copy of a letter and a reply thereto, was found on the Ninth Block. Owner may have same by applying in person to this office. My dearest Uncle :—If you could see how I blush for shame as T am writing this, you would pity me. Why, because I must ask you for the loan of twenty five dollars, and I do not know how to express myself, it is impossible for me to tell you, indeed I would prefer to die. I send you this by special delivery and await an immediate reply. Believe me my dearest Uncle, your most obedient and affectionate Nephew, Jack. P. 8.— Overcome with remorse at what I have written, I have been pounding on the door for the past fifteen minutes to get the Overseer, and have him return my letter. Heaven grant that he may lose the letter, or something else prevent same from reaching you. The second letter reads: My dear Jack:—Console yourself, and Providence has heard your prayer. The Overseer lost your letter. Your affectionate Uncle, —H. F. M.</p>
