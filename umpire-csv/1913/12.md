Rules for HealthAvoid drinking stuff from bottles before yon have looked at the labels.Refrain from working in coal mine where there are likely to be accumulations of fire-damp.When the elevator is crowded wait for the next car.Skate only where you know the ice to be thick.Wait for the car to stop, even if in so doing you waste three-quarters of a second of your valuable time.If the man who calls you a, liar is big and brawny, treat him with silent contempt.When you see a crowd of people running madly in one direction, turn and go the other way.Shun jails. They are likely to be very unsanitary.Don't be afraid of wearing out the bathtub. Thin people should always vacate the tub before removing the stopper, otherwise disaster will follow.
