SPECIAL MEETING    Several other professional players are on their way here, and due to arrive within the present week. Naturally there will be considerable competition to secure their services, and in order that no unfair advantage may be obtained by any manager, a rule has been made, prohibiting the signing of any player until after he has left the receiving gallery. A special meeting of the commission will be held at once to confirm this rule. The purpose of the President is to try and have these men signed up by the weaker clubs to make the contests more even and interesting.
