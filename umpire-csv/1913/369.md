THE New York District Attorney’s office has recently published some interesting statistics relative to criminals, from which it appears, that out of 2857 convicted men, only 789 were married. This would indicate a great preponderance of unmarried criminals, over those who are married, and naturally suggests an excellent medium for the reclamation of the degenerate, through the very simple method of marrying them off. This sounds good, but, now comes the statement of a Civil war veteran, who has just celebrated his one hundred and seventh birthday, to the effect that he attribute his good health and long life to the fact that he never married, and therefore was spared all the worry, anxiety and hard work, incidental to the care of a modern wife, and growing children. The question now, is it better to marry, in order to avoid the seduction of the doubtful pleasures of MacKentieville, and the certainty of a short life, or, remain in a state of single blessedness, to enjoy a long life, with the certainty that the greater portion of it will be spent in service to the State? Fortunately, there is a happy medium, else we should ask, what’s the answer?
