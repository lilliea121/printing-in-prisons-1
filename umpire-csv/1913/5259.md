Some Don’ts for Umpires      Don't argue over decisions with players; tell them to play ball.   Don't fail to keep your eye on the ball.   Don ' t ask a player if he was out, after you've called him out.   Don't pay any attention to remarks from spectators-it is for their benefit you are umpiring; if they become too strong, report them to the Overseer.   Don't try to justify yourself after the game, yon are only adding fuel - it is useless anyway.   Don't be afraid of asking the other umpire, if you are in doubt.   Don't be afraid of changing your decision when you know you're wrong. It is all rot about an umpire can not change his decision, when he sees he's wrong but do it quickly.   Don't let the players delay the game use your authority .   Don't be afraid of losing your friends if you are right-that's how some of us landed here.   Don't call a ball a strike just to even up when you've missed.   Don't mind if one team says your rot-   ten-the other team thinks you' re fine.   Don't, if umpiring bases, fail to follow up the plays.   Don't, for heaven sake, lose your head.
