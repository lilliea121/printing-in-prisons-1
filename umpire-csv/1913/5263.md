The Orchestra      FIRST comes Joe our leader,   With his :fiddle sweet and true,   And by him sits our old friend Jack: He plays :first fiddle, too.   Then come Steve and Billy,   My, how those clarinets scream ! With cadenzas, variations,   They'll put you in a dream. Dave, plays solo cornet,   Rage could too, (if he tried),   And Bell, you know, makes quite a show,   With his slippery trombone slide.   The baritone, is not a drone, Dear Goldie plays quite neat,   Bass runs, like guns, come rushing Exactly on the beat.   Larry, plays nifty on the Â·cello, Sweet solos, sombre, deep,   With the Wop and Jingles, Jonesy, Bob, Second :fiddles, violas, a heap.   The big bass fiddle, Jimmie plays, To keep us all in time,   In truth to tell, with Ralph and Dell, The Drums are bound to rhyme.   Henry, at the piano,   Strike "A," we'll get in tune,   Let the Poet sing a solo,   "Our Quartette," an old time tune.   - Tingles.
