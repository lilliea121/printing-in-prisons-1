WHEN Mr. Balfour was recently replying to criticisms of the parole law, he might have added, that contrary to the general impression, the terms under which the prisoners are paroled from this place are actually so severe, that there are men in the institution today, who have elected to remain the full maximum sentence, rather than conform to the rigid rules governing the granting of parole.    The general public can have no idea of the nature of the requirements exacted of a paroled man, otherwise there would not be any criticism.
