 “WORD OF HONOR” MEN    Forty-five Illinois convicts started to work on the State roads September 3, in charge of two unarmed overseers, and went about their task with a willingness that was a pleasure to see.    Before entering upon their labors, unknown to the officers, they took an oath among’ themselves, promising to deal summarily with any man who violated the trust imposed in him. They aver that any convict making his escape will be hunted down by his fellows, and severely punished by them, before handing him over to the authorities.    This is the proper spirit. No man should be permitted to jeopardize the comfort and privileges of hundreds of others for a momentary benefit to himself.
