ENGLISH LANGUAGE CLASSES    Classes in English Language for the benefit of the foreign-speaking inmates, will be reorganized here, on Friday next by students from the University of Pennsylvania. The classes will be along the same successful lines as those followed last year, and present a valuable opportunity to those of the foreign inmates who wish to learn the English language. Men desiring to attend these classes will send their number to the Chaplain at once, and those who attended last year, and were given books, are required to return them without delay.
