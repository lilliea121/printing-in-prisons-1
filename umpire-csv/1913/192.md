  The Umpire is in need of interesting material for its columns. Every man in
  the place has at least one good story concealed about his person. Let us have
  that story. Put it in good plain English, just as you would talk, and it will
  be readable and interesting. Don’t try to put it in verse. We are overwhelmed
  with poetry. It would seem that all of the poets in the state are in this
  place, and many people agree that it is the one good place for all good poets.
  Epigrams, of the right sort, are in large demand. Humor, original and within
  the proper ‘family lines’’ is also in demand. Essays on the results obtained,
  by the use of nitroglycerine in conjunction with iron or steel are not of
  special value, nor are subjects dealing with the newest methods of avoiding a
  ‘‘cop’’ of interest at present. Let your story be human. Be concise, but,
  don’t neglect descriptive details. If there are any rough edges in the grammar
  or composition, we will have the carpenter plane them down. Send them in.
