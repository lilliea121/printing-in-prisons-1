Games of July 30   Ninth vs Library—Cubs vs Band -- Plasterers vs Shed    SHED vs PLASTERERS The Shed and Plasterers met for the second contest of the week, with Ducky and John in the box for the Shed and Yaller for the Plasterers. Yaller pitched reckless ball the first inning and let the Ducklings score two runs, the only ones they secured in the game, after that he settled down, allowing but four hits and striking out nine men, while Duckie and John followed closely with seven to their credit. Joe of the Shed is a hard hitter driving two balls to the sixth block, but unfortunately they were caught by Andy. Rufus and Fingers each had a hit, Rufus died on third base, while Fingers reached second. Barber and Stump for the Plasterers each drove a ball over the twelfth block roof, Stump making a home run and bringing Barber home. Joe for the Shed made a sensational play in center field by catching a ball off Barber’s bat, and making a double play. Had Ducky not injured his arm in the second inning, there probably would be a different tale, as he was in good form and pitched splendid ball. The Ducklings played good ball, but were too weak for the terrible onslaught of the Plasterers. Umpires, Jack and Smithy. Score 8—2. —Millsy.
