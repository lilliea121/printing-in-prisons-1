ANOTHER DREAM.    AFTER boxing with three mutton stews, I rolled in bed to take a snooze. Thought came slow, and snores came thick, Soon as I hit the old “‘stir’’ tick. Troubles of earth soon slipped away, And dreams came to me that seemed like play. I saw a palatial train standing by, And heard the conductor’s ever welcome cry ; “All aboard, for Sunshine Port ! This train goes to the summer resort, Where care is shattered and hearts are free.”’ I saw him point direct at me, So I got aboard to taste of pleasure’s cup— When a bold, bad runner yelled, ‘‘Water up !” —Rocky
