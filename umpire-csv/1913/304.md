It is better to hope, thought the clouds hang low, And to keep the eyes still lifted, For the bright blue sky will still peep through, When the ominous clouds are rifted. There is never a night without a day, Or an evening without a morning; And the darkest hour, as proverbs say, Is the hour before the dawning. Far better to weave in the web of our life A bright and fearless filling, And keep up ‘‘Hope,” with a steady heart, And hands that are steady and willing, Than to snap the delicate minute threads Of our curious lives asunder, And then blame others for the tangled end, And sit and curse and wonder. —Pliny
