Cubs Vs Band    June 23    Of the three games played today that between the Cubs and Band was undoubtedly the most interesting and best fought out. It was nip and tuck until the conclusion of the last inning, when the score stood 6—6. Walt started the game in the box for the Band, with Dave catching. He was too easy for the Cubs, however and was forced to give way to big Louie, but, not until the Cubs had tallied four big runs, and apparently had the game cinched. Tommy and Freddie comprised the Cub battery and there was a plentiful slugging of the bail by both teams, as shown by the number of home runs. Josh, Kramer and Louie of the Band, and Tommy, and Jore of the Cubs each making a homer, Starting with the score 4—1 against them, the Band tied it in the third inning, and from that time on made a run, for each one made by their opponents, but, despite their struggles, the winning one could not be obtained by either club. Julius the little third baseman played in sensational style, making two difficult stops, and accepting every chance. It was a very exciting and well-played game, indicating what the tail-enders can do when they want to. John Henry and Ken were the umpires.
