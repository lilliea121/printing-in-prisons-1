WITHIN A FEW DAYS we will say goodbye to a young man who has been an inmate of this institution for nearly ten years. He came here an unformed boy, without money or friends, with only the rudiments of an education; without knowledge of a trade, or means of obtaining a proper livelihood; handicapped in every way for the real struggle with the world, which had worsted him in the very first encounter. His only asset was an alert mind and a strong determination to succeed. He leaves us, a bright, well-read, clearheaded young man, with an education that will enable him to fill with credit, an important position now awaiting him, while he is further fortified with the practical knowledge of a trade, which will render him at all times independent. His life while here should be a lesson to us all. The time he spent has not been wasted. He attended to his work, educated himself during his spare hours, and yet found ample time to lend a helping hand to many of his fellows. That he enjoys the confidence of the officials, and respect of the men, is a just recognition Of his earnest character. Deo volente he will leave us next Sunday, and we can only say, ‘‘Godspeed you, Timmy.”
