PLASTERERS vs LIBRARY The Plasterers played for a shutout, in their game with the Library today, ‘land with Yaller doing effective work in the box, had no difficulty in gaining their object. Mike started the pitching for the Jinglers, and after three runs had been made off his delivery in the first two innings, Charlie, who had been laid off some time ago, owing to an injury to his arm, entered the box, and held the Plasterers down to one hit and one run, during the remainder of the game. Twice the Bookmen had a man on third, and twice did they have men caught at third. Better judgment would have saved them from the ignominy of a shutout. Jingles has secured some pretty good players, among them, two very good pitchers, and with a better understanding among his men, and some drilling in the devious ways of modern baseball, ought to be making a movement toward the first division. The Plasterers played their usual good game, but, both Mike and Charlie, the Librarian slab-artists, had them guessing in the batting line, as they were only able to obtain five hits. Score, 4—0. Mack umpired the game in a decisive manner, that brooked no questions. —Mitch.
