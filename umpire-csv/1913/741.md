STARTLED PARDON BOARD.    A surprise was sprung on the Connecticut State Board of Pardons at the State Prison, in Weathersfleld, when Clifford H. Wilmarth, 26 years old, under sentence of two to three years for obtaining money under false pretenses, appeared. He based his plea for a pardon on a quotation from a book on American judiciary, written by Governor Baldwin, who was sitting with the Board as a member. His quotation was:    “Judges, who are neither able nor experienced, frequently impose sentences too light or too severe. We have too many such judges in the United States.”    Wilmarth was sentenced by Judge Joseph P. Tuttle of the Supreme Court, it being Judge Tuttle’s first day on the bench, following his appointment. For this reason, Wilmarth said, the judge was inexperienced. The Governor complimented Wilmarth, and said he had made a clear and able plea.
