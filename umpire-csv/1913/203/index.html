<h1>“Ducky” The Whole Show</h1>

<p>“DUCKY” THE WHOLE SHOW The Stocking Shed and the Plasterers played off their tie game on Tuesday, the 27th, ult, and it was a severe mauling for the former. Although the Plasterers made a host of runs, credit must not be too seriously attached to their good playing. The hero of the game was unquestionably a little fellow by the name of “Ducky.” He was the whole cheese, and virtually played the game alone. He pitched splendid ball but his support was abominable, and with everything against him; he struck eleven men out in grand style, also he got to third base very cleverly where he faded through no fault of his own. We were always in possession of the knowledge that ‘‘Ducky’’ was an ardent devotee of Base Ball, but not till lately did we realize that he has no peer inside these walls. He made some brilliant catches and altogether he was the talk of the town. The result was 9—1 which solitary run was made by Jack in the shape of a home run. —Henry.</p>
