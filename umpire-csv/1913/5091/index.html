<p>THE CHRISTMAS TRADE Prison Manufacturers Busy Preparing For the Annual Boom in Novelties The merchants and manufactures of this thriving town of Mackentieville, are not one whit behind others of their class, and are showing commendable activity in preparing for the annual holiday trade. Many really very handsome articles are being turned out by the workers in wood, bone, hair, worsteds, silks, metals etc., which ought to find quick sale at a fair profit. “Slim,” a colored man on the Seventh gallery has just completed a small power boat, which is equipped with a motor and batteries, cleverly concealed in the cabin. It is a particularly nice piece of work, when it is considered that his only knowledge of water-craft was gleaned along the raging canal and creeks of Berlin Md. A man on the Sixth block, has over one hundred pieces of beautiful inlaid work, valued at $1,200, while a tailor on the Seventh, has finished and under way a large number of boxes adapted to a variety of uses, and all splendid specimens of inlaid work. There are any number of men so employed, “and all working up to a high standard. Yeap, who has the reputation of turning out some of the best tidies and shawls in the institution is also receiving orders while Jake, who built and installed the tower clock, is hard at work on a number of ‘‘chime’’ clocks, which should find a ready sale. A man on the Seventh gallery is turning out some snakes, guaranteed to work the reformation of the worst inebriate, and he also has some wooden frogs, absolutely true to life, even to the ‘‘croak.”’ A few doors away from him, another industrious fellow is busy on miniature dressing cases and chiffoniers sure to delight the hearts of some little mothers. One of the lifetime men has completed a compilation of difficult arithmetical problems, with the answers fully worked out, which has been printed and bound in the prison printery, and now on sale by him. Many beautiful specimens of needlework are turned out in the Women’s department, and there is no doubt, a plentiful supply of men’s knitted scarfs, as well as sofa pillows, embroidered lingerie etc. Quite a few of the men are also adept in needle and bead work, and their product meets with ready sale. Breeders of canary birds also expect to do a prosperous business this year, for a good singer is an ideal Christmas present. The artists, and there are many, are working overtime on paintings and postcards, done in both oil water colors. and Expert penmen are ordering a fresh supply of implements of their craft, in expectation of doing a thriving business in their own special line. ‘The poets, headed by Spider and Jingles undertake to turn out bits of sentimental or any other kind of verse, adaptable to all occasions, guaranteed to give satisfaction, and finished, ‘‘while you wait.” Makers of all sorts of novelties, including shoe and glove buttoners; boats and figures in bottles; hair chains, pincushions, miniature boots and shoes; paper knives, jewelry etc., are all keeping busy along their respective lines, and all hoping to earn some real money by their ingenuity and industry. The Umpire will be glad to facilitate the sale of this product, in any way permissible under the rules. For those who are not adapted to any of this sort of work, and wish to earn a few dollars for the Christmas season, it is understood that there are a few vacancies in the Stocking Department, where capable men can earn from $4. per month upwards. With this immense country fairly rolling in wealth and opportunities, it will be strange indeed, if some of this money does not percolate through the walls of Mackentieville.</p>
