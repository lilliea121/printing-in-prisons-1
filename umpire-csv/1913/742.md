WOES OF THE PRISON EDITOR    The Editor of Lend A Hand has discovered that the work attached to the publication of a prison paper is not the “cinch job” so many imagine. He says:    Prison papers, like others, are supposed to be published for the benefit of humanity in general and the prisoners in particular, and to do justice to both is not always an easy matter. There are many things which perforce, must be left unsaid, and often, through prejudice, the wrong construction is placed on what is said. If we touch on politics our fingers are liable to become filthy from a growing evil. Should we praise the management of the prison for improvements they have made and humane treatment accorded the inmates, the men inside call us “suckers,” and those outside, say we do it because we have to, neither one of which is correct. Our position is one of trust, and we write, and print for a cause few men can understand or appreciate until they have been in our position.    This is a community of its own. We have desirable and undesirable; intelligents and ignorants; sane and insane; good citizens and bad; religious and non-religious; honest and dishonest; hypocrites and open countenance—just as you have in the town in which you live.       Some women remain faithful to their husband and some to their ideals.
