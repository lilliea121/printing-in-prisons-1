Yaller has entirely recovered from his recent sudden illness, and will soon be able to resume his place in the box for the Plasterers. He is a quiet, steady, conscientious worker, who has earned many friends. Prof. Wiegandt has secured the second floor of the Stocking Shed building for use as a Band room. It is a great improvement over the old quarters, in the matter of light, room and favorable acoustics. The men are equally as well pleased with the new surroundings as the Bandmaster.
