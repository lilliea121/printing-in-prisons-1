MY FAVORITES    You may talk of all your favorites In our National game of ball, Counting big leaguers, Amateurs, and all. But in these ten acres, It gives pleasure to us all, To watch the Ninth and Plasterers, In this famous game of ball. The’re fighting for supremacy, May the best team win at that, And its got to be decided With the famous ball and bat. And when they start to battle, T’ll be there you just can bet, Rooting for the Plasterers, And as near as Ican get. The Ninth will try with might and main; This third game they must get, But if I was a sporting man, On the Plasterers I would bet, And when the game is over And to our cells we go, You'll hear Oh, so many voices Saying, did’nt I tell you so! --Anon.
