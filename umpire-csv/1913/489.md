EVIL THOUGHTS    Evil thoughts are worse enemies than lions or tigers, for we can keep out of the way of wild beasts, but bad thoughts win their way everywhere. The cup that is full will hold no more; keep your head and heart full of good thoughts, and bad thoughts may find no room to enter. â€”B 6594.
