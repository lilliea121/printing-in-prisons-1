OUR ORCHESTRA    The men of the Fifth Block and Gallery desire to extend their thanks to the members of the Orchestra and the Quartette for the recent high class concert. It was without a doubt the best musical treat we have ever had, and the numbers were rendered in a most excellent manner, and so arranged as to have plenty of good stirring ragtime, as well as classical music. It was a great treat, and we only wish we could have one like it every Saturday night. —B 3369.       A woman’s idea of a good husband is one who never feels sorry for himself.
