A man without ambition is like a bird without wings. He can never soar in the heights above, but must walk like a weakling, unnoticed, with the crowd below.—Walter H. Cottingham.       Shun idleness, it is the rust that attaches itself to the most brilliant metals. The secret of success is the constancy of purpose.—Disracli.       Silence is golden.—To speak wisely may not always be easy,—but not to speak ill requires only silence.
