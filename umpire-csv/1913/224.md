STOCKING SHED 10, BAND 7    June 5    The Stocking Shed bowled the Band over today to the tune of 10-7. Bowl Foot, a new man went in to do the trick for the Sheds, but when the Band jumped on him for five runs in the third. he was taken out, and Spetz whirled the remaining innings. Walter was not in shape and the Shed won the game in the first two innings when they touched him up for seven runs. The Band is making a desperate uphill fight, and Dave and his crowd are to be commended. They are good losers. â€” Mitch.
