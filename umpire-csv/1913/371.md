DON’T BE A QUITTER    ADVERSITY has beaten you to the wall. You’re bruised, heartsick; the talons of doubt are kneeling at your throat; you've fought to the limit of your endurance; failure is leering from the background. But what of it ? same hour. We’ve all known the It comes to every man. There’s brass as well as gold in the sands of time. It’s up to you to show your metal. If you’re a weakling and a quitter, you'll surrender. But if you're a son of battle; if there’s a single surge of vitality and endurance left in your carcass, we'll see a man emerge from the trial. Where’s your second wind? If you can’t find it you’re lost. Anybody can smile and strive and persist when the game is in his favor, but genius and power are born in the brooding blackness of adversity. You aren't “gone” until you relinquish your ambitions. You aren’t downed until you surrender to yourself. There are few momentous lives not scarred with the memory of meager months. Hit out. Let us feel your force. We choose our masters and determine our servants by the ordeal of courage. It’s the eleventh hour. Quail at its challenge and all your tomorrows are yesterdays. —Herbert Kaufman.
