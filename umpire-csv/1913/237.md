An Awful Shame    To me it came, in denying shame,   When the Cubs beat the Plasterers once again,   If they could tell me how they beat,    No more pot pie, would I eat.   The Cubs, they played the game quite fair,    And fielding great, while I was there,   Their double plays and all the rest    Were up to the minute and of the best.   But in our national, game of ball,    The pace is fast, for one and all,   And thus it is; to all us men-    But can the Cubs, do it o'er again?    (Scat you're on my lettuce patch.)   -Snookums.
