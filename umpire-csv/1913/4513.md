MODEL PRISON STRUCTURES The federal prison at Leavenworth, Kansas, in which are housed prisoners of the United States, is a massive structure of steel and masonry containing 1,200 cells, each of which will hold two prisoners. The building of this great prison was begun fifteen years ago, and cost the government $4,000,000. More than 6,000,000 brick and several hundred tons of steel were used, and the masonry for the entire structure was made within the walls by the prisoners. The proposed new penitentiary at Joliet, Ill, will contain eight circular cell houses with glass roofs, instead of the regular ‘‘inside cell’’ type, are to be constructed in addition to the other necessary buildings. These houses will be 120 feet in diameter with four tiers of sixty cells, thus providing room for 240 prisoners in each house, or a total capacity for about 2,000 inmates.
