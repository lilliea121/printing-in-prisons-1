<p>GAMES OF AUGUST 1Ninth vs Library -- Cubs vs Band -- Plasterers vs Shed PLASTERERS SWAMP SHEDBig Ben started in the box for the Shed this afternoon and in the first two innings he passed six men, allowed five hits and seven runs, one a homer by Barber, and then retired to make way for little Spetz. The latter, though a trifle wild, was a big improvement over his predecessor, and managed to keep the Plasterers down to four runs during the remainder of the game. The little fellow also distinguished himself by making two double plays. However, the Ducklings were entirely outclassed and the Plasterers had no difficulty in rubbing it in by the score 11—3. A painful incident of the game, occurred when Curly caught a ball fielded from center, on his right cheekbone, and was forced to retire. Umpire, John Henry. —Mitch.</p>
