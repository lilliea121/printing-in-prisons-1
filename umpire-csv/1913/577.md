WHO’S WHO In Mackentieville    Who did bum work for the Umpire many a day, and set lots of bad type that was labor thrown away? Who wrote up the ball games, to roast players without fame, and sold out to Jingles, when he umpired one game? Who fired the boilers, to make light and steam and shoveled in coal till the fires did sure scream? Who blowed the old baritone horn, till it sprung a leak, and who’s now grinding socks alongside of Rattlesnake Pete? Who when he sees danger, is struck with a chill? Why, that pugilistic gent, that Easton Bill. By Himself.
