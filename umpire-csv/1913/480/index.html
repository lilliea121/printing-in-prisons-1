<p>LOCAL PICK-UPS Walter Johnson, of the Washington Americans has beaten, his own record by pitching fourteen consecutive winning games. Bill, Bess and Ned have been forced from their comfortable quarters through the steady advancement of the automobile, and the Stable is rapidly being transferred into an up-to-date Garage. The dogs and goats will also have to seek new quarters. An admirer of Rube has sent the following: It was noticed in the game between the Stocking Shed and Ninth Block, the great, and only Rube was on the hill for Ninth, and showed a marked improvement in his work. In 1911, he pitched one game for the Ninth, and that was enough, as he was soundly thrashed. On August 6, he held the Shed to a tie. If he keeps on improving, it is sure about December 1915 with the help of a small blizzard, he should be due to win a no-hit game. With the retirement of little Timmie, Duckie with his arm in a sling, little Freddie on crutches, Big Jack wearing goggles, Curley released, Yeap overworked, and other of the lesser lights showing the effects of too strenuous play, an opportunity for recuperation at this time is essential to the future life of our baseball games. The Board of Health of Philadelphia, has advised the people of this city to boil all water before using for drinking or cooking purposes, as typhoid is on the increase, and absolute care is necessary in the use of water. The water served to us from the truck, boiled, filtered, and iced, and the men should not use any other for drinking purposes. is After a prolonged sojourn, extending over twelve years, Jakey has concluded to seek other fields for the development of his talents, and will shake the dust of MacKentieville from off his feet on Friday next. No double entente is meant when we say that we are glad to see him go. He takes with him the best wishes of the men. Longie the star pitcher of the Ninth has not been very much in evidence during the recent games of his club. Looks as though there might be friction somewhere. The President of the Commission is a very busy man these days, and gaining some very valuable experience in the line of work he proposes taking up in the future. Manufacturing gravy-rolls. The best ’’finds‘‘ of the season, were Charlie of the Library, and little Ike of the Band. The former started off like a winner and was pitching good ball until the &quot;run-in which wrenched his pitching arm, and put him on the shelf. He now uses his right arm, but it is not nearly so effective as his left. He would do better if he received more encouragement for he undoubtedly feels his fall from popularity very keenly, the more so, that he knows the fault was not his own. Little Ike is a wonder. With all of the earmarks of a little country Rube he broke into the game with a freedom and dash that gained instant popularity for himself. It makes no difference where he plays he is on the job. The only fear is that he may lose his head through too much coddling, as everyone appears anxious to pat the little fellow on the back. A rumor to the effect that the Washington people had offered $100,000 for Ty Cobb, is announced as the work of Cobb’s value as a drawing card is on the wane, that gentleman’s press-agent. and it is up to him to devise some new stunts. Statisticians have discovered that there isa close connection between winning ball teams and the growth of cities. They present a formidable array of figures from which it appears conclusive, that a city supporting a winning ball team, has for many years showed a marked increase in population. The latest example being the city of Cleveland, which has under a recent census shown a remarkable growth which places it before Baltimore in the list of large cities. The unusually’ strong baseball team presented in the “‘Naps” this year it is claimed, is the governing cause of this growth.</p>
