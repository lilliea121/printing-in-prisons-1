SHED LOSE 3 STRAIGHT    July 11    It was no hard matter to obtain a seat in the grand stand today to see the combat between the 9th and Shed, because nearly everybody had migrated to the Stable ground in the expectancy of seeing the Cubs perform the hat trick upon the old veterans, which incidentally did not come to pass. Longie and Duckie pitched respectively and from the completion of the 1st inning there was no chance of the Shed winning. 13 runs were aggregated and 10 of them went to the Ninth’s credit; John (3), Eggie (2), Lefty (2), Augie, Longie and Betts. Duckie tried his best to keep the score down, but it was in vain that he hurled the sphere. He with Bob and Spetz made a trio of runs. —Henry.
