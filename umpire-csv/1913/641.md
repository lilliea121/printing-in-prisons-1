FOR DESSERT Unless your thanksgiving be from the heart, it is void and empty. Not a full purse, but a full life gives to one the material for thankfulness. Let it not be forgotten that the best sauces for the Thanksgiving dinner are love and gentleness. Thanksgiving is saddened for the mother if even one of her living be missing from the fold. He who cannot be thankful in adversity stands convicted of selfishness. On this day let us remember that the germ of misery is oftener found in wine than in water, The prayer that springs from the heart never fails to carry all the way to Heaven. It were better to have a little to be thankful for, than to have lost the will to be thankful for even a little. E Some men fall in love and never get on their feet again. Many a girl deludes herself with the belief that she has completed her education before she marries A curious thing about horses is that those you bet on generally cost you more than those you buy. â€”The Cockerel
