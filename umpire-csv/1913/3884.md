If the followers of the Band, Stocking Shed, Library and Cubs, are disappointed in not seeing an account of the game of their respective clubs in the Umpire, they will have to bear with us. Our correspondents are very willing to report the games, providing they can select the game; and as a rule, they all select the best game. The Editor has as much influence with his staff, as the Ninth Block has with the umpires.
