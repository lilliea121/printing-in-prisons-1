BAND vs SHED    June 30    The Shed could not hold the Band down; somehow they seemed to have a terrific burst of speed in their playing today. With Big Louie on the mound for the Band, and Herman, and the Rabbi for the Shed, there was a pitchers battle. Jimmy of the Shed had a brilliant two-base hit, scoring two men on it, and later scoring himself. Big Slim excelled for the Band, both at the bat and in the field. The biggest sensation of the game was Josh, sliding halfway from second to third, amid a cloud of dust. Later, Big Six tried the same stunt, but he was not as slippery as Josh, and was caught afoot from the sack. Score 6-—4 Umpires—Happy, Ken. —Bill.
