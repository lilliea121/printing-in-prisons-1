<p>PAROLE MEN MAKING GOOD A committee of which Mr. Edwin M. Abbott, Judge Robert Ralston, and State Senator, Samuel W. Salus of Philadelphia, were members recently submitted a very comprehensive report on the operations and effect of the laws in relation to the ‘Indeterminate sentence, and Release on parole.”’ The report stated among other things, that ‘‘the result of the year’s work has been one of encouragement. Reports from parole officers and others having charge of the work in the various states show no diminution in the numbers of paroled prisoners now leading law-abiding lives throughout the entire country. Nearly 80 per cent of paroled prisoners have made good.” “In Pennsylvania, parole, boards have jurisdiction in making rules and regulations relating to paroled prisoners. Heretofore these boards have insisted that a sponsor be obtained by each prisoner before being paroled. As a result, many worthy prisoners have been compelled to serve out the greater part of their maximum sentence, entailing great hardship. The last Legislature has curtailed this power and prescribed that where the prisoner cannot obtain a sponsor, and that is the only reason for his remaining over the minimum term, then the board shall procure a sponsor for him, and he shall be entitled to parole.</p>
