Notice      We ask the cooperation of the managers and players, to aid the official scorers as much as possible, by obtaining for them a good vantage point in which to witness all the plays; a so to give them your correct batting list, and any changes which may occur during the game. It is to your benefit that you should do this, if you wish a correct account, kept of the batting, fielding and base running during the season. The work of an official scorer is rather an intricate and troublesome one, and mistakes will no doubt occur, but with the help of the managers players, and umpires, a great many of them can be eliminated.
