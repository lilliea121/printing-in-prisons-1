NINTH vs PLASTERERS    July 3    A game, devoid of interest after the first inning had been negotiated, was played today between the above teams. Longy, fresh from a good rest was pitted against the old ‘War Horse’’. His pitching was somewhat wild, but one way or another their opponents were held down to nil. Curley was in good form, but weakened a little at times. The fielding on both sides was good, Rube, John and Augie made home run swats. Timmy, Eggy and someone else, each scored, Rube tripled, and Augie doubled. For the Plasterers, the Barber got to third and faded; Alec got to third exceedingly clever, and fooled Longy in the passing. With all his cuteness he was immediately caught trying to get away with a practical impossibility. Throughout the whole combat, no exciting situation presented itself. With the exception of one hit which materialized on error, Longy pitched a no hit, no run game. Result 6-0 favor of Ninth. — Henry.
