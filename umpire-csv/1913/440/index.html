<p>NINTH 9 BAND 1 Davis went into the Band box on Monday afternoon and held the formidable Ninth scoreless until the fifth inning, when his support blew up and four runs came over the plate, one a homer by Cap, who repeated the performance in the next inning. In the seventh Julius tried a little bit of cricket tossing for the Band, which resulted in four more tallies for the Ninth, one of them a home run by Rube, with a beauty clean over the east wall. The Band led off with a single run in the first, and from that time on to the fifth played ball like veterans, when they simply went to pieces. Slim, their long-legged first baseman, being particularly awkward, and in need of ginger. Brownie did the honors for the Ninth, and while he was hit freely, by every one of the Bandsmen, his support was so good that only one run could be charged against him. Score 9—1. Umpire, Lippy. —Mitch.</p>
