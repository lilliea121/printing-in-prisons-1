  Two prisoners who had been sent to Chicago to undergo an operation for the
  cure of moral delinquencies have been pronounced cured. The judge stated that
  he would parole the men and have their actions carefully watched, but he
  believe they are now morally regenerated. If this theory is correct, he says
  more prisoners will be sent to the operating table, than to jails.
