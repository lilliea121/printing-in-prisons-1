Just Try To Be The Fellow That Your Mother Thinks You Are   Whilst walking down a crowded city street   the other day,   I heard a little urchin to a comrade turn and   say-   "Say, Chimmey, lemme tell youse, I'd be   happy as a clam   If I only was the fellow dat me mudder tinks   I am,   She tinks I am a wonder, an' she knows her   little lad   Could never mix wit' nutting dat was ugly   mean or bad.   Oh lots o' times I set and tink, how nice   'twould be, gee whiz!   If a feller was de feller that his mudder tinks   he is."   My friends, be yours a life of toil, or undiluted joy,   You still can learn a lesson from this small   unlettered boy.   Donâ€™t try to be an earthly saint with eyes fixed on the stars,   Just try to be the fellow that your mother   thinks yon are. -Will S. Adkin.
