IT IS SUGGESTED to the men who have novelties for sale, that they price their wares as low as possible. Several criticisms have been heard in regard to the absurdly high valuation placed upon some articles manufactured by them, and sales have been lost in consequence. Prospective customers coming here do not want to be placed in a position of “ haggling,” and the first price asked should be the very lowest, consistent with a fair profit. Remember, it is “demand” which regulates the values, and be prepared to meet it, rather than hold your stock.
