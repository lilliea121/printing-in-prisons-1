VANDALS AT WORK AGAIN    Some unknown person, or persons unknown, have been committing depredations in this neighborhood with frequent regularity, to the annoyance of our best citizens. Last Sunday, some heartless hoodlum had the brazen gall to break a cherished medicine glass—same size as Mike puts on the bar. It may seem a small matter to the unconcerned, but, it took seventeen years to collect the half dozen that were guaranteed to be new. —Rocky
