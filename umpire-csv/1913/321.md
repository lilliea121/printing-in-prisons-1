Cubs vs Stocking SHED July 14 A very snappy game was played today, between the above teams, and. although the Cubs were victorious, it cast no reflection upon their opponents, who played equally as good as the Cubs, with the one exception of batting, in which they were outclassed. The Shed were in hard luck, otherwise they certainly would have scored some runs. Eight innings were played and were dispatched as quick as wheels are changed at movies. Tommy pitched high-class ball, and his support was peerless, several of the men making brilliant plays. Ducky was in the box for the Shedmen and pitched a fair game. He allowed several free passes, but taking all things together, his team played a steady and consistent game. His support was well maintained, with only one error. The result was 8—0 in favor of Cubs, but it is no criterion from which to judge the remaining two games that will be played between these teams during the week. —Henry.
