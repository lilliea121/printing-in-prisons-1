THE HOME THAT IS WAITING    There is a dear old mother in that home so sweet and bright, awaiting for your coming each day, and every night As you sit in your tiny cell, thinking of your future flight, wondering where you'll lay your head, when freedom calls you in the night. Though you have failed in your manhood, and have gotten in wrong with the “gang,” yet there is still a home and Mother, willing to make of you a man. So cheer up, my boy, and be of good cheer, for there is always a home waiting for you and work is in abundance—I don’t think. B 6722       I’d rather be a Could Be    If I could not be an Are.    For a Could Be is a May Be,    With a chance of touching par.    I’d rather be a Has Been,    Than a Might Have Been by far,    For a Might Have Been; has never been,    But a Has, was once an Are.
