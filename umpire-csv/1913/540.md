MOMENTS REALLY LIVED You will find, as you look back upon ;your life, that the moments when you have really lived are the moments when you have done things in a spirit of love. As memory scans the past, above and beyond all the transitory pleasures of life, there leap forward those supreme hours when you have been enabled to do unnoticed kindnesses to those round about you, things too trifling to speak about, but which you feel have entered into your eternal life. â€”B 6594 It is said by one who knows that the hardest way to get money, is to steal it; the next hardest way, is to marry it.
