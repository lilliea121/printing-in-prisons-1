LEND A HAND    If you cannot lend a dollar to some chap who cannot pay,    If you cannot place a quarter or a dime at his command,    You can help him meet his troubles in a very simple way; Lend a hand! Tend a hand! If he’s trembling on precipice, Or is facing some temptation you are sure he can’t withstand, There’s a loan perhaps will save him from his ruin, and it’s this: Lend a hand! the verge of some moral Lend a hand! Or perhaps he’s gone the limit and is hopeless in his dole— Down and out, a moral wreck amid the driftwood of the strand— It is then his need is greatest, for the comfort of his soul, Lend a hand! Lend a hand! —J. K. Bangs.
