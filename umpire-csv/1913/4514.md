WHO’S WHO In Mackentieville Who has old Edison by the nose, when it comes to talk about dynamos? Who likewise has him tied in knots, when the subject’s one of kilowatts? Who knows the armature’s business end, and just what’s the smatter, when the juice won’t send? Who turned the current into our baseball games, and then kept tab on the Poet’s ‘‘frames?” Who loves a boost, but dreads a knock? Why, that baseball gent, that electrical Doc.
