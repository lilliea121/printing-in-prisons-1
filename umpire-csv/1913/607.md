B 5755:-The two words you mention are both in Webster’s Unabridged Dictionary. Etui, pronounced a-twee, and also spelled etwee; a case for small articles, such as pins, needles etc.; a lady’s reticule, or work-box. Ergat, is from the Latin ergo, meaning to draw conclusions from. Both words are so little used as to be almost obsolete, but they are both proper English words.
