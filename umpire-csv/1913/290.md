NINTH VS LIBRARY June 25 A game of only moderate good play, was the product of the above contest, and although it was anybody’s game clear up to the finish, the Ninth were well established on the winning side. They used their usual strong lineup; but they were kept fairly well in hand, as regards runs, by the Library. They scored three runs, two of which were obtained by Longy; one being a bounding lick, and the other the outcome of a three-bagger. Longey batting much more consistently than he did last season. Although his pitching was not ‘‘of the first water,’’ he worked hard, both in the box and at the bat, and to him must be attributed the victory today. The other run was made by Ban, who scored on Longy’s treble. The result of the Librarian’s play today was nil, and hardly once, except when Bob was permitted to occupy third base, was there the slightest sign of them scoring. Mike pitched a good game, but a feeling of unrest was upon the whole team. —Henry.
