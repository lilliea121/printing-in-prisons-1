Thrift of time will repay you in afterlife, with a thousand fold profit, beyond your most sanguine dreams.— William E. Gladstone.      He who has conferred a kindness should be silent; he who has received one should speak of it.—Seneca.       Never attempt to bear more than one kind of trouble at once. Some people bear three kinds—all they have had, all they have now, and all they expect to have.—Edward Everett Hale.
