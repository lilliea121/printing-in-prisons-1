There will be a real " sane Fourth " in MacKentieville alright , alright.   No order on the storekeeper for Fourth of July crackers will be honored. Application should be made to the diet kitchen.   Among the pyrotechnics to be displayed here will be one of an oratorical nature, but confined to the intimates of the Preacher, fourth gallery.   Aleck, of the boiler house promises something brilliant in the way of vocal fireworks to be accompanied by an extra strong odor of brimstone. He is expert in this line ordinarily, and when he   exerts himself the result should be a masterpiece.      Always use noiseless cartridges.
