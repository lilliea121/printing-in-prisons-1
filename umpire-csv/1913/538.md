WITH THE POETS   MOTHER’S FACE   Three little lads in converse loud engaged, One sunny summer day. And out of window low, I thought I’d lean. To hear what they might say. “The prettiest thing on earth I ever saw,”’ One of the wee boys said, “In Grandma’s garden was a lovely bird, All yellow, black and red.” “The prettiest thing that I have ever seen on earth,” So spoke another lad, “It is a pony at the circus grounds— I want him awful bad!”    “I think,” the third bright little fellow said, With unaffected grace, “The prettiest thing to me in all the world. Is just my mother’s face!” —Pliny.
