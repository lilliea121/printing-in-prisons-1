FORWARD    Let us have done with vain regrets and longings for the days that will never be ours again. Our work lies in front, not behind us; and “forward” is our motto. Let us not sit with folded hands gazing upon the past as if it were the building; it is but the foundation. Let us not waste heart and life thinking of what might have been, and forgetting the ‘‘may be’’ that lies before us. —B 6594.
