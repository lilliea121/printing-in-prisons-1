Billy Sunday says: ‘‘That some people are so stingy, that if you ask them to sing ‘Old Hundred’, they will sing ‘Ninety and Nine’ to save one cent.’’       A London man says his wife is so thin he has to tie her in a knot before he can kiss her —Good Night !       When the parole men were being disharged recently, Doc, Jack and Paddy, of the Boiler House, were whistling a song called; ‘‘You’ll Come Back.’’ Can’t imagine who they were alluding to.       Mark Twain said:— ‘‘Be good and you will be lonesome.’’ He evidently never investigated the causes leading to the Klondyke [Klondike] and and the loneliness therein.       MSS. Accepted: ‘‘Amid Grim Walls’’ by H. F. M.; “Procrastination” by Pliny; “An Interview” and “Escaped” by Rocky.
