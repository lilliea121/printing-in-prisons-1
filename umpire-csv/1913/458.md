GAMES OF AUGUST 15    Plasterers vs Cubs—Ninth vs Shed -- Band vs Library    CUBS DEFEATED The Plasterers, and Cubs met for the last game of the week’s series on Friday, and the former secured an easy victory by the score 5—2. Tommy and Yaller pitched, for their respective teams, and both men felt the strain of overwork, especially Tommie, who appeared entirely outdone, and although he did his best, he was no match for the husky Plasterers. The latter scored five runs, by Andy, (2) Augie, Barber, and Felix. The Cubs were held down to the fifth inning when Woody scored the first run, No further runs were tallied on either side until the last inning when Jore came home for the Cubs. Umpire, Mack. —Millsy
