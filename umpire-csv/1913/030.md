A Few Pointers      If you have no respect for yourself, you cannot expect to be respected by the others.   Applicants for position of umpire, should communicate with "Doc", at the Engine Room.   Sometimes we have a feeling, that it is up to the others to do unto us, as they would have us do unto them.   Keep a brave heart! Remember that even the cuffs of fortune are sometimes reversible.   "There is so much good in the worst of us, and so much bad in the best of us that it does not behoove any of us to talk about the rest of us.”   The topic of conversation today is, "What did the Legislature do yesterday?" A month hence it will be, "What's the score?"   If "Denver Eddie" wants to be an umpire this season, he'll have to stay away from the Lime Shed. "Do you get that, Eddie?"   "And how is Slick getting along, Mr. Loan?"   "Oh, fine; he’s a, hustler."   "Indeed ! That's news; perhaps it's his wonderful delivery qualities, hey?"    "Yes, that's it. He's one of the surest catchers and throwers on the Ninth Block Team."   The first player to be drafted this season was "Pop", third baseman of the Ninth. The Ninth at first thought of entering a protest, but after considering the matter more fully, decided to abide by the decision of the Board of Pardons.
