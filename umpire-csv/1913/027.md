A Necessary QuestionThe case had reached a critical stage. Even the Judge seemed to awaken to a live interest in the proceedings, for the most important witness was about to Be cross-examined."So you are the lady's maid?" began the relentless lawyer."Yes, sir."“And where were you at 7 o'clock on the evening in question?"“I was in my lady's room, sir;"“For what purpose?"“I was dressing my lady's hair, sir."The lawyer leaned forward and spoke slowly and impressively.“Now, think," he said. “I want you to be very careful in answering this question. Was or was not your mistress in the room at the time?" -Cleveland Leader.
