WITH THE POETS SPIDER ANSWERS THE GANG Have you ever heard of the ‘Skylight man?” Of course you have, he’s a baseball fan. About baseball not a thing he knows, Yet he yells and roots and wiggles his toes. At the start of the season you’d hear him say “The Ninth will win—are here to stay.” But the rest of the gang kept pushing him, Saying, ‘just wait, a new song you'll sing;’’ Well, here is where that song will begin, And I hope in your ears forever will ring, I might be a mut on the baseball game Not looking for laurels, or any fame. When it comes to stalling or a game to frame I’m only a dub, and very tame, But here is my answer to all the gang: Your judgment was bum from beginning to end A game of marbles, you might play that— But a game of ball, you don’t know, that’s a fact. ; Don’t come around with your hard luck cry You simply lost out; in the fight you did die. A gang of has-beens, you struck a snag From this time on, you better play tag. — Spider
