BAND vs NINTH    June 9    Monday’s game was hardly the kind to fill the grandstands. It was very spiritless until the last two innings and although considerable scoring was then rolled up it was hardly the result of brilliant work. The only run the Band tallied was in the first inning when little Julius came home; the team then went to sleep excepting the pitcher who did good work until the last two innings when he became wild, Failure to catch, and fumbling the balls by the Band helped the Ninth considerably. Jack’s run was entirely due to the second baseman fumbling the ball on which he came home. The very opposite occurred in the last inning when a brilliant throw by Rube caught Josh at second base. It was the prettiest play of the game. Yeap, Smithie, Sam and Brownie are the others that made runs for the Ninth bringing the score up to 5-1. ——Sam.
