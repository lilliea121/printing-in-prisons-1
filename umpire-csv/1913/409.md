NINTH BLOCK STILL LEADING IN THE PENNANT RACE    Plasterers and Cubs Library and Band Doing Battle— Ninth Going Along Easy With the Shed    The Library had the Band beaten up to the seventh inning in last Monday’s game, when Ban, who had held his opponents down to one run and two hits, blew up, allowed one single, 2 two-baggers and a pass, resulting in three runs, and making the game a tie, by the score of 4—4. Both teams played fine ball, and undoubtedly felt the effects of the ideally beautiful weather, for their actions were full of vim and vigor, and the game went forward so smoothly that seven and one-half innings were played during the hour. The feature of the game was Bobbie’s hit to the roof, scarcely twenty feet away which counted for three bases, and his successful steal home, under the catchers arms. Umpire, the only John Henry. —Mitch.
