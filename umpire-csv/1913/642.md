Wines—OLD PORT—Ree    THE HOLIDAY SEASON    The holiday season is coming, Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year, Our friends will come a-running, To infuse in us good cheer, There’s no reason to be sad or dreary, Better days are coming never fear, Why should you be lonesome and weary, Just think of the good things right here? Apples, roast pork and Dutch cake! We all know are really quite sure. The Band concert will surely make You feel quite rich—not poor. The Umpire’s special number, Is bound to be a treat, And when time comes for slumber, You'll say, “this can't be beat.” And when you're gone, and far away, Of Mackentieville you'll think, But the honest fact, it does not pay, Don’t let your good thoughts sink, And when you yearn for pot-pie, There’s Childs’ and Dennet's and Mink, Where you can get an oyster fry, That'll remove that aching “kink.” Morar But while you're here you must not fret, Remember there are others, Just take it calm, and you can bet, You'll cheer your sorrowing brothers. After the storm the sun will shine, So does the proverb read, And everything will come out fine, If this moral you will heed. —Jingles
