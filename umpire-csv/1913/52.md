Make Good      Make Good   Cut out "if, " "could -." and "should,"   And start in to saw wood.   You can still have the best Things in life, like the rest   Of the men who've achieved Just because they've believed In themselves. You're deceived If you think fortune comes With a rattle of drums   And a fanfare of state   To hand yours on a plate.   That isn't the way   That she visits today.   You must get out and rustle, bustle;   and hustle;   You'll need all your muscle for you've got to   tussle.   Plunge into the fight,   Hit to left and to right   And keep crashing, and smashing:   Don't let up with your striking   Till things meet your liking.   For God's sake, stop bawling-   Instead, no some mauling.   It makes the world bitter   To look at a quitter;   Fate scowls when she sees   A grown up on his knees   A man with his health   Is a mine jammed with wealth   Full of unexplored lodes,   Why, the freckled-back toads   Have the sense to keep jumping-   And hear you are frumping.   Come now, strike your gait--It isn't too late,   There's no such thing as fate! Drop that fool-talk of luck,"   Get a grip on your pluck,   And buck. Begin   To grin, And win.
