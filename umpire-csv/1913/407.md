BOOKIES LOSE ANOTHER    The Librarians and Ninth met for the last game of the week’s series, and a finer contest for supremacy, has hardly been witnessed on the Ninth block grounds this season the game going seven innings. Both teams played splendid ball. Longie and Charlie were in the box for the Ninth and Library, and both were in good form, and twirled splendid ball; Longie struck out fourteen men, while Charlie had six to his credit. The most remarkable feature of the game, was five fly balls over the first block roof, and all five caught; three by Bob, for the Library; and two by Chef, for the Ninth. Neither side scored until the fifth, when Brownie tallied the first run for the Ninth. In the fifth Eggie drove a ball over the first block roof, making a home run. Big Jack also scored in this inning on an error. In the first half of the seventh inning, Beef Trust drove a vicious ball over the first block roof, and at the last report the ball was moving yet, making a home run, and bringing Ban home, who had received free transportation. Mack the Umpire, did splendid work, both behind the bat and on bases. Score 3—2. —Millsy.
