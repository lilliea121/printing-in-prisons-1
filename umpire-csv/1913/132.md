PLASTERERS vs BAND    Plasterers Run Away With Band, as Poet is a Poor Judge of Players    To slow music the Bear-cats waltzed the Bandits around the garage ball room, A very good game was played and the fifers showed improvement. Smiling Tony pitched for the winners, and did well. Without apparent effort he puzzled opposing batters. Both teams hit the ball hard in spots. Seven runs were the fruitage of good batting by Bear Cats. In the first, Dave hit, and went out stealing third. Stump passed, Felix hit, and Jim sent him across the plate with a hard rap to the Balkan States for a homer. In the third, Tony, Felix, Jim, Tim, and Fatty each hit. It looked as though they intended to bat the clock around. Jim and Tim hit again in fifth. In the sixth, Dave doubled. Bandits score 2 runs. In fourth inning, Dave, catcher, doubled, and Big Six whaled out a home run that made the hands on the clock tower finally move. Harry hit. During the game, Big Six, Jack, and Harry doubled. Fattyâ€™s great sliding has the street cleaning department beat a mile.
