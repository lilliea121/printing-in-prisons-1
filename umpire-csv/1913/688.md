PAROLED MEN SUPPORT WIVES    “It’s a success,” said Karl L. Schreiber, parole officer or the pardon and parole board of Kansas City Mo., recently in referring to the system recently adopted. Men who spend their money in saloons and gambling places and then get into trouble are paroled after being fined and sentenced to the municipal farm, provided they have families dependent on them and are willing to contribute part of their earnings to their support. The system was put into effect two or three months ago. Mr. Schreiber now receives about 4400 a week from men so paroled and turns it over at once to the wives and children. Instead of spending the time in the workhouse, leaving the families dependent on charity, the better system of giving the men another chance was adopted.
