STICK TO WATER Weak men like whiskey, also water, and sometimes both. Strong men never rely on stimulants. Most ‘‘drinking” men are weak men. Some drink because it is the custom, some because they are treated, some because they don’t want to appear too virtuous, and some because they wrongly imagine that it adds to their strength. In any of these cases drinking is a sign of weakness. Man is the only animal that eats when he is not hungry, and drinks when he is not thirsty. Very few men drink because they like the taste of liquor. Drinking is often the result of a false thirst. When the system cries for water, men translate the demand for fluid into a call for rum. Water will quench most any thirst. But—this was not to be a Temperance Lecture, but a brief paragraph to call attention to the too frequently formed drinking habit and its dire results, as exemplified in so many instances in this and other similar Institutions. —Pliny
