WITH THE POETS    I HAVE LOVED FLOWERS THAT FADE    By ROBERT BRIDGES I have loved flowers that fade, Within whose magic tents Rich hues have marriage made With sweet unmemoried scents: A honeymoon delight— A joy of love at sight, That ages in an hour— My song be like a flower! I have loved airs that die Before their charm is writ Upon a liquid sky Trembling to welcome it. Notes that, with pulse of fire, Proclaim the spirit’s desire, Then die and are nowhere— My song be like an air! Die, song, die like a breath, And wither like a bloom; Fear not a flowery death, Dread not an airy tomb ! Fly with delight, fly hence ! Twas thine love’s tender sense To feast; now on thy bier Beauty shall shed a tear.       Robert Bridges has just been designated as the Poet Laureate of Great Britain, a position of honor greatly sought by eminent literary men.
