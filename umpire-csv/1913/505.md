KNOWLEDGE Keep up all knowledge you have acquired, and gain as much. more as you can. By reading you will be distinguished: without it, abilities are of little use. A man may talk and write, but he cannot learn his profession without constant study to prepare; especially for the higher ranks, because there he wants the knowledge and experience of his own improved by that of others. But when in a post of responsibility he has no time to read, and if he comes to such a post with an empty skull, it is then too late to fill it, and he makes no figure. Thus many people fail to distinguish themselves and say they are unfortunate, which is untrue. Their own previous idleness has unfitted them to profit from fortune. â€”B 6594.
