STUDIES IN JAIL    Every night in a cell at the penitentiary at Lansing a convict turns the pages of a book entitled “Introductory Pharmacy” with hard, rough hands which have spent a long, weary day mining coal.    For one and a half years this prisoner has spent every moment of his spare time sitting on a hard bench in his cell mastering the principles of pharmacy, according to instructions sent him each week by the Extension Department of the University of Kansas. He has just finished the first part of his course and by the time his term is served he will be able to go out into the world and take a responsible position in a drug store.
