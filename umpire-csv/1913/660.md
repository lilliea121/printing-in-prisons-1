A CARD    Editor the Umpire: Would you please be so kind as to publish in the columns of your paper the thanks of B 6299 to all the boys that helped him at the time of his recent accident. B 6299      The pessimistâ€™s idea of a good time is to sit down and think about the good times he might have had.    Why should a man let a woman make a fool of him, when he can do it almost as successfully himself?
