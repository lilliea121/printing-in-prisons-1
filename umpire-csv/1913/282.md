BAND SLAUGHTERED    June 27    In a fairly well contested game that was badly marred by unnecessary wrangling, the Cubs downed the Band today by the score 7—1. The Musicians used both Louie and Ban, in the box, but, the Cubs hit both of them at will, and aided by the generally poor work of the Band, had no trouble in winning, hands down. — Henry.
