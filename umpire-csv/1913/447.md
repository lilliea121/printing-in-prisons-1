A certain dignity of manner is absolutely necessary, to make even the most valuable character, either respectable, or respected, in the world. —Lord Chesterfield.       I pity no man because he has no work. If he is worth his salt, he will work. I envy the man who has a work worth doing, and does it well.— Theodore Roosevelt.
