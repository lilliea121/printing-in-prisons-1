THERE SEEMS to be a deliberate plan on the part of certain Philadelphia newspapers to place the inmates of this prison before the public in a light as unfavorable as possible.    For the past six weeks there has been almost daily reference to the so-called “jail delivery” here last October, and this has been bolstered up with a running fire of criticism of the parole law ; doubts as to the reformation of the discharged men and expressions reflecting upon the prison and its inmates.    Last Thursday one of the papers stated that on Thanksgiving day we would be regaled with a dinner consisting of roast beef, celery, baked sweet potatoes, mashed white potatoes, fruits, pudding, pie, coffee and cigars.    This we all know is not the truth, and in view of the want and distress among the poor of this city, and the fact that many families in even moderate circumstances did not have a dinner very much better, if as good, as that actually served to us, it needs but a few more untruthful statements of the sort to start a vigilance committee the direction of Cherry Hill. If there is one thing calculated to make the blood of the average citizen sizzle up around the boiling point, it is the report that he is being taxed to support convicts in pampered idleness. Yet it is very evident this is exactly the impression a number of newspapers are endeavoring to create.
