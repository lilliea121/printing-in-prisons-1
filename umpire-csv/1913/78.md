Band vs. PlasterersApril 9The Plasterers made a "Horrible example" of the Band in a game at the Store Honse on Thursday, which game was postponed from the day previous,on account of work being done at the Ninth Block. We never knew so many errors could be made in one game. Herman's knuckle ball was seen very frequently out around the watch box, and over in the Fifth Block yards. The Band should try and strengthen some of the weak places, beginning at the catcher and continuing right through the whole team. The catcher is a ·hard worker, and should be encouraged. Why don't they try Tody back of the bat, and shift the catcher to some other position for a while, and see how it works? Let Reading put some ginger in his work. He is a good player, but oh, so tired. In an interview with an Umpire correspondent, after the game, Herman was very indignant, at what he termed the "double crossing" of Dave, manager of · the Plasterers. On being questioned further as to just what he referred to, we learned that he bad given Dave a half dozen cigars to strike out three times. Dave carried out the agreement twice, but could not reach the ball the other time at the bat, without exciting suspicion, and had to take his base on balls. Herman ought to make a deal with Harry, the catcher, whereby he will give him six cigars every time he hits the ball. Soft pickings, Herman.PLASTERERSA. B.R. H. 0. A.
