AFTERMATHThe Giants used 20 men in the series,to the Athletic’s 12. Eddie Plank, who has announced his intentions of retiring from baseball, certainly went out in a blaze of glory such as never attended the exit of any other player. The Athletics were mobbed by a crowd the field, and on the. bases, the latter of about 4000 enthusiastic ‘‘fans” upon their arrival in this city from New York, last Saturday night. They were hugged and kissed and carried upon stalwart shoulders to Shibe Park, where a gorgeous exhibition of fireworks accompanied by several bands of music was in progress, and the crowd being thus diverted, the White Elephants beat it for their own domiciles and domesticity. Wally Schang and Joe Leslie Bush, have each bought a buzz wagon, and are busy learning all about ignitions, carburetors, and speed limit laws. The Mackmen have decided to split even with every member of the team, regardless of the length of time in service This is in marked contrast with the Giants, who will only allow men in the game for one year a half share.
