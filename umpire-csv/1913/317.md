JINGLE BELLS NOT IN IT    July 3    The Cubs gave the Library another gentle shove toward the bottom, to-day when they defeated the Jingle bells by the score of 6—2. The Cubs’ simply toyed with their opponents and won as they pleased. The Library is badly handicapped by the lack of able pitchers, and until this defect is remedied, must be satisfied to hug tight to last place. Jingles, their manager, makes a pathetic plea for both patience and encouragement on the part of the fans, and _ prophesies that his men will yet make good. — Bill.       Time is money. Welcome is that visitor who appreciates the value of another’s time.
