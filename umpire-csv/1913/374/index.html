<p>BASE-BALL BUG Say, stop, look, and listen, you baseball fans to me, Tis a funny little story, I’m going to tell to thee:  It’s all about a baseball bug you’ll see, Who built his reputation in the E. S. P. Last year he was a terror, with his big long mace, He sent the sphere a flying, all around this place. When opposing batsmen fanned, you could hear him say, ‘‘set down,”’ But now we have him figured, as a full-fledged clown— He looks to be a demon as he steps up to the plate, But he hasn’t made a decent hit, we’ve noticed here of late. When you ask him what’s the matter, you will ; hear him softly cry, “I've been traded ’round so often, ’till I’ve lost my batting eye.” Now he’s playing with the Library, and if he don’t advance I’m sorry, but I’m forced to say, it’s his last chance. Now Fats, quit your kidding, shut your face up like a clam, The gang has all concluded, that you’re nothing but a “ham.” —Rufus</p>
