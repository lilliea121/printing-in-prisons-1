PLASTERERS WIN AGAIN    June 9.    The Plasterers today lined up Tony and Stump, against Yellow and Beef Trust for the Librarians and won out by the score 3-2.    The whistle blew in the last half of the seventh with Eggie, a famous runner on third, two men down, and Big Six at the bat. As the latter had knocked out a home run in the third, he would have undoubtedly saved the game had there been time, for only a single was needed to tie it up, at least. Both Tony and Yellow were going well, but there was some very ragged fielding, and base running Mike of the Librarians, who has usually played good ball, making errors of peculiar flagrancy to say the least.    The Plasterers made their three runs in the first inning, and only in two other innings, did one of their men reach 3rd. Tony struck out 9, Yellow 7. Big Six, Tony and Aleck carried off the batting honors. Umpires, John Henry and Neil. â€” Mitch
