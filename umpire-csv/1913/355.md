GAMES OF JULY 16    Ninth vs Band -- Cubs vs Shed -- Plasterers vs Library    BAND COULDN’T HIT    Bill went into the box for the Ninth today in their game against the Band, and while the latter fielded well, could do nothing in the hit line. Yeap, who had not entirely recovered from the blow received on his pitching arm a few days before, was on the slab for the Bandmen, but was relieved in the sixth inning by B 6660, a new man, who showed up well. Both teams played good ball, and though the Ninth succeeded in shutting out their opponents, at the conclusion they knew they had been in a battle. The sensational feature of the game was a magnificent throw by Rodge, from center field, to the plate, just in time to cut off Rube’s home run. Score 6—0. Umpires, John Henry—Smithy.    —Bill.
