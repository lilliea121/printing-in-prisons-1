Play Ten Innings without a ScoreIn a ten inning scoreless battle, between Penn Varsity and a Scrub Team, the Scrub pitchers held the Varsity team at two hits. Mike Doolan, the Phillies short-stop, played short-stop for the scrubs, but failed to register a hit off the Varsity pitchers. The Penn baseball men have never owed up nearly so well at this early in any previous season.
