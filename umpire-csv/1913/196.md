GOT A LEMON    He was a poor and ragged tramp. His hat was bad, his shoes were damp; And, as he sped adown the street, He looked about for aught to eat. And, as he gazed into the air, He saw a lady, passing fair, “Passing for fair,” she was, all right— He had to run to ask for a bite. She turned and thrilled him with her eyes, And extended a palm that many would prize    And he saw, as he gave a painful lurch,    That the palm she had, was just brought from church. --Timmy, et al.
