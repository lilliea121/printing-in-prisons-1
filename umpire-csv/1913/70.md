SCREAM. There was a little boy and he thought he could play ball,But he couldn’t, no, he couldn’t ‘deed he couldn’t;Then he thought he’d write a poem, so his fame would spread o’er all,But it wouldn’t, no it wouldn’t, ‘deed it wouldn’t.At the Ninth Block grounds one day, so I heard some fellows say,This boy he blew his “horn” to beat the band;“As a batter I’m a star, I can beat them all by far,As for pitching, you should see me, I am grand.”One day he saw an UMPIRE, “A poet I’ll be,” he cried,“I’ll write a little poem that’s a scream;”He used four pads of paper, which goes to show he tried,The net result --a poem, called “A Dream.”This dear little boy, who though he could play ball,But found that he couldn’t, ‘deed he couldn’t, Should quit writing poems, or he’ll have no fame at all,No he wouldn’t, ‘deed he couldn’t and he shouldn’t.--Bingles
