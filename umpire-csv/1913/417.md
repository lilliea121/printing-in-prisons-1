WHO’S WHO In MacKentieville    Who chases around the livelong day, looking for work, but, praying for play? Who’s like the Dutchman’s proverbial flea, who’s never found, where he ought to be? Who's little tootsies seem never to flag, to give him time to “‘chew the rag?”’ Who’s got the Warden skinned a mile, when it comes to giving the “‘joshing’’ smile? Who’s heart’s as big, as his body’s slim? Why that clerkly gent, that little Tim.
