<h1>Trend is Toward Road Building With Pay For Convicts</h1>

<img width="200" src="/assets/img/" />
<p>TREND IS TOWARD ROAD BUILDING WITH PAY FOR CONVICTS. Governor Hanna. of North Dakota, Governor Cox, of Ohio, and Governor West, of Oregon, hold that outdoor work should be a privilege to be earned by good conduct; Governor Mann, of Virginia, testifies to the efficiency of the convicts when employed on the roads and cites figures to prove the economy of such work, maintaining, however, that the present cost can be greatly reduced by placing the men on their honor and lessening the number of idle guards; while Governor McDonald, of New Mexico, and Governor Carey, of Wyoming, refer to the few attempts at escape that have been made by convicts practically unguarded. Governor Hunt, of Arizona, is in favor of paying the convicts at least 25 cents a day for their services, as the cost will be small compared to the actual benefit derived by the construction of splendid highways, while the benefit accruing to society will return the investment a thousand fold. The consideration given to convict road work by the Governors is an indication of the importance attached to the matter by the people throughout the country. The Governors present many different viewpoints, but a careful study of their statements shows that road work, when conducted on a basis fair to the convict and the State, will go far toward solving both the convict and labor problem and the problem of good roads.</p>
