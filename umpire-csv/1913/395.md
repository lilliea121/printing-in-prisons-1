WITH THE POETS SHOW YOUR SAND    When your down and out—disheartened— ‘Till your spirits all hang loose, Don’t stop to ask the question Of yourself, ‘‘Oh, what’s the use?”’ You remember that we want you In your place on this old sphere; That we know you as our brother ‘Though we may not say it here. It may—to you—seem useless, More than your poor soul can stand, ~ But brave it out my heartie— Show the world you’ve got some sand. Never quit—God hates a quitter— There are thousands— sad—discouraged— Just because they lacked the sand Come now—do your part to show them How you’ve learned to fight and stand, For the world deserts a quitter, And backs up the man with sand. —Selected
