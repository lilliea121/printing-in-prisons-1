THE STOCKING MAKERS    Just think of all the work that’s done, On Blocks numbers eight and nine, The eleventh too is going some, And the fourth comes next in line. The socks are coming thick and fast, There’s never a minute lost, And when the month has quickly past, Your accounts are upward tossed. There are knitters and loopers upon the eighth Who wouldn’t move for aught. And in their Guards, have greatest faith, Their good-will can’t be bought. But if you do your work O. K. Your needs are well supplied, And there is time for you to play, No matter on which side. The same applies to other blocks, Where socks are daily made, It’s better boys than breaking rocks, Where no-bod-ee gets paid, You find the time goes quickly by, The exercise is great, You need never be, a dollar shy,— You're always up-to-date. —Jingles
