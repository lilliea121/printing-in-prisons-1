WITH THE POETS    THE DOGS OF CHERRY HILL    Oh, fear the dogs of Cherry Hill,    The dogs that prowl at night.    With their froth-flecked jowls,    Their blood-red eyes,    And fangs all agleaming white.    With their long lean frames,    And cat-like tread,    They stalk the grounds    Like ghouls amid the dead.    Oh, fear the dogs of Cherry Hill,    The dogs that prowl at night.    Whose days are spent within an iron cage    And their slum’brous dreams are all of rage,    And of a passion to rend and  bite.    For centuries known as man’s true friend,    Yet by Man trained now, to all men hate;    They are denied all love of human kind—    Shunned, and curs’t for their man-made fate.    Oh pity the dogs of Cherry Hill,    The dogs that prowl at night.    Whose instincts true are dwarf't and bent    To the will of Man, in his eager intent    To make all things his in the contest for Might.    Condemned to be caged the long days through,    The better to man-hunt in the gloom,    Their lives roll on, without a rent    In the blackness that surrounds their doom. —Mitch.
