CUBS 3 BAND 0    July 1    Today, for the third time, the Band and Cubs met to decide the winner of the twice-tied game of June 23. Owing to a delay in starting, only two full innings were played, the Cubs, being the victors, score 3-0. Ban, for the Musicians, was very wild and only good fielding on the part of his associates prevented the Cubs from adding to the agony. Herb, on the contrary, working in the box for the Cubs, was very steady, and struck out four of the six men, who came up before him. The real feature of the event, was a brilliant catch of a vicious drive by Timmy, who was seated in the grand stand, acting as an official bodyguard to three young lady visitors. When the Poet’s dollar-and-a-quarter ball came hurling toward them with the velocity of a shell from a6 inch rapid-fire gun, Timmy, as became a true and valorous knight, interposed the whole of his 120 lbs. between the ladies and the coming danger, deftly caught the messenger of death at the critical moment, and hurled it back with disdainful sangfroid, while the crowd applauded his heroism, and wanted him to do it over again. There was no response to the encore. — Mitch.
