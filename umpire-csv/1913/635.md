Unto Others    A SONG of those within the desert places— The dull, the strange, the erring of all lands, Who face the future with despairing faces, And stretch forth pleading, unavailing hands. The heirs of poverty, the slaves of weakness, The arrogant who will not heed commands; The spiritless who wear a coward’s meekness, The desperate who spill life's creeping sands. Oh! holders of the prized and vantage places, Oh! holders of the peaceful, happy days, Oh! scions of the wise and favored races, Oh! revelers along the sunny ways— I beg a moment's pause, with earnest faces, That common blood and Fatherhood demands; A prayer for those within dreary places Who stretch forth pleading, unavailing hands. —Collier's
