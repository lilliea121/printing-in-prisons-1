THE Umpire has made two resolutions for the coming year.    One is to continue to give the best of which it is capable, and the other is to abolish the Poet’s column.    The Poet’s column has been a most prolific source of evil for many months and the temptation of its existence is to be swept away, and placed to the credit of “reform within the party.” It has been the cause of more cases of grand larceny than any other one thing in the institution, not excepting the ginger cake closet. The nerve with which a majority of the contributors to this paper pilfer the verses of some of our best known writers, sign their numbers to them and then send them to the Editor as their “truly own,” is sufficient to insure them instant success in the burglary line, if they ever desire to take up that heroic profession. There is no doubt but that the members of the Parole Board recognize the true source of these verses, which we have published from time to time, as a sop to the culprits vanity, and naturally they must conclude that a man who, even in prison cannot curb his propensity to steal, though it be but a few verses, is scarcely one to be trusted outside the walls. It is partly to save these men from the judgment of the Inspectors on this account that we are withdrawing the temptation. But remember, if you have the “real thing,” in verse or prose, and it is all your own, send it in—we want it, and want it bad.
