Stocking Shed vs. Library      On April 8, under a clear sky with the atmosphere a little chilly, the Library   journeyed to the Stable Grounds to meet the Stocking Shed. This game marked one of the first battles of the E.S.P. League, as the opening day of the season's schedule, dated April 7, was postponed, and while I think from the large attendance that the day lay over helped ,to "incite" enthusiasm, as some of the I spectators were pleasant without their I coats, which was a, very acceptable companion under the prevailing weather conditions.   Baseball has certainly set the wheels (Continued on page four )         of eagerness 1n urn, or wherever one   goes he will meet a group of rooters or stars, discussing their views and knowledge of the National Game.   I think that before we continue further, that we should extend our gratitude of thanks to our Warden, for his kindly consideration given to this amusement, by permitting every inmate of the institution to attend the games and create an intel'est that was heretofore put to a different angle, allowing our minds to center on more pleasant inclinations. Think of the entire Eighth Block, with the Overseers, out to see rivalry in action. So fellows, keep order, and have the Â·warden feel that you appreciate this extension of liberty ; for the real fun has not commenced, and every one wants to be on the ground floor when the summer arrives to see the ball travel.   I will go back to the stable cinders for the benefit of those who where not present, and first of all; the other teams want to pay strict attention to a few words that should take root and they are: there are some good material exiting in these two teams that is worthy of attention."   When the umpire called "play ball," the fans were occupying every available perch. We will have to have a grandstand built if the crowd increases.   Jimmie, of the Library, was the first man to lead off the season with the bat, and the first ball thrown by the opposing pitcher, cut the pan in two ; but Jimmie waited and walked. Eggie followed with a sacrific<.', that brought Jimmie to third, where he died; Whitey and Louie going out on strikes.   1 3725, the first batter np for Stocking Shed, hit the first ball thrown by Yellow and was safe at first. 5293 followed   with the same dope ; 3527 going to third; he tried to steal home and was out. Duckie hit the air and quitely sat down.   The second baseman of the Shed was off in his fiekling; perhaps a little over anxious. Summary of the game below.    STOCKING SHED   A.B.
