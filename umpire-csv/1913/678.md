There is at least one man in the world with pluck enough to step out into the open, and publicly state a fact that has been known for years, but never a man with the courage to give it utterance until Judge McKenzie Cleland of Chicago electrified an audience the other night by stating that nearly everyone was a criminal. He said :    “The most misunderstood person in the world is the criminal, and he is misunderstood because of our ignorance. We commit the unpardonable blunder of putting all criminals in the same class.”    “Nearly every person nowadays is a criminal because it is virtually impossible to live without violating one or more innumerable laws. The criminals we despise and condemn are merely those who have been caught and convicted.” “The first duty of the Church is to become acquainted with our penal system, and its second duty is to demand that this system be modernized and made practical and effective.”    The Judge is not only a man of courage, but a diplomat of high order. Note the remark: “nearly every person.” thing needful to keep up personal esteem, for it allows everyone to say to himself, “he means the other fellow, I’m one of the elect.”
