BAND vs LIBRARY    In the above contest, which bid fair to be listless, until the game was half finished, then the teams began to get a move on. With the exception of a run being scored in the second inning, nothing of any note transpired, until the bunching of a quantity of runs by the Band in the fourth inning. It was follows :—Josh passed to 1st, stole 2nd and 3rd, and with Ban J, who also passed, dashed home on Reddy’s hit; who later stole 2nd and 3rd, and stole home cleverly. Owens walked, and eventually scored on the Poet’s bunt. In the 7th inning Josh scored on Louis’ sacrifice. Charlie was on the mound for the Library, but we think he is taking chances. There is no doubt his arm is not right, and we advise a longer rest. Louis pitched a good game for the Band and ‘kept his opponents down to one run. ! To do justice to Yeap, we declare that he played the whole game. Double plays were smartly performed, by Yeap, Josh and Louis. Score 5—1. as — Henry.
