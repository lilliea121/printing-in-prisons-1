<p>NINTH vs PLASTERERS April 23 The Ninth met the Plasterers for the second time this year, and the result was reversed; the Ninth bringing home the bacon by the score of 7-1. Longie started the game, and was going fine, but was relieved by Bill in the fourth, who held the Plasterers scoreless. Curly, as usual, was on the firing line for the “Mud Slingers,’’ bat was not very effective. Rube is still stinging the ball, having a home run and a two bagger. ‘This makes four home runs in three games —Mr. Baker, take notice. The umpires should stop Dave from stepping in front of the ball. We do not mind him getting his base so much, but we are afraid he will be out of the game through injuries, and that would be far worse a blow to the Plasterers, than the blow he received on his arm. After the Plasterers went out in order in their first half, the Ninth got to Curly from the start. Lefty waited for four wide ones, and Rube followed with a home run over the roof. Stump dropped Cap’s fly, but Cap, was doubled up, when Slick, by poor head work hit at the first ball over. Fatty making a nice catch, doubling up Cap. at first. Longie is surprising everyone by his hitting this year. He came through with a home run this game. The Plasterers were very weak with the stick, not getting a ball beyond second base. Dave played his usual good game, likewise Curly, who fielded his position good, taking everything that came his way. Dave’s “WHITE HOPE” was seen warming up around by the burner, but for some reason, best known to himself, must have been very chilly, as he was still there when the whistle blew. —Timmy</p>
