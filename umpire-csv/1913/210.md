It is a pleasure to note that while the games of the past week were mostly of an exciting nature and vigorously contested, there was an entire absence of anything pertaining to ‘‘rowdyism,”’ or individual animosity. Stalling is still in vogue to some extent, and reprehensible only an account of the limitation of time. While every praise is deserved by the three leaders in the race, the Band is also deserving credit by reason of the invariable good nature of its members, and the cheerful alacrity with which they come forward for defeat.       It is with deep regret that the UMPIRE announces the resignation of “Rocky” from its staff of regular contributors. He states, that it is his intention to devote all of his spare time in the future to the writing of a play, and as we have no desire to encroach upon time, to be so valuably employed, we have accepted his resignation. Vale “Rocky!”       A great deal of interesting matter has been crowded out of this issue to make room for the unusually large number of baseball reports.
