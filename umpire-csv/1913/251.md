LIBRARY WINS    June 14    The Library and Plasterers played off last Wednesday’s tie this afternoon, and the latter went down to defeat. In the first inning the Plasterites got three on bases but failed to score, Yellow pitching in wonderful form. The Library sewed up the game in a sack in the first inning, and after that was never in any danger. Jim laid down a pretty bunt, Mike hit for 2 bases, Ban walked, Eggie and Beef hit safe, and this resulted in a quartet of runs. The Library scored two more runs in the sixth on a vicious drive by Beef for three bases, a hit by Eggie and Chick, and an error by Aleck. The Plasterers two runs came in the 5th. Base on balls to Harry; Tony’s 2 base hit, and the Barber’s clout for two sacks resulted in two runs, ones they were able to get. The feature of the game was a catch made by Ban, short fielder of the Library, when he jumped 5 feet up the side of the wall and grabbed a liner with one hand. Eggie played good ball at 3rd, accepting 12 chances without an error. Mike, Ban and Beef Trust, distinguished themselves with their stick work. Curly was hit freely and had very poor support. Umpires, Neal and John Henry.    -Jingles
