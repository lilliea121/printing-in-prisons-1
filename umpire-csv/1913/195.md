KINDNESS IN OUR HIDDEN CITY Is kindness within these Gray Stone Walls, Where we boy’s land after a serious fall ? Of course there is; and I know it’s true That kindness will pull the worst one through, Take Pals, that lock in a room alone, Some of them scrap but soon atone, Just a cheerful word, a nice kind smile— Then they’re pals again for quite awhile. Kindness is great in a place like this, And it’s something boys you'll never miss, A nice kind word to a pal that’s blue How it shortens the day and helps him thro’. And don’t forget the lifetime men Show them a kindness whene’er you can. Live in the present, and forget the past Improve the future, let this be ‘‘your last.” — Spider.
