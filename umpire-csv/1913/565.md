JEWISH NEW YEAR IN PRISON    Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year (5674) was appropriately observed by the Jewish inmates of the institution. Regular services were held in the unoccupied Emergency Hospital. B6676 who possesses a pure tenor voice, acted as Cantor and reader. He led the services, and was assisted by a trained choir. The Warden who always takes a deep interest in religious affairs, came in and the Cantor, and choir sang a beautiful Hebrew prayer. In return, the Warden gave a heart-to-heart talk. He related the story of Daniel, and prophesied that some day, another Daniel would come out of the wilderness, appointed by the Lord, and take a stand for His people and lead them back to the right way so that they may once more be God’s chosen people in every sense of the word. —B 6076.
