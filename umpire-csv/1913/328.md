SAID TO BE FUNNY    Let us be thankful for occasional visits from the man who sees the funny side of things.    In the Schoolroom—    Mr. Bonsall:—Sammy, if your father borrowed $50 and agreed to pay it back at the rate of $5 a month, how long would it take him to pay?    Sammy:—(confidently) It’d take him all his life, and den some more.    Mr. Bonsall:—Beat it back to your cell, quick. You're the limit.    Sammy:—(sadly) Ah, Teechur, you don’ know my fadder. —B 62950.       Some Summer Don’ts observed in MacKentieville :    Don’t mix your drinks.    Don’t drink liquor after eating.    Don’t drink liquor before eating.    Don’t eat meat and drink milk at the same meal.    Don’t hurt anybody’s feelings; they might hurt back.       Mrs. Talkington—Tell me the truth, Henry, have I a rival?    Mr. Talkington—Only the phonograph, my love.
