BASEBALL FOR CONVICTS At the meeting of the Warden’s Association held in Indianapolis, last week, in connection with the annual meeting of the American Prison Association, recreations for prisoners was the main topic, and baseball recommended as one of the best forms of recreations for imprisoned men. O. S. Lewis, of the New York Prison association, said: ” It brings convicts into better relations with the officials, and improves the health and minds of the prisoners. Not fifteen years ago, it was regarded almost as a high crime to smile in prison, but now, shouts and cheers of the prisoners at a ball game are common occurrences in many prisons, Warden Johnston, of the California Reformatory, praised the introduction of baseball in the prisons, and said exhibitions of moving pictures had also been found helpful in his institution. In this connection it is pleasant to note that ‘‘Old Timers” of the baseball diamond attending the annual meeting of the National Association of Professional Baseball League, in Columbus, Ohio, on November 11, will play a game with the convicts in the Ohio Penitentiary on November 15, according to the present program. The Game will be played on the baseball diamond inside the prison walls, and will be one of the first games on record between penitentiary prisoners and regular professional baseball players connected with the big Leagues. Our character is our will, for what we will, we are.
