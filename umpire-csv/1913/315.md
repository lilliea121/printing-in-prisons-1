Band 3 Shed 2   July 3   Despite several doubtful decisions by the two umpires, the Band got away with its game with the Shed, today by the score 8-2. Neither Ducky or Ban, the opposing moundsmen got down to real work until the third inning, at which time the game was won and lost; there being no other tallies throughout the remainder of the session. As they stand at present, these teams are almost evenly matched, and any series in which they take part together should prove interesting, even if they do lack brilliancy. -â€”Mitch.
