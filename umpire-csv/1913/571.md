PERPETUAL SABBATH    A perpetual Sabbath is celebrated on earth. This is not generally known, for most people think that the day called Sunday, is the only one celebrated. The Greeks observe Monday, the Persians, Tuesday, the Assyrians, Wednesday, the Egyptians, Thursday, the Turks, Friday, the Hebrew and several Christian sects, Saturday, and the Christians, Sunday. So really it is Sabbath every day to some one on earth. —American Practitioner      Now they want “Father’s Day.”
