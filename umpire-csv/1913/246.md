NINTH BEATS BAND    June 13.    While the Band was beaten by the Ninth this afternoon by the decisive score of 11-8, they put up the best game of ball they have played for many days. They put Big Louie in the box, and he did much better than was expected, though he was hit in lively shape in the third and sixth inning; Cap, Yeap and Lefty knocking out home runs. Oddie, anew man on the Band, plays earnest and effective ball, but, he needs coaching in the rules and finer points of â€” Mitch. the game.
