DOUBLY PERFECT    It you will allow me to advise, ’Tis time we ceased to criticize, The maid who flaunts before our eyes, A skirt that’s widely cleft. Perhaps she is an awful sight, But if we truly are polite, We'll say she has a perfect right, Likewise a perfect left. —B 6290       Sadie had a little man, His given name was “Blink,” And every night when he came home, He was full of Printer’s Ink. Sadie tired of scrubbing “Blink”’ And sent him to the Pen. And now every time that he comes out She sends him back again.
