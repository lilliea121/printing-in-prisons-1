A Few Pointers      It is easy to believe that which we wish or hope for earnestly, and we discard easily that which would cause us pain.      A mirror in which we see vice in all its hideousness, and virtue in all its beauty, is teaching us to despise the one, and to adore and emulate.      The success or failure of a man engaged in manufacturing transportation, or in agriculture, depends more upon his skill as a prophet, than it does as an industry.
