<p>PLASTERERS vs LIBRARYJuly 14 The Jingle Bells went down to defeat today in a well played game, that was not marred by an argument of any kind The game was snappy, with good hitting and sharp fielding on both sides. For the Plasterers, Jim and Felix scored on Curly’s triple and in the 2nd Ban and 6103 came in for the Library. In the same inning Yaller made a clean home-run, and Harry and Stump also each added a tally to the Plasterers score. Timmy and Stump led the batting for their respective teams; the former scoring a home-run in the fourth, and the latter making two and three-baggers throughout the game, and scoring two of the 4 runs made by the Library. In the 6th, the Plasterers had everything their own way, Curly making a homer; Harry a triple and Jack a single, each scoring on Yellow’s hit. Ban and Yaller each pitched good ball, the former having seven strikeouts and the latter eleven to his credit. Final score, Plasterers 9, Library 3. Umpire Mack. — Bill</p>
