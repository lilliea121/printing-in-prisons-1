WITH THE POETS    A SONG    There are songs enough for the hero    Who dwells on the heights of fame;    I sing for the disappointed—    For those who have missed their aim.    I sing with a tearful cadence    For the one who stands in the dark,    And knows that his last, best arrow,    Has bounded back from the mark.    I sing for the breathless runner, The eager, anxious soul,    Who falls with his strength exhausted,    Almost in sight of the goal.    For the heart that breaks in silence,    With a sorrow all unknown,    For those who need companions,    Yet walk their ways alone.    There are songs enough for the lovers,    Who share love's tender pain;    I sing for the one whose passion,    Is given all in vain.    For those whose spirit, comrades    Have missed them on their way,    I sing with a heart o’erflowing,    This minor strain today.    And I know the Solar System    Must somewhere keep in space,    A prize for the spent runner    Who barely lost his race.    For the plan would be imperfect,    Unless it held some sphere    That paid for the toil and talent,    And love that are wasted here. —Selected.
