PRAISE FOR “UMPIRE” WRITER    DEAR Editor:—Please give me a little space in your paper to thank B 6594 for the beautiful articles he is contributing, showing the truth to us in its full value. I hope he will impress these facts on the minds of all, that they may see beauty and virtue and learn to serve God, rather than man. B 6594, you have my prayers and best wishes for a happy and successful life. B 5074.
