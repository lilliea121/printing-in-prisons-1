WANTS THE REAL THING    Thomas Mott Osborne, chairman of the New York State Prison Reform Commission, appointed to investigate and suggest prison reform legislation, began a self-imposed term in Auburn prison on September 30. Mr. Osborne outlined his purpose to the convicts, and while conceding that there are many shortcomings in such an experiment, justifies his purpose in the following statement: “T have the feeling that after I have really lived among you, marched in your lines, shared your food, gone to the same stone cells at night, and in the morning looked at God’s sunlight through those same iron bars, that then, and not until then, can I feel the knowledge which will break down the barriers between my soul and the souls of my brothers.”
