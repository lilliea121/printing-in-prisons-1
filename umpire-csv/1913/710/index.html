<h1>A Christmas Dinner In Cherry Hill, A.D. 1950</h1>

<p>A CHRISTMAS DINNER In Cherry Hill, A. D. 1950 AS the restless tiger incessantly paces his iron cage sensing the approach of the keeper with his daily allowance of raw meat, so the men of Cherry Hill restlessly walked the floor of their cells, eagerly listening for sounds heralding the approach of their annual Christmas banquet. A single clap of hands, and then the silence of the immense blocks and galleries was broken with the scurrying feet of Overseers and runners. An instant later the clash of iron against iron, as the heavy keys were thrust into locks, crashed against the ear, and the monotonous sound of opening door after door, indicated that the hour had approached. As the bell in the tower tolled “one” there was another clap of hands, and men began to dart from the doorway of their cells as prairie dogs from their burrows. Standing each in front of his own door, erect, but alert, they formed along thin blue line waiting for the word of command, as soldiers in open formation. Those standing on the galleries looking upon the blocks below, saw long tables covered with snowy Cloths stretching one-third the distance down the corridor, on each side of which camp chairs had been placed. Beginning at the extreme end, and at distances of about five feet, were gorgeous! bunches of white, crisp celery, topped with their own beautiful varying shades of green. Between these, were glass stands filled with the deep rich red of the native cranberry, and between these again were large baskets of fruit, oranges, bananas, figs, and malaga grapes. Flanking these toothsome dainties were large platters of candied sweet potatoes, and near by, huge vegetable dishes overflowing with whipped white potatoes. Japanese nut boats, filled with assorted nuts, candies and raisins, also found a place on the generous table, while in the center, was a tall Christmas tree, its lower branches cut away to avoid obstructing the view, and suspended from its boughs, were many bundles of little cigars, tied up with narrow strips of holly colored ribbon. This was the scene on every block, for the arrangement of each was identical. And everywhere and over all, were long streamers of evergreen, holly and mistletoe, with Larry Redmond’s rubber plants occupying places of honor. The Orchestra and Band were on the Center, and at a signal from Prof. Wiegandt the inspiring sounds of “The Washington Post March” burst upon the ear, and the long blue lines extending from the “rim of the wheel,” began to move with measured steps along the “spokes” toward the “hub.” As they reached the neck of each block, the march was continued between the aisles formed by the tables, until the first man reached the last place; then they all turned, (CONTINUED ON PAGE 4)A CHRISTMAS DINNER (CONTINUED FROM PAGE 1) and in a moment were seated. On the plate before him, each man found a paper napkin enfolding two luncheon rolls, tied with red, white and blue ribbon. While they were yet inspecting these novelties, a movement was noticed on the Center and the entire Board of Inspectors passed along. As they paused for a moment, the Warden was noticed to give a few directions, and the Inspectors separated, each to take a place at the head of one of the tables. The Chaplain also presided over one of the tables, while the Deputy and his assistant took positions at others, The Warden, resplendent in blue and gold, directed all the movements from his position alongside of the big bass drum. Brother Bill, wearing a new baseball uniform and carrying one of Frank Baker’s black homerun bats, was stationed at the “neck” to preserve order. Another pause, and then to the air of “Alexander’s Rag Time Band,” a procession of white-coated and white-aproned men, recruited mostly from the First block, came into view carrying long trays of smoking hot portions of that noble bird of pray, the American turkey. Two men were required for each tray, and by its side walked two others with polished knives and forks. Their duties were soon made known. “Preacher” gave one of his characteristic whoops, and shouted: “Come a-runnin’ boys, come a-runnin’. Pass her up quick, no time fur foolin’.. What? White meat? Kyant han’le yer. Dark meat fur de whites, and white meat fur de blacks; dem’s de ordahs. No suh, kyant han’le yer.” And so they went all the way down the long tables until every man was served with a huge portion. Everything was going along as merry as a wedding in little Italy. The men had no time for talk, and the quickest eaters received the most turkey, for there were the Preacher, George Henry, Ban J., Honus, Slim, Shine, Jore, Big Jack and a score of others in constant attendance, and all doing their best to satisfy the unappeasable appetites. As the time passed away, along with the turkey and other good things, except the warden, a further movement was noticed in the direction of the truck station, and again waiters appeared this time carrying baskets of something in bottles. There was a hasty emptying of glasses in anticipation of a “fitting climax” and then the corks began to pop. My how it sparkled and foamed ! Hopes were quickly dashed however, for the first man to taste it, gasped out between his choking, “it’s Soda!’ At the same time it was very good soda and sparkled like the real thing. The soda being disposed of waiters stepped forward and began to shake the Christmas trees, and from their boughs came the bunches of little cigars which were seized upon and lighted in a “jiffy.” The Band all the while striving its utmost to make more noise than the Orchestra so that between the two there was enough sound to satisfy a political convention, and then have some left over for the New Year’s Shooters. But as the Warden raised his hand, the music ceased, and he stepped forward evidently in preparation for a speech. In a moment there was a tense silence; and then he said : “My men, I hope you have all had a good time. We have selected those things it was thought you would like best, and you may have noticed that there were no mince pies, or plum pudding. However I am going to give you your dessert now, and I know everyone of you will agree that nothing better could be given to top off your excellent dinner than the piece of news I am about to communicate.” (Cries of “Hurrah! Let’s have it! Hurry it along!”) “Very well, you shall have it. I hold in my hand a communication from the Governor, in which he states that it his purpose to PAROLE EVERY ONE OF YOU MEN just as soon— “BANG!!!” Dang that door! Why can’t they let a fellow sleep, and make “Dad” quit yelling “ how many—Mitch?”</p>
