A FAIR DECISION    Establishing a precedent, the Directors of the National league have ordered the game between the New York and Phillies on August 30, finished on October 2 with the same men in the field, and under the same status as existed the day Umpire Brennan awarded the game to New York, on account of spectators, as he ruled, interfering with the batters. At the time the game was called there was a man on base, one man out, and a ball on the batter, with the score 8-6, in favor of the Phillies. The same situation, with the same men in the field, and at the bat is ordered to be reproduced, and the game finished.      Let Health and Wealth be incidental, and you'll have both.
