PLASTERERS vs BAND    Band Would Have Beat Plasterers, If Weather Hadn’t Been Stormy    That which had every appearance of being a very fine game, was commenced today between the above teams, and brought to a premature finish by an angry thunderstorm, which at the same time, for many reasons was most welcome. Both teams were in real earnest, and bent on gaining the victory, but the Plasterers won by the slender margin of one run. The Bandsmen were playing with much vigor, and but for the elements, most probably would have been returned the winners. Alec, Felix, and Frank, each scored a run, and we especially noticed the very smart playing of the latter, both in the field and at the bat. Hitherto all of our prognostications have materialized, and in this case, before the season is finished, this young Trojan, in company with some others, will be found in the van. Harry was on the bench today; for what reason we are not informed, but nevertheless we do not commend Dave, for changing his line up at such a critical moment. Six and the Poet scored for the Band, and the whole team seems now to be playing like one man. As the rain came down, the game was being most fiercely contested, but it had speedily to be abandoned. Result 3—2 in favor of the Plasterers.
