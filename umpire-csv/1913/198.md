CONCERT BY BOYS’ CHOIR    More than fifty little boys from the choir of St. John’s Boys’ Orphan Asylum of this city, came all the way from 48th and Wyalusing avenue, to take part in the Sacred concert given here on Sunday afternoon under the auspices of the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners. The program, embracing many classics, was of unusual merit, and the numbers effectively rendered by the boys, in their clear, sweet soprano voices, reflected the able manner in which they had been trained by their master, Prof. A. H. Heuermann. Messrs Edward Donohue, A. Huver, Francis Diamond and W. Kristel, were the soloists, and their splendid efforts were fully appreciated. Melody reaches its height of grandeur in the cultivated adult voice, but, can never arouse the same tender thoughts as that inspired by the blended harmony of the pure sweet tones of unsullied children. The men are deeply grateful for the entertainment, so thoughtfully prepared, and so ably executed.
