WHO’S WHO In MacKentieville    Who pounds the dough to make the bread, upon which we are so plentifully fed? Who guards our health to such an extent, that never a hot loaf to us is sent, to give us cramps, and disturb our sleep, “when shades of darkness over us creep?” Who uses his skill in an effort ‘to make, the large and toothsome ginger cake? Who pitches a ball like a hunk of dough? Why that bakeshop gent, that Tony you know.
