In the following bits of verse there is concealed the names of 16 cities of the United States See how many of these cities you can find. For instance in the first line;    “I had a little rocking chair,” the city is Little Rock. Find the others and also name the States they are in.    I had a little rocking chair,    Placed on a high oak landing,    So that my little son Jack may see,    The bathing very handy.    Hanna, Polish girl, his maid.    Says he is bold enough,    Not all himself she often says,    To hand over his sweetest puff.    Once Hanna saved my little Jack,    From a lion’s den very cheap,    She will get a new bed for doing that,    And a vacation away for ten weeks,    Now little Jack can’t run nor walk,    He’ll have an automobile or bust,    So I will not try to dodge for that,    Will be all set in August. —B 6475.
