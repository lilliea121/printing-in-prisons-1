REFERRING TO THE Kansas State Penitentiary at Lansing, and its weekly publication, the Abilene Reflector says : Here’s something with which the newspapermen may soothe their souls: In the state penitentiary are about 875 prisoners. The institution publishes a little weekly paper called ‘The Penitentiary Bulletin.” In most states the prison paper is edited by the prisoners, but in the Kansas institution this is impossible because there is not an editor in the entire list. Consequently the chaplain is compelled to add the duties of editor to his other tasks. Is there another state in the union where the editors are such model citizens? It is humbly suggested without “malice aforethought” that perhaps the dearth of editorial material in the Kansas institution, may be due to police dereliction, rather than to the high state of morality of Western newspaper men. The Editor of the Umpire enjoys the distinction of being the only one of this class, in a population of nearly 1500, but it is well known, there are several more at least, who should be giving this institution the benefit of their splendid talents.
