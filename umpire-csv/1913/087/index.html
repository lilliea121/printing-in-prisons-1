<h1>And They All Played Ball</h1>

<p>AND THEY ALL PLAYED BALL The game opened with Molasses at the stick, and smallpox catching. Cigar was in the box with plenty of smoke. Horn on first base, and Fiddle on second base, backed by Corn in the field, who made it hot for Umpire Apple who was rotten. Ax came to bat and chopped. Cigar let Brick walk, and Sawdust filled the bases. Song made a hit, and Twenty made a score. Cigar went out and Balloon started to pitch but went straight up. Then Cherry tried it but was wild. Old Ice kept cool in the game until he was hit by a pitched ball, then you ought to have heard ice scream. Cabbage had a good head and kept quiet: Grass covered lots of ground in the field and the crowd cheered when Spider caught the fly. Bread loafed on third and pumped Organ who played fast and put Light out. In the fifth inning Wind began to blow about what he could do. Hammer began to knock and Trees began to leave. The way they roasted Peanuts was a fright. Knife was put out for cutting first base. Lightning finished pitching the game and struck out six men. In the ninth Apple told Fiddle to take his base. Oats was shocked, then Song made another hit. Trombone made a slide, and Meat was put out on the plate. There was lots of betting on the game but Soup cleaned up. The score was 1 to 0. Door said if he had pitched he would have shut them out.</p>
