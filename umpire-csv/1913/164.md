WHY PEOPLE SHOULD OWN AND READ BOOKS I regard books in my library in much the same way that a sea captain regards the charts in his chartroom. It is manifestly impossible for a sea captain to carry in his head the memory of all the reefs, rocks, shoals, harbors, points, lighthouses, beacons and buoys of all the coasts of all the world; and no sea captain endeavors to store in his head such a mass of knowledge. What he does is to know his way about the chartroom, and when he picks up a new coast, he takes out the proper chart and has immediate access to all information about that coast So it should be with books. Just as the captain must have a well equipped chartroom, so the student and thinker must have a well-equipped library, and must know his way about that library. I, for one, never can have too many books; nor can my books cover too many subjects. I may never read them all, but they are always there, and I never know what strange coast I am going to pick up at any time in sailing the world of knowledge. â€”J. London
