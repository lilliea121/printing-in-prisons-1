Poet, to his wife, awakening at midnight with an inspiration.—‘‘Git up, quick, I’ve just thought of a good word.”    “Oh, go to sleep,” replied his wife petulantly, “I’ve just thought of a mighty bad word.”       The education gained in that excellent school, Experience, is one we are not likely to forget. — Cutty.
