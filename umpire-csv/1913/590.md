IN ALL THE LARGE PENAL institutions throughout the world, may be found a class of men who are natural born mechanics. This talent, whether natural, or acquired, is one that demands employment, and it seeks an outlet in many ingenious ways. The product of the skill of these men is often beautiful, and then again wonderful in its representation of the very acme of care and patience. The difficulty has always been to find a market for this product, but the warden of a Western prison has evidently solved the matter, by the introduction of a feature, which promises to be of great benefit to his men, an enjoyable novelty to the public, and of infinite credit to himself. He has arranged a ‘‘ Bazaar” in the prison, setting aside a room for the purpose, which he has caused to be decorated with flags, bunting and other suitable materials. Here, all of the novelties made by the prisoners during the year, are properly tagged, and attractively arranged on tables placed around the walls. The public is then invited to come and inspect the result of the industry and ingenuity of his men, and make purchases of any articles pleasing to their fancy. This sale will enable many of those men to send Christmas gifts to their families this year, which will be doubly prized, as coming unexpectedly, from those so unfortunately placed.
