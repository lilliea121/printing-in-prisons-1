Phillies Won in Ninth      Durham, N. C.   The Phillies won out by a hair over the Durham club of the Carolina League here today. In the 9th inning, with the score 4 to 3 in favor of DurhRim, things looked bad for the Phillies. Magee, first up, hit a long fly to left field. Kelly booted Miller's grounder, and this started things going. Dolan sacrificed him to second, and Dooin selected himself to bat for Dodge and slammed out a two bagger, which put across the tying run, and then La Longe ordered the same thing and Dooin scored on his two bagger.   "Wild Bill" Donovan, formerly of Detroit, and now manager of Providence of the International League, which is here training, umpired the game. Score 4 to 3.
