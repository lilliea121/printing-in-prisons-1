<p>LIBRARY LOSES TO CUBS The Cubs met the Librarians, their competitors for third place honors last Thursday afternoon and walloped them good and plenty by the score, 5-1. The game was uneventful, and went through in jig time, without a wrangle of any kind. Both Tommy and Yellow handed out some hot ones for their respective teams. The former being credited with eight strikeouts and the latter six. Both men had unusually good support. The Librarians opened the session by Jimmie scoring on Bans three-bagger, and that was the sum total of their runs, though in two subsequent innings they had men left at third. Yellow distinguished himself by a clever running catch of Freddie’s fly. For the Cubs, But lined out a home run in the second, but, there was nothing doing by either team in the third and fourth. In their half of the fifth however, the Cubs found the ball which netted them two runs; and again in the sixth, through opportune hits by But, and Betts, tallied two more, and copped the game. Lippy umpired the game without a protest. —Mitch.</p>
