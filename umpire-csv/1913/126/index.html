<p>The above is a sketch of Mr. Joe Morgan, attending to the numerous wants of the men on the sixth gallery. We do not know whether Mr. Morgan is satisfied with all the men on the sixth gallery, but we do know that all the men are satisfied with Mr. Morgan. He is in no way connected with the banking concern in New York. However, the late Pierpont Morgan and our Mr. Morgan had one trait in common-â€”the collecting of pictures. His private gallery is one of the largest in this city, thousands of pictures being in the collection, and he is adding to them daily.</p>
