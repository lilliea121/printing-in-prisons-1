<h1>Library vs Stocking Shed</h1>

<p>LIBRARY vs STOCKING SHED The weakness of the Stocking Shed was painfully apparent in their fielding on Wednesday with the Library. It seemed as tho they could not hold a ball, and when they did recover the ball, they did not know what to do with it. We were surprised at Fingers. A long fly came out in his territory, and he misjudged it. That was excusable; but there is no excuse for a player who takes his time in returning the ball to infield. Blink should try and get the ball away from him a little quicker. If you do not know where to throw the ball, do not hold it, but throw it to some other player who looks as if he knew what to do with it. The Shed had new a southpaw in the box and he held his own, but Eddie Plank could not have won the way the Shed fielded. Eggie pitched for the Library, and in spots was hit hard; in fact there was heavy hitting on both sides. Yellow led with the stick, getting a home run and a double. Ban put one over the Fifth Block roof for a home run also. Big Whitey hit, what for any other man would have been a home run, he just managed to reach third. Ames for the Shed loafed on his hit, and was held on second. Final score 12â€”7 favor of the Library.</p>
