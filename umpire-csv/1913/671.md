LITTLE MARY Touching lines to “little Mary’’ have been sent in by B 6055, together with a note requesting that they be published in the Umpire. We take great pleasure in complying with his request, but at the same time, wish to add a word of caution to the effect that it would be advisable for him to be careful how he permits the “spirit in his feet” to lead him around to Mary’s “chamber window sweet.” You see perhaps Miss Mills may not like it; then again perhaps her mother is a light sleeper ; and once more again, the dogs might bite him. The ”verse” follows : LITTLE MARY My Darling little Mary, I arise from dreams of Thee, In the first sweet sleep of night, When The winds are breathing low, And the stars are shining bright. And a spirit in my feet Has led me (who know how,) To thy Chamber window Sweet. —B 6055
