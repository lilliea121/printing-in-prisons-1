Connie Mack’s son, Earl, picked an All-Star team to put it over the Stetson’s of Philadelphia, last Saturday, and the latter walked away with them to the tune of 8—0. Pick another.    The Cleveland team captured the opening game of the final series with the Athletics, last Saturday by a 3—1 score.    The Phillies are keeping up their winning streak, but the rally is too late to be effective.    23,000 fans witnessed the Naps’ victory over the Athletics, on Saturday.    Washington is playing magnificent ball, and will probably pass the Naps for second place. They won five straight, in four days last week.       Success is voltage under control—keeping one hand on the transformer of your Kosmic Kilowatts.
