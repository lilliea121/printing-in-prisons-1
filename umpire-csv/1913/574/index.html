<p>ATHLETICS OWN THE EARTH WINNER OF WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP Win Four out of Five Games and Humble Arrogant Giants—Glory and Dollars for the Whole Bunch of White Elephants Bender and Plank Both in the Game. Oh, somewhere here in dear old Phil, the sun is shining bright. The Band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light. And somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere others shout— But gloom is on Manhattan, the Giants were put to rout. —Olde Ballade. It is all over; the great baseball event “of the year is but a memory, but, ah, what a sweet memory. A memory of men and doings that will recall a host of pleasurable feelings for days, and years to come. For the mighty, arrogant Giants went down to defeat so decisive, that not even a remnant of glory is attached to their side of the struggle. And with the fall of the New York National’s, another reputation was shattered, and men now wonder, how they could have ever considered the “peerless’ Mr. McGraw as the brainiest manager in the whole of baseballdom. Two years ago he overlooked Mister Franklin Baker as a factor in the game, and this year he never even considered the ‘Boy battery,” Bush and Schang as entering into the contest. were there with the goods, and Leslie Bush, a boy not yet out of his teens, and playing in his first big game, put the doughty Giants to the mat as fast as they came up before him. It was the story of David and Goliath, and of course the youthful David won out.Another matter Mr. McGraw overlooked, and that was the fact that Messrs. Bender and Plank were physically able to pitch in four of the five games played. On the quiet, no one else thought so, except Connie Mack. But the old veterans were there with the goods every time. In the second game of the series played in this city on last Wednesday, for nine grueling innings Plank held the Giants scoreless, and then with the whole team suffering from the high tension under which they had been working, he weakened, and as he did so his team mates likewise went to pieces, permitting the New Yorkers to score three runs, and the game. Pitted against him was the peerless Matty, the hero of many such struggles, and the mainstay of the Giants. He did not fail, though in the first, fourth and eight innings he was in a hole, but he crawled out, and prevented the Athletics working in a single when it meant a run. The score being 3—0 in favor of New York. On Thursday, the Athletics journeyed over to the Polo grounds, and to the surprise of the faithful White Elephant rooters, put young Leslie Bush in the box, to foil the Giants. It seemed madness to shoulder a boy with his meager experience with so much responsibility. The chances were against him, with that howling, jeering mob New York fans, shrieking insults at him. But again Connie was right, and Bush justified his confidence, for with even more decisive effect than in the first game, the Giants were crushed under a rapid fire attack by the score of 8—2. They were utterly defeated and completely humiliated in every department of the game. The Athletics swatted the ball almost every time at the bat, and there was hardly a fluke hit registered, of the twelve recorded for the victors. Tesrau, the Giants boastful pitcher, was batted clean. out of the box, after he had been touched up for 11 hits and 7 runs, when Crandall took his place, and was served the same sort of dose, and off of whom they tallied another run. Then on Friday the stage was set for this city, and Chief Bender opposed another of the Giants special twirlers, Mr. Demaree, who lasted just four innings, and was replaced by Marquard. For six innings the Giants could do nothing with the balls the big Indian was sending in, but after that with the score standing 6—0, in favor of the Athletics, Bender eased up to save his strength, and permitted the New Yorkers five runs, and then tightened up again. On Saturday, in New York, the Giants trotted out Matthewson as their savior, and while he pitched masterly ball, the Athletics found him the for three runs in the first three innings, and copped the game, pennant, the winner’s end of the boodle, the glory of the nation, and all of Philadelphia. It was a glorious victory for Eddie Plank, in that he won the game, and the Giants were only able to secure two hits off him, while the Mackmen touched up Matty for six.Collins, Baker, the Kid Schang, Barry and Oldring, in addition to the pitch-(continued on page four, third column.) Athletics own the Earth. (continued from page one.) ers, carried off the honors, though every man on the team played like a perfect part of a wonderful machine, and are entitled to an equal share of the glory. It was evident to unbiased critics, that as a team, the Giants did not compare with the Athletics. At the bat, in clearly outclassed their rivals. In the five games, the Mackmen scored 23 runs against 15 for New York. Oldring and Collins leading in the scoring with five runs each, while Merkle was the only member of the New York team to score as many as three. The Athletics secured 46 hits for a total of 63 bases, these including four doubles, four triples and two home runs. The Giants hits totaled 33, including one triple and one home run, being good for a total of 41 bases. In the five games, the Athletics batted for a team average of .271, while the Giants’ average was .202. While supporters of New York may be presenting all sorts of excuses for losing the series, the fact remains that the work of the Athletics was far superior in every way, and the world’s championship was won strictly on its merits by the best team.It is worth mentioning, that while McGraw used from 13 to 15 men in each of these struggles, Mack always finished the game with the same men with whom he started. Another record for a World’s series lies in the fact, that he used only three pitchers in the five games.From a financial point of view, the series was not so successful as in 1911, due to the rule forbidding spectators on the field, which reduced the number of admissions by about 8000 in this city.The players were only financially interested in the first four games, and the owners and Commissions failed to cut a very large melon for themselves.Following is a statement of the players shares of the first four games :  Total admissions 114,310“ Receipts $250,303.50“ for players 135,163.89Winners share (each man) 3,244.00Losers “ “ “ 2,162.00While the Athletics were batting out the final victory, last Saturday, Big Chief Bender was playing golf.</p>
