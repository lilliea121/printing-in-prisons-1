THE DOUBLE Christmas—New Year number of Good Words (Atlanta) has just been received in all its glory of eight pages, specially designed cover and illustrations, and. full of its always interesting subject matter. We can appreciate the care and labor attached to the production of such a splendid publication, which reflects credit alike upon its editorial, art and mechanical departments. It is the first number we have seen since last February, but it was worth waiting for. We are also grateful for that little pat’ on the back.
