  THE DOUBLE Christmas—New Year number of Good Words (Atlanta) has just been
  received in all its glory of eight pages, specially designed cover and
  illustrations, and. full of its always interesting subject matter. We can
  appreciate the care and labor attached to the production of such a splendid
  publication, which reflects credit alike upon its editorial, art and
  mechanical departments. It is the first number we have seen since last
  February, but it was worth waiting for. We are also grateful for that little
  pat’ on the back.
