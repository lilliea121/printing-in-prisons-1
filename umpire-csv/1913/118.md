STOCKING SHED 7, BAND 2    MAY 1    A protested game was played between the above teams. Many walked to first on account of it being May first. Tommy, pitcher, should cultivate control, as he has the goods. A little more experience, and a required knack of mixing them up, will put you in the top class, your home run was a beauty. Josh engineered a neat double play singled handed. Stocking Shed hit hard and timely. Two Band pitchers knocked out, and the third groggy. The game was replete with sins of commission and omission. Infusion of new blood will help the Bandits. A running catch of a fly was made by some player, whose name I didn’t catch —although he caught the ball. —Rocky       Library. v0 0 4 0 3—7 IBA RUM cc le ccateemanr eee 0101 0—2
