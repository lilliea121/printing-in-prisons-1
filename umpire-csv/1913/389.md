CUBS vs. LIBRARY    A great disappointment was experienced at the game between the Cubs and Library Monday, who on paper seem to be pretty evenly matched. Tommy and Charlie dominated the mound. ‘They issued several free passes, and both of them have pitched better ball. Herb scored in the first inning, Tommy and Mike in the second, when Charlie walked five men. Tommy and Mike scored again in the third, on Herb’s double, and Butt made another. Timmy poled on Woody’s hit. The Library were unfortunate throughout the whole game. They had plenty of men on bases, but were unable to score. Slip, their new acquisition, exploited himself at first base, and handled the club with dexterity. He reached third once, and was caught stealing third on another occasion. Up to the last inning they had not scored a run, and everything pointed to a shutout, when Beef Trust stole third splendidly, and scored on Josh’s high fly, which he unfortunately overestimated. Jor hit a double and scored on Joe’s single, who, by the way, made two fine infield fly catches. He was caught stealing third, and to settle the climax, Josh, running for Tommy, stole second and third, and with masterly dash, stole home. Result 7—3 in favor of Cubs. Umpire, John Henry. — Henry.
