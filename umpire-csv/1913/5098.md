SANATORIUMS FOR CRIMINALS    Inebriates who neglect and mistreat their families are treated as patients requiring medical care, rather than as a criminal, in Wayne county, Michigan. Judge Lacy, of the new Court of domestic relations, says: ‘“There is only one way to make the husband, who is able-bodied and in full possession of his faculties support his wife and family, and that is to send him to jail. It is useless, however, to send an inebriate to jail; what he needs is the attention of a physician, not a jailer. The jail system is inadequate; the time is coming when even those who commit crimes, will be treated in a more enlightened manner. Many of them will be sent to sanatoriums.”
