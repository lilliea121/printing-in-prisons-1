Holy Night    SILENT night! Holy night!    All things sleep save the bright    And most holy adorable pair.    Holy Child, with ringletted hair,    Sleep in heavenly peace,    Sleep in heavenly peace.    Silent night! Holy night!    Son of God, Ah! how bright    Smiles Thy love on heavenly lips! '   Tis the first Salvation Morn!    Christ, the Saviour is born!    Christ, the Saviour, is born!    Franz Gruber
