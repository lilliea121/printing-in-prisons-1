Can You Solve It?The following puzzle in figures has been given out during the week. It's about two crowds of ten men who walked into a cafe, each buying a round of five cent drinks, as per the sample. The example is six men buying a round each at the single cost of thirty cents per round, or $1.80 in all, while four purchase for themselves at cost per round of twenty cents, or eighty cents in all, making a total of $2.60. The other ten divided equally, five buying five rounds at twenty five each, or $1.25 in all, making the gross on their double purchases $2.50. It works out in figures like this.6 X 5--30 X 6 4X 5--20X 45 X 5--25 X 5 5 X 5--25 X 5The mathematicianswhy two sets of ten men by buying ten rounds of drinks for each party at a uniform price of five cents per drink should show a difference of ten cents in the totals.$1.80 $.80$1.25 $'1.25$2.60$2.50want to know
