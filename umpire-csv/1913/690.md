DEFIES WINDOW SMASHERS    A new bulletproof glass has been invented which will defy all the efforts of the militants to break a single pane. Proof of this lies in the fact that the new glass was tested at the Criterion restaurant the other night , and amid much fun every effort to break the windows proved a failure. The new window is a combination of glucose glass and xylonite welded together under enormous pressure. The burglarâ€™s diamond cannot penetrate it any more than the stones of the suffragette.
