<h1>Ninth and Shed Tie</h1>

<p>NINTH AND SHED TIE A baseball game is never lost until it is won. This fact was never more racily demonstrated than in today’s game between the Ninth and the Stocking Shed. With the clouds hanging low, and a storm threatening, at 4:50 p.m., the game was apparently safe in the keeping of the star team, by the score 6—2. However, to the surprise of everybody, through endless errors on the part of the Ninth, the Ducklings were enabled to score four additional runs, and turn a most apparent defeat, into a tie. Blink caught Cap’s outfield fly when Lefty was on third, and thereby prevented a sure brace of runs. Rube scored on a passed ball, and Eggie and Aleck scored on wild throws. Chef, Bobbie and Lefty scored in the fifth. For the Shed, Spetz scored on an error in the first, and in the third, an opportunity to win the game was lost through want of proper judgment. In the fourth, Spetz was put out at the plate through Rabbi’s scandalous coaching, which lured the little man to attempt the ridiculous. Frankie tallied on an overthrow, and John (twice) and Rabbi were caught stealing home. At this stage, the score was 6—2 in favor of the Ninth, and at the last moment, Fingers, Rabbi, Spetz and another, with the assistance of a host of errors, scored, and tied the game. — Henry.</p>
