<h2>“Bob”&quot;We all, have heard of &quot;Square Deal Bob&quot;, Who never rests, always on the job.From morn till night he's in the place, With a cheery smile upon his face.The &quot;boys&quot; may come, and the &quot;boys&quot; may go,But &quot;Bob&quot; is here, to run the show. And you can bet, he knows the way,To mix our work with a little play.Now spring is here, and fun will start The kind that touches each man's heart.The great American Game we'll see. Thanks to 'Bob&quot; J. Mc -Ken-ty.It's not for me, to sing his praise, For we all know his kindly ways.Poor life 'twould be, without our &quot;Bob.·, Those are the thoughts of all our mob.If when we're sick, or feeling blue, Whom do we tell our troubles too?A kind reply, a helping hand,Bob gives to all, of his convict band.So when we're gone, and far away,Don't let your minds to evil stray,But think of &quot;Bob&quot;, whose words are wise. That victory comes, to he who tries.Jingles</h2>
