BAND SLAUGHTERED    The Poet and Tie Team Were Helpless in the Hands of the Ninth In our opinion, only those games, where either team has a possible chance of winning, are worth recording; to wit, the game on Friday last between the Stocking Shed and the Ninth Block. In today’s game, earthly chance. With all due respect to the Band and their pitchers who did their level best to combat their opponents, but without avail, we feel bound to assert that unless they can dig up some strong twirler, their prospects will be absolutely hopeless when they come in contact with the premier teams. Today’s game was merely practice for the Ninth, and it would not be paying them much of a compliment to record the individual plays. Suffice it to say, Longy made 3 home runs, in two of which he brought in 6 runs. The Ninth used their most formidable battery, which was unnecessary, and which should be enough to account for the result—which was 21—1 in their favor. It seemed to us that nearly everybody made a home run, and the diamond gave us the impression of being on a running racetrack. one side had no Ninth: Block
