LIBRARY vs NINTH    June 27    The game between the above teams was unavoidably delayed until 4.15, but, at that hour it started with such a vim that seven innings were played: within the ensuing three-quarter hours. Yeap made his first appearance with the Librarians pitching against his old teammates, and held them down to four runs. The Ninth was too strong however, for the Jingle bells and though both clubs played splendid ball, the Library only succeeded in bringing one man across the plate. Score 4—1, Mack, the professional umpire dispensed exact justice to both teams and his associate, John Henry looked after the bases. — Bill.
