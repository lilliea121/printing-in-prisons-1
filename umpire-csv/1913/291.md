CUBS—BAND AGAIN TIED    June 26    The Cubs and Band came together again this afternoon in an effort to play off the tie game of June 23, and for five fast and furious innings the battle waged, with the honors still even, when the man in the boiler house, blew ‘“‘time,’’ and the score 5—5. It was a beautiful game throughout. Tommy and Jore of the Cubs battled against Band and Walt of the Band, and neither battery showed any advantage over the other. New England umpired from behind the bat, and John Henry was on the bases. The former gave the fans a taste of the real thing in umpiring, and was at all times the master of the game. Ban was very wild, and had it not been for his good support, and Tommy being almost equally as wild, there might have been a decisive contest. After the second inning however, when the score stood 5—4 in favor of the Cubs, both men settled down and neither side scored until in the fifth, Rodge, who had walked, came rushing home on an error and tied the score. The feature of the game was Josh’s desperate steal home, executing a painful slide over the cobbles, to the plate, his pain disappearing with the knowledge that he was ‘“‘safe.”’ Certainly the Band stock is going up by leaps and bounds.
