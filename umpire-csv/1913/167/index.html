<p>PLASTERERS vs STOCKING SHED May 19 The Bear-Cats Bryanized the Shed 16-1. Money kings and old time republicans quaked. Two southpaws toed the scratch, and only one finished. Curly pitched masterly ball after the first inning. He was wild only in that inning, and the Shed took advantage and scored their only tally. Curley had everything that bore resemblance to elusiveness. ‘That, and terrific hitting by his consistent teammates, rolled up a big score. The students proved quite friendly by beating the Ninth, and putting Plasterers in lead for pennant. Stump uncorked a home-run and a hit. Curley doubled twice. With two on bases, Felix cleared with a triple. Harry duplicated the performance later on. Felix also doubled. Harry, Tony, Fatty, Alex and Jim singled. Floyd, the other southpaw, was batted out of the box in the fourth; his straight ball was very easy to solve. Ducky stepped in and, even being wild, stopped the Bear-Cat’s clouting. The game was interspersed with ragged fielding and the opposite. When a fielder makes an error on an easy chance, the batter is not entitled to a hit. Eddie, umpire, knows his business. Rocky.</p>
