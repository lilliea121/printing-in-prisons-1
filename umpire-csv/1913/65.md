Politeness      THE man of perfect manners may, on tattered uppers go his way, and he will gain a host of friends, as on his toilsome way he wends. But gents whose manners are correct, don't need such hardship to expect; they mostly tread on joyous feet, along the pave of   Easy street. For men of courtesy and grace will find a welcome any place. They are not turned from any door; the merchant wants them in his store; wherever there are high priced snaps, there's a demand for gracious chaps, who have a stock of winning ways that they have carried all their days. These fellows get the best in life ; when one goes forth to seek a wife, the luscious damsels fairly scrap to get their talons on that chap. But never yet did pretty girl, distress herself to hook a churl. The courteous man finds life a feast, for him the good old world is greased, and when he dies the whole blamed town turns out to see him sodded down. These facts are known the whole world o'er; you'd think that men whose heads are sore would try to profit by the same, and quit their foolish, grouchy game. Politeness makes your life serene, then why be boorish, ugly, mean ? The more you deal in sass and slack, the more the world will hit you back. -Walt Mason.
