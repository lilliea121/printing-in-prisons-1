A Few Local Squibs      If knowledge is power, Overseer Joe Smith and John Myers, are powerful. Their knowledge of baseball, and their discussions on the fine points of the game, are both interesting and entertaining.   April showers bring May flowers, but they also bring gloomy expressions to most of the baseball enthusiasts around these parts.   The new Quartette made their initial bow, on the Sixth Block last Saturday evening, and they sure did make good, and then some.   The Rabbi refused an offer to umpire in the Southern League, when his con- tract runs out here. He seems to be afraid of the lynch law, in some of the Southern· States.   The Plasterers played “That Mysterious Band" on Thursday, and the Band played "I'm Afraid to go home in the dark." The day before the Ninth made the Cubs, "Go way back and sit down," While the Library showed the Stocking Shed, " A hot time in the old town tonight."
