LIBRARY vs CUBS    June 30    In a very fast played 8 inning game, well contested, and without the slightest dissension, the Cubs, after desperate fighting, won a lucky victory from the Library, 5—0. The Bookworms contested every inch of the journey, and clean up to the last inning, the game stood 2-0 against them, and at that stage, it was by no means a sure thing for the Cubs. Both teams fielded exceedingly well, and with the exception of some wild throwing, which virtually was the cause of 8 runs being scored, nothing better could have been expected. Tommy and Yeap both pitched a good game for their respective teams, and were in great form. —Henry.
