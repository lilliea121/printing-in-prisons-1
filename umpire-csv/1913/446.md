WHO’S WHO In MacKentieville Who umps, and umps, and umps some more, and renders decisions that make you sore? Who calls a ball a strike, and a strike a ball, and shouts “you're out,”’ when you are not at all? Who calls a bad foul, a very fair hit, and won’t renege; no never a bit? Who’s face beams joy and sweet content? Why that merry guy, that John Henry, gent.
