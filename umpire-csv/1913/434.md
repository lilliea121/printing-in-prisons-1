Athletics dropped another game to Chicago yesterday.John, captain of the Ninth desires us to state that if the members of his team continue to-play about and act like babies on the grounds instead of men, he will take steps, immediately, to trade such players. Swig has been transferred. to the Cubs from the Band, to supply the needs of the former for a catcher to replace little Freddie, who is out of the game for a while, with a sprained ankle.
