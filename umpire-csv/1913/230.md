PLAYERS TO REST THIS WEEK    Owing to the extremely hot weather, and the crippled condition of so many of the players, the Warden has very wisely determined that they should take the present week for a well-earned rest, and endeavor to recuperate from the effects of their strenuous work of the past two weeks. The games of next week will be played as scheduled. The three games of the present week will be played as the opportunity offers, throughout the season, which will now close October 3, instead of September 26.
