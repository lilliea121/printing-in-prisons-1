WHO’S WHO In Mackentieville    Who jingles his words in a jingling rhyme, and jingles his jingles toa jangling time? Who jingles his work, and jingles his play, and does nothing but jingle the whole of the day? Who jingled the Library, from third place to near last, and then jingled excuses, when assailed with a blast? Who jingles his way without favor, without dread, and is now jingling back, the hair on his head? Whose jingles are but bingles, to give the ears tingles? Why, that Schenectady gent, that near Poet Jingles.
