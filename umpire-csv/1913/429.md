A GLOBE TROTTING RECORD    A new world’s record in globetrotting was established last week by the arrival in New York of John Henry Mears, a newspaper man, who circled the world in the time of 35 days 21 hours 35 minutes and 4-5 of a second. Mr. Mears left New York about an hour after midnight on July 2 and traveled by way of Paris Harbin, Yokohama and Vancouver. Years ago, Jules Verne sent his mythical hero, Phineas Fogg, ‘“‘Around the world in Eighty Days” on an imaginary trip, which at that time was considered an impossibility. Since then however, Nellie Bly did it in 72 days, 6 hours and 11 minutes. Gaston Steigler in 73 days; Henry Frederick, 54 days 7 hours and 20 minutes, and Andre Jaeger-Schmidt, 39 days 19 hours, 431% minutes. That we will in the next few years be able to accomplish the feat within 30 days is no longer questioned.
