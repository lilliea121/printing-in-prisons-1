Answers to Correspondents   Conducted by Rocky   T.A. - You lose. George Washington is not living now.   Write to the postmaster at Holmesburg. He knows them all.   Karo Syrup is good for chapped hands. Write to manicuring department.   D.M.-You win. Peter Maher was never defeated.   We never heard of Lajoie.   To our knowledge your twenty-dollar gold piece, of that date, is not quoted at a premium. Send it to us for examination.   P.O.- The Warden will direct you to Market Street.   Soap and water will cure long-standing chilblains. Apply frequently.   Grapefruit eaten in the morning will remove the tendency to baldness.   Altruisim is derived from the Greek, Alto, meaning to sing, and ism from voices, meaning choir.
