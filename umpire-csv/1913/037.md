Pointed Puns       "Windley doesn't play the cornet any more, does he?"   "No; he thought he'd better give it up."   "Bad for his lungs, eh?"   "No ; it wasn't that. One of the neighbors shot two keys off the instrument while he was playing it."      His Motto.   A very small boy applied to a great merchant for a situation. The great man sized him up carefully and asked what position he wanted.   "A chance to grow up in the business."   "Well what is your motto, my son?"    "The same as yours."   “That do you mean?”   "Why, on the door there-'Push.’”
