LIBRARIANS BEAT BAND    July 11   The Band and Librarians came together today for the final game of their series, and fought it out for seven full innings resulting in a victory for the Jinglers by the score of 4—1. In the exuberance of his joy, Jingles fell from the Storehouse steps, and when he recovered himself, it was noticed that he was much taller than prior to the game. The Librarians had traded Yeap, for Ban J. of the Band, and both men represented their respective clubs in the box, in a manner that showed that the exchange was to their liking, for they excelled their previous performances. The game was well contested throughout, and up to the seventh inning when the score stood 2—1 in favor of the Bookmen, was ever doubtful. In the last inning however, two runs came rushing in for the Jingles bells and the game cinched. Bill a new one, essayed to umpire the bases, and did fairly well up to the fourth inning, when he called a Bandman out at third, who was palpably safe, and notwithstanding the kicks, refused to change his decision. Bill says, ‘‘ a umpire has to stand for some awful insults from players who can’t do as good.”’ Maybe the Librarians have struck their winning gait, and someone will be able to answer Jingles’ queries in another column. — Bill.
