AMONG THE POETS    Three Kings    Three Kings go riding into town, Under the fading sky; At dusk into small Bethlehem town Three Kings go riding by. Dim men ‘upon dim camels there, As in a dream of old; The tang of myrrh across the air; A wavering glint of gold. And all the folks come running out— They look so dim and high— From the gray doors the folks run out, To see three Kings go by. Silent they stand out in the lane, Along the fading ground. The camel’s hoofs strike thick and plain— It is the only sound. And after, not a word is spoke. They draw the latch and sigh. It is not oft that humble folk Do see three Kings go by. Three Kings ride into Bethlehem town, They ride from far and far; Three Kings go riding into town, Accompanied by a star. —Selected
