PLASTERERS vs CUBS A game in which nothing of special note transpired was played between the above teams Monday, and it culminated in a decisive defeat for the Cubs. Tommy and Yaller pitched, and both men were somewhat off color, which can be directly traced to overwork. Several free passes were presented by both, and the sequel was runs scored. The Plasterers scored 7 runs John, Augie, Andy, Toney 2 and Felix 2, one of which was a home run. Up to the last moment, the Cubs had not scored, and it was only in the nick of time that play to win. Jore made a dash and saved them from a shutout. e The game was attended by a great deal of tomfoolery, which fogged and annoyed the batsmen. A little of this sort of fun is all right, but it often leads to trouble. It would be much wiser, when the game is in progress, to be baseball enthusiasts than practical jokers. Result 7—1 Umpire Mack.  —Henry.
