CUBS WIN TIE GAME The tie game of last Friday between the Cubs and Band was played off Tuesday afternoon and resulted in a victory for the former by the score, 8—2. Tommy and Mike did the honors for the Cubs, while the Band essayed to do the trick with Yeap and Little Ike. Like all other recent games between these two teams, the play was full of interest, vim and fire, from the drop of the flag, to the sound of the whistle. Both pitchers were wild at times, but, good fielding held them up at critical moments. The Band lost at least three Opportunities to score by the failure of almost hopeless, and unnecessary attempts at base stealing, In the fourth Butt converted a single, into a home run, through a bunch of errors, and in the fifth, Jore walloped out one over the fifth block for about twenty bases. Swig and Dave who had been passed, were sent home by Slim’s hit in the fifth, making the only tallies for the band. Umpire, Mack. —Mitch.
