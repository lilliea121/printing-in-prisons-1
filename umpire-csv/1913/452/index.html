<p>BAND AND LIBRARY With Yeap and Louie on the mound the Library and Band met today for the second game of the week’s series. Both teams played good ball and it was only through lack of judgment and poor coaching, that the Jingle bells lost. Josh, for the Librarians in the first inning drove a ball over the First Block roof making a three bagger, but failed to score. In this inning Poet scored for the Band. In the beginning of the third inning Josh again drove a ball over the First Block roof making a home run. To Josh, therefore must be giving all credit, both for scoring and splendid playing, having scored the only run made by the Librarians, and assisting in six men out at third. The game stood tie, up until the seventh inning, and every one was expecting a replica of Monday’s game but in the seventh inning, Dave who had received free transportation, scored on an error, winning the game for the Band. Score 2—1. Umpire Lippy and Schmitty. —Millsy.</p>
