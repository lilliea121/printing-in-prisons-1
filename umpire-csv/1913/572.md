CECILIAN CHORAL CONCERT    The ‘‘Cecilian Choral,” under the auspices of the American Society for Visiting Catholic Prisoners, and conducted by Mr. Frank J. Crowley, gave an enjoyable Sacred Concert on the Center last Sunday afternoon. The program was unusually good and exceptionally well rendered. The soprano solo, ‘‘Ave Maria,” and the “Gloria” from St. Cecilia’s Mass being particularly worthy, and greatly appreciated by the inmates. Those taking part in the entertainment, were Messrs. Frank J. Crowley, John J. Ranson, J. Aloysius Smith, R. S. McCarthy, and Mesdames, Stephen Ruth, Catherine Ryan, and Margaret Sloan, with Miss Mary McEntee as the accompanist.
