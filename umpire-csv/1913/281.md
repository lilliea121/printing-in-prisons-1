NINTH vs PLASTERERS    June 30    There was a great game of ball between the Ninth and Plasterers this afternoon, which was won by the former in the last half of the last inning, when Yaller, the Plasterers speedy hurler, weakened, and four runs tallied against him. Up to this time he pitched wonderfully good ball, striking out nine, of the seventeen men who faced him, and allowing only one hit, but, that one for a home run by Eggie. At the beginning of the sixth inning, the score stood 1-1 with Plasterers up. Stump hit Bill for a clean homer and then pandemonium reigned among the Plasterers’ rooters. Tony struck out, Felix hit, stole around to third and Andy knocked a beauty over the wall and—out. ; In their half, the Ninth led with Bill, who singled, and then Chef found the ball for a clout around the bases, chasing Bill in all the way. Rube singled, stole second, coming home on Lefty’s two-bagger, who in turn was sent in by some one’s two-base hit. Net result four runs. Score 5-2. The game was remarkably free from errors and marked throughout by snappy playing. Yaller distinguished himself in the box, in the field and at the bat, bringing in one of the two runs of the Plasterers. Umpire Mack. — Mitch.
