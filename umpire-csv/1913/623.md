THE SAME ENTHUSIASM which attended Col. Roosevelt on his European trip several years ago has followed him to South America, where he is giving the people of that country the benefit of his wide experience, and it is supposed, incidentally telling them how to run their government. He has been met by enormous crowds amid the salvos of heavy guns, and manifestations usually accorded only to monarchs.    Recently he addressed an immense audience in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on the subject of “Character and Civilization,” in which he defined character, as the sum of those qualities distinct from the purely intellectual qualities which are essential to moral efficiency. He said: “Reformation, courage, energy, power of self-control, combined with fearlessness in taking the initiative, and assuming responsibility; a just regard for the rights of others, with unflinching determination to succeed no matter what obstacles and barriers have to be beaten down, are all essential. There is, moreover, one other quality too often lacking in men of high intellectual ability, without which real character cannot exist, namely: the mental gift of commonsense.”
