Library Beat Cubs   Game to be Protested, Owing to the Library Using Borrowed Pitcher   The game on Monday, between the Library and Cubs, will no doubt be protested. The score was 2 to 0, in favor of the Library; but it seems that the pitcher used by the Library belongs to the Stocking Shed. The Stocking Shed is in no condition to let out a pitcher like Tommy, and we think the deal should be looked into, and see if everything is fair and above board. ‘The Editor has no knowledge of the game as played, as we stated elsewhere in this issue, our correspondents were all at the Ninth—Plasterers game.    The Cubs put up a good game from all accounts, and the Library barely won out. Of course, the Library did not have their strongest team in the field, but they needed it. We hope that the future games can be so arranged that the details will be more complete.
