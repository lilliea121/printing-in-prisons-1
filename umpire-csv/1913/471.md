WITH THE POETS YOU FIRST.    It doesn’t cost a penny,    No matter who you be,    To wish a man ‘‘good morning,”    And thereby let him see,    You know that he is living,    And know he’s human too;    It’s better, too, for you.    It doesn’t cost a penny,    To always be polite,    And if the world would heed it,    There’d never be a fight,    Just think how very happy    Our lives would be and true,    If everyone would whisper,    “Alphonso, after you.”   -- Pliny
