CUBS 10 STOCKING SHED 0 An alleged game of ball was played between above teams to the tune of ‘Please go ‘way and let me sleep.” Cubs battered the old Shed down in this manner: Woody doubled twice. Charlie in singled and doubled. Herb got two hits. Freddy got two singles and a double; Butler, Miller and Manager, each got a hit. Some neat catches were made. Third baseman of Shed fielded fast. An uninteresting game that spelled lethargy and listless. With few exceptions, everybody seemed, oh, so tired! Lack of ginger featured the game, and spectators heaved a sigh of relief when game stopped. Umpire behind plate spoke in whispers, so sleepers would not be disturbed. Ye olde scribe missed a good game between Wake up, boys, wake up! ! Rocky.
