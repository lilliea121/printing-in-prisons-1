Geno Ferranao was 21 year old Italian man who was imprisoned at Eastern State Pennitetury  for assault battery and rape in the year 1911.  He was sentenced to a maximum 15 years in prison, but only served seven.  He was a Catholic man who was a baker for a living, with a wife and no children. 
This page from Eastern Echoes emphasizes the immense concern surrounding prisons, and how their lack of progression throughout the years has been a failure. Eastern State Penitentiary in the early 1900s used a model called reform. This method prisoners were thought to reform the individual by making them more moral, which would naturally make them turn away from their crime and not commit any more offenses upon their release.It would alter character traits, motivation or dispositions. In the 1950s, when this article was made, the method prisons used was changed to rehabilitation. This refers to improving someone's skills, capacities, and opportunities, which expands to psychological interventions aimed at correcting offenders.  The difference between this and reform is that rehabilitation aims at improvement of skills, capacities, and opportunities rather than altering it.
Geno, expressed in his publication, seemed to show signs of regret and change, which would make his time in jail a success. The page from Eastern Echoes, which was written nearly 50 years after Genos' time, strongly points out how much of a failure the prison system is, under rehabilitation. Those particular fellows that have done the most damage and a few who ought to be in jail for a long time, usually get out in a few years and go back to their old tricks.The jail that was supposed to reform the offender, or change him, fails to do so, and in that process teaches him some new tricks, ruins his chance of getting a job and costs the state a lot of money.
This comparison between the two different time periods suggest the progression of prisons throughout the years. Eastern Echoes contradicts the exact thing that Geno was expressing in his publication. As Geno suggests he is a changed man through the prison system, we see a completely different approach, where the author of the article in Eastern Echoes says the total opposite, and how badly of a failure the prison system has been. 
So why do we have this case? Geno, where he was put through the method of reform, and the evidence provided to us shows signs of change and regret, but on the Eastern Echoes page, 50+ years after Geno, the prison system is still a failure? 
The answer isn't clear, but as a whole, the prison system has, and will continue to fail people inside and outside of prison. The report examined the existing evidence on prisoner rehabilitation programs and came to the conclusion that nothing works. Still to this day, the fact that the majority of incarcerated people do not change shows how the prison system in our country is a failure, and a change is needed. 
Eastern State Penitentiary was considered quite progressive compared to other prisons in the 1910s . It was quite advanced in how they treated their inmates, possibly hoping to change them. This is relevant to Geno because of the regret he displays in his publication to the warden. This regret highlights reflection of his time being incarcerated and how it has affected him. The question here is do we trust 
him? Can we trust him?  Geno talks as though he is a changed man, but we have to look at the circumstances and the situation he is in. While he was saying this, he was in a  publication sanctioned by the warden, so could all this be an act where he is trying to look good for parole?  It's very hard to decipher what's right or what's wrong. Especially when we don't know the person.  This duality opens up these texts to multiple interpretations, and if prisons can change people for the good, or if incarcerated people can never change within this kind of prison system. 
Genos' publication, as said before, reflects Genos' time in prison, and how he feels about it. Evidently, Geno shows signs of regret and change. We see here an incarcerated person reflecting on his time in jail in a public setting, in front of the warden, to try and look better for parole. Reading this kind of article, just like the Eastern Echoes article, it is crucial to keep in fact these writers at these different moments in history reflect what that institution wants them to say, suggesting that we need to read the entire archive with a healthy skepticism. To extend on this, we should also read with an eye to all the potential audiences during the archives creation. 
Suggesting all of this, Genos' publication can be looked at two different ways: Is he lying to try and look better for parole, or is he telling the truth. Can us as the audience trust him? Or can we not?
Geno, although he was put through a very progressive prison for his time period, and showed signs of change, could be completely lying and could be the same person he was when he got into the prison. This all starts with the word criminal and how stigmatizing it is. Even if Geno is telling the truth, is the public going to look at him as somebody who served his rightful time and is free, or will he always be incarcerated by the public, even if not physically? Here we have to do some humanizing, and realize the stereotype surrounding criminals plays a factor in why prison systems are a failure. Even when 100+ years go by, we still consider these people as criminals.
