## Introduction
When we think about prisons, including Eastern State Penitentiary, we often imagine seclusion and suffering, rather than freedom of expression or creativity. However, the pages of The Umpire, a newspaper publication from within the prison walls, reveal a different story. A story where incarcerated individuals were free to use their skills and creativity to make homemade products that could be bought and sold. This aspect of prison life, which tends to be overlooked, highlights the adaptability and humanity of these individuals, who, even in captivity, found ways to be an instrumental part of their community by expressing themselves in impactful ways. Through their creations and trades, they built for themselves a sense of purpose and bond that pushed past their current circumstances, challenging the belief of prison as solely correctional. Pictured above is an example of an ad section in The Umpire that portrays items for sale in and around 1913.

## Edward Franklin
Edward Franklin, better known as "Jingles," was a passionate poet from New York City whose talents reached far beyond poetry. His love for creating and sharing his passions did not end following his sentencing. At the age of 24, Edward continued to focus his creativity into writing heartfelt poems, which can be seen by the image on the right, and making cards that brought moments of light to his peers. Jingles’s poems were published a number of times throughout his years at Eastern State highlighting how his peers received his words.  Through his crafts, he spread joy, reminding everyone around him that their lives held meaning far beyond the physical prison walls. These cards and poems celebrated holidays, milestones, and small triumphs, helping his fellow inmates feel connected to a world that often felt far off. Jingles’ efforts highlighted the need for community and love, even in the most isolated circumstances. His legacy portrays how creativity and human connection can flourish in unlikely places, challenging the belief of prison as solely a place of punishment and correction.

## Peter Marcelis
Peter Marcelis of Philadelphia, PA, spent his time at Eastern State Penitentiary creating scarves, shawls, and ball tidies, a meaningful craft. He was thoughtful in creating these goods unique to the buyer, as he offered a multiple of colors. These handmade scarves and shawls did more than provide warmth within the cold prison walls. Some were gifted to loved ones outside, offering a physical connection to those they missed. Through his crafts, Peter created an environment of comfort and connectivity, bridging the gap between incarcerated life and the outside world.

## Conclusion
Life at Eastern State in the early twentieth century was much more than just confinement. Incarcerated individuals like Edward and Peter found ways to express their passions and creativity, fostering connection and a sense of belonging among their peers. These various talents and crafts highlight that, even within prison walls, individuals continue to find purpose and contribute to their communities. As humans, we are driven to share our talents, and it’s important to recognize and celebrate these individuals as part of a larger community. By honoring their resilience and creativity, we attest that their lives hold meaning, reminding us that human love and connection can flourish, even in the most challenging places.
