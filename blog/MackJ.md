# Barbershops Talks Behind Bars: The Forgotten Community Spaces of Eastern State Penitentiary

When you think about what life is like in prisons, community is not  
what comes to mind first, especially at Eastern State Penitentiary located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  
The dehumanizing aspects of prisons such as confinement, isolation, and strict codes of silence were founded  
at the harsh Eastern State Penitentiary back in the 19th century, giving the prison the reputation  
of being one of the most infamous in American history. However, there were spaces that fostered  
a sense of community within the prison and beyond - the barbershop.

I grew up in a barbershop where my friends and I would hang out, even  
if we weren't getting haircuts. From conversations about LeBron vs. Jordan, generating generational wealth,  
or even just talking about upcoming school assignments, the barbershop served as a free space  
for me to express my feelings and emotions as a Black man. After school, when my  
friends and I did not feel like going home to do chores, we would stop  
by the barbershop to check in with our barber/mentor, as well as play video games and hang out.  
I never took this space for granted because there are not many spaces that  
can replicate the freedom barbershops grant Black men in communities across America.

Similarly, barbershops played a major role in defying the dehumanizing culture of solitary confinement  
and isolation in Eastern State Penitentiary. Historical documents state that there was at least one  
cell on every cell block that was vacant and dedicated to serve as a barbershop,  
quickly becoming a hub where inmates could convene. In a prison where inmates  
were expected to stay in solitary confinement for most of the day and would be  
punished if they attempted to communicate with each other while in their respective cells,  
many inmates sought out an outlet to engage in human interaction again. While  
baseball and other sports fostered community outside on the cell blocks in the yard,  
there were no spaces within the cell blocks for the inmates to be human besides  
the barbershops.

Even prison guards supported inmate barbers by receiving haircuts and even bringing  
in family members to get a cut, granting inmate barbers with more customers.  
This dynamic between guards and prisoners present within the barbershops demonstrates  
the trust that the guards had for the inmates as humans, for nobody would  
recommend a barber to friends and family if they were not confident in the outcome  
of the haircut. Considering the malicious relationships guards often had with inmates,  
it is clear to see the impact the barbershop had on fostering a great community  
by bringing people together.

Often, prisoners were stripped of their freedom to just talk in a safe space,  
which is why these spaces were so important to every cell block. Men historically  
have faced many challenges in society pertaining to expressing their emotions and feelings,  
and prisoners had it even worse. Gaining the freedom to just be human again  
by socializing in the barbershop must have boosted the mental health of many inmates  
as they escaped the shackles of isolation, although that is not the only freedom  
that the barbershops granted inmates. Barbershops also fostered economic growth within the  
prison and outside.

Running your own business within the prison equipped the inmates with specific qualities  
and skill sets that could perhaps be pursued as a potential career as a barber  
in the future. The State Barber Board wrote in the *Eastern Echo Newspaper* that  
inmate barbers were required to pass a written examination in addition to demonstrating  
niche barber skills to officially become an inmate barber. These skills that  
were honed within the prison often encouraged inmates to better their life after prison.  
Black barbershops have long been spaces of cultural significance and economic opportunities  
by generating local employment and small business growth in communities across the country,  
and it is not implausible to connect this long-lasting history to the skillsets  
that were obtained in prisons.

The prison barbershop wasn't just a place to get a haircut. The spaces  
played an integral role in fostering relationships, increasing mental health, and  
promoting economic growth inside and outside of Eastern State Penitentiary. The  
history of barbershops within Eastern State directly mirrors the historical impact  
barbershops have had on many nationwide, particularly African American communities.  
These spaces served as a reminder of freedom, connection, and possibilities to the  
inmates of Eastern State Penitentiary.
