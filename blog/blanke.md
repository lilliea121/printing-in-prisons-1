Born in Germany, Metzler moved to Philadelphia when he was 20, and worked as a carousel operator before entering Eastern State Penitentiary. John Metzler was sentenced to 4-10 years in prison, but was released on September 9, 1916, exactly 4 years after imprisonment. During his last year, Metlzer donated 30 cents to the Childrens’ Christmas Fund.
