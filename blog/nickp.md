## A Tale of a Walled Town by Clarence Alexander Rea

_Extract taken from Prologue of A Tale of a Walled Town_

Wrote Clarence Alexander Rea of the Eastern State Penitentiary. Trapped within the walled town, incarcerated person B8266, as he was known as by readers of The Umpire, rose through the ranks to become a leader within the community. First a scribe for the prison’s Honor and Friendship Club whose updates had to be approved by its vice president, he eventually was elected secretary of the club – a club which created entertainment for those in the prison from comedic and music performances to informal baseball games, perhaps a respite from the gruelling solitary nature of life in the prison. He later became editor of The Umpire itself and the main contributor of news articles to the newspaper. However, he was also known for the poems he would often pen in the paper. Such was his talent that a book of his works edited by William Stanley Braithwaite containing the poem read throughout this piece was published while he was still imprisoned in 1921.

The poem tells of a man whose pursuit of love led him down the wrong path. A man whose youthful love found a woman whom he proceeded to marry. However, as his love for her grew, so did her desire for luxury, as did the pressure on him to provide for a lifestyle he couldn’t afford himself.

All the pressure and desperation gnawed at him, and he eventually gave in. He found himself entangled in a web of theft to satisfy her material needs. It was not long before he was caught and apprehended to seven years in prison. However, upon his release, having just lost out on the prime of his youth, he came back to see the same woman now wedded to a man richer than him – a tragedy which led him to commit the crime for which he was now supposedly incarcerated. You can only help but feel a deep sense of sympathy for a man deprived of his youth by the same woman who had betrayed him.

Perhaps, it is worth viewing Clarence Alexander Rea not as an incarcerated person but an artist whose circumstances had turned into an incarcerated person whose dreams and imaginations still roam free, exploring the world outside the walled town. Not only did he find solace in reading the latest literary magazines, staying updated by reading the latest issue of Literary Digest, but he was also an admirer of the classical greats in Ovid and Aristophanes by whom his writing was greatly influenced.

Indeed, for his great poetry, he was eventually freed from the penitentiary on December 3rd, 1923. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, his stay was cut short by 3 years, as he was seen to have shown his ‘spiritual quality’ through his writings – the state board of pardons recommended his release following the publishing of two volumes of his verse, including a Tale of a Walled Town. After all, the Eastern State Penitentiary was founded on a model replicated globally that believed that incarcerated persons should be locked in, not for punishment, but to encourage penitence – through his writings, Clarence Alexander Rea had proved that he was no longer his old self.

Or was he? Clarence Alexander Rea’s prison records suggest that he was incarcerated for enticing a boarding house mistress away for sodomy and buggery, then stealing money from her. Indeed, his criminal records suggest his previous convictions were for larceny that matched not what was penned in his poem but something completely different. He was sentenced to a year at the Huntingdon Reformatory whose own records corroborate this information. Was everything experienced in a Tale of a Walled Town simply in his dreams and imaginations? Perhaps a creative dissonance?
