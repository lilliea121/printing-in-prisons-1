    <p> Walter Gala was a Philadelphia native who became a practiced nurse during his incarceration at Eastern State Penitentiary between 1949 and 1967 for the first-degree murder of his wife, 22-year old Ruth Gala. He appears in the record through census records listing basic information, news coverage over the murder that led to his incarceration and his eventual commutation, and features in Eastern State’s prison newspaper, the Eastern Echo. In order to understand his life, it’s necessary to look between the details provided in institutional sources and news coverage, recognizing the socioeconomic trends and personal relationships that shaped it. Placing him in relation to his family and structures provides greater context on both how his life appears in the public record and the significance of his incarceration within his life’s trajectory. He is also my great-uncle, and consideration of my connection to a historic institution dedicated to incarceration through his imprisonment has led to greater reflection on the presence of the carceral system in present-day Philadelphia, as well as the value of printing through prison periodicals. </p>
