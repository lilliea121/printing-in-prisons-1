“CIRCUMSTANCE plus the WILL TO LIVE equals WHY men act as they do.”

that phenomenon by which every particle of matter
in the universe tends toward every other particle.
Obviously, the current, so called ‘‘clnical’’ remedy
to the problem of crime is practically useless since
it cannot treat or alter a quality which is the un-
extinguishable essense of man’s nature—THE WILL
TO LIVE. The endless scrutinizing of that trans-
parent layer which is his personality serves no
purpose other than to provide an agreeable means
of spending eight hours for men who ean find no
more realistic occupation for themselves in this area.
The results of a discourse between Man **A’’ who
possesses a smattering of ignorance about himself
and Man ‘‘B’’ who is more ignorant about himself than
Man ‘‘A’’ is bound to be, if not downright ludicrous,
bizarre and out of touch with the square business
of crime. Indeed, what are all these attitudes and
personalities in the cosmological scheme of things—
shadows ... hueless images of a compelling substance
at the very bottom of all human action, relentlessly
discharging itself, oblivious of the social implica-
tions of its conduct. Man behaves not as he would
like necessarily, but as he does. But the criminal is
mou a beme® apart. le is every man. He is: YOU.
There should be no turning away from this truth.
To know man is to know the criminal. It is hypo-
eritical deception to think otherwise in view of the
complete lack of evidence to support any notion that
he differs a single mote from law-abiding citizenry.

If man is eternally committed to the practice
of predacity in one form or another to achieve some
measure of gratification for the infinitely complex
variety of desires which assail him, is it the destiny
of society to inevitably yield to so vicious a law?
Yes. This is in the nature of things. But to submit
is not to abandon the cause. Through the ages the
human animal has shaped and reshaped his environ-
ment so as to allow more freedom and greater
opportunities to discharge his feral urges in manners
beneficial to communal interest. Unsocial conditions
foster unsocial behavior. Clearly, in proportion to
the extent of imagination men display in raising
the material circumstances of every single human

being, in every nook and erevice of society, in altering
the conditions of his environment so as to bring
unsocial conditions to an irreducible minimum; in
modifying those moral sanctions which attempt to
restrict the healthy instincts of man—yust in that
proportion will he reap the harvest of decrement in
that mode of behavior he cannot now but regard as
eriminal.

Despite the phenomenal progress made in the
realm of physical science, man remains appallingly
barbaric in knowledge about himself. He rewards
this action and punishes that. He praises another
and denounces still others. And this is the measure
of his ignorance of the operative forces which impel
him. Perhaps many more hundreds of years will
have to unfold before man becomes sufficiently scien-
tific to waive sacrosanct precepts of morality, and
turn away trom what he cannot ever hope to alter,
and concentrate his efforts upon those things that lie
within his power to change—his environment. Un-
til the challenge, posed by the knowledge of what man
really is, fires his imagination sufficiently, man can-
not feel the need for the dynamic changes in the
economic and social structure of his environment so
necessary for what 1s commonly referred to as a
‘healthy society.’’ But it is a harsh truth that where
there are socio-economic imbalances as exist in
our society, and where men are without the necessary
tools or opportunities to provide for themselves ade-
quately within the social orbit, there is no mit. to the
effort they will make to secure what they regard as
necessary to their subsistance outside of it. Again in
a society such as ours, where countless networks of
moral strictures limit the flow of healthy instincts,
there is no end to the distortions or a hmit to
the violence the human aninial will display to assert
its power simply to be. Think on it!

Meanwhile, crime continues unabated, and those
festering, poverty ridden, down-trodden areas which
poek-mark the face of society remain untouched by
human hands, to spawn other generations of criminals
and to provide stomping grounds for the present crop.

‘‘The Greeks studied man and the laws of life as they found them. And they realized
profoundly, as we have forgotten—to the negation of life—that virtue consists not in
denying the nature of man, but in so developing all elements of it into such an efficient,
beautiful and harmonious whole that of his life each (man) creates a work of art.’’
