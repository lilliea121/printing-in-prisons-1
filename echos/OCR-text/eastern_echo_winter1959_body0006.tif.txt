Crime, Time, and Punishment

by SPENCER WALDEN

“NOU Camino make a) Sillik jOUIeSE TRO a Sor Ss
ear,” is an age-old adage. Although its origin has
been lost in antiquity, the saying itself became a ehal-
lenge to the ingenuity of modern man. As a result,
not too long ago scientists actually created a purse
trom a sow’s ear. It wasn’t composed of silk, but it
is expected to outlast the longevity of any silken
counterpart.

Perhaps this may not be as newsworthy as an
earth-circling satellite, or a new rock and roll hit;
nonetheless, it serves to illustrate a fact — the effect
of a challenge upon man.

“You cannot make anything out of a convict,” is
a comment all too often repeated by the uninformed
cynic. This, too, is a challenge that will someday be
accepted by some individual or group, perhaps non-
conformists in their manner of reasoning, who will
disprove this statement. In so doing, they will neces-
sarily bring into ae new and revolutionary social
concepts capable of firing the imagination.

Records, of a sort, have been kept on penology
dating back two thousand odd years when law-
breakers were first cast into cages, pens and dun-
gcons. With slight alter ‘ations in mode and manner,
this same method of dealing with lawbreakers, it
must be admitted, remains in effect.

Surely, it seems, civilized society, or some seg-
ment of it, could create a better Sion Tor the iamid=
ling of today’s lawbreakers. It would appear that no
other social condition has so stymied man as the
problem of what to do, or what should be done, with
those who break the law. If the total sum expended
on the building and maintenance a prisons in this
country could be made a matter of public record, a
demand for a new system of penology would prob-
ably result more swiftly. Hach year fiscal appropri-
ations for our state and national penal systems soar
by additional millions of dollars, yet few are those
who question whether prisons are the answer to
Crime,

Although countless suggestions have been ad-
vanced for handling crime and punishment problems,
they usually have, in varying degrees, one thing in
common — from the naive to the opposite extreme,
they are tinged with a vindictive strain. And, all too
often, the avenging angels would sink beneath the
level of those they would destroy.

Occasionally practical suggestions are advo-
cated. However, these are usually shelved .by yet
more practical politicians. Hence, down through
the ages man has been cursed by the blight of
prisons.

A theoretical change for the better in the field
of penology was hoped for with the adoption of pa-
role; so too, hope motivated that most “noble experi-
ment’ ce alled prohibition. There were, and are, of
course, those who benefited by both.

One would be inclined to the conclusion that at

least the judges with their experience would come
forth, if not with solutions, with down to earth sug-
gestions as to how crime and punishment problems
should be handled on a humane and practical basis.

Unitortunately, the majority of judges today,
like their predecessors, have shown an ostrich-like
attitude and closed their eyes, cars and minds to the
problems of crime and punishment. <As evidence we
submit the fact that of the thousands of judges who
warm the benches in the courtrooms of this nation,
only an infinitesimal fraction have visited a penal
institution.

Time worn procedures dealing with crime and
punishment have failed, and miserably so. As an
antidote for crime, courts and penal institutions have
created far more social problems than it was hoped
they would solve. Neither has been an effective de-
TEIMKC MNT.

Whether the lawbreaker is born or made, and
whether he should be held accountable for his mis-
deeds are not problems to be solved with either the
heart or the mind alone. Neither organ is infallible
nor weighs the facts in an equitable manner. The
heart of the problem, in the majority of instances, is
to be found in social economie conditions that furnish
opportunities for lawbreakne.

Why not remove these conditions? Is this sit-
uation too much for society to cope with? Is it
cheaper for socicty to continue to pay the price for
anti-social conditions than to attempt to solve them?

Obviously we are not all born with the same as-
sets; the same measure of insight; the same ability
to analyze conditions and situations, or to judee
those in whom we place or misplace confidence.
Many are the crimes chareed to those who have acted
solely in good faith.

It is far easier to make than to unmake the law-
breaker. The formula for making one is rather well
established :—Take the youth who has known but a
bare existence; make crime books and crime maga-
zines available to him; cram his leisure hours with
movic, radio and television crime programs until his
mind is conditioned; then tempt him with erime
where material reward is available. Sooner or later
the inevitable follows in natural sequence.

Unfortunately there is no known formula for
unmaking the lawbreaker. This is not to state, how-
ever, that new and untried methods cannot be insti-
tuted that will be effective. Methods of the past
have been, and will continue to be ineffectual, and
have as a result brought about their condemnation,

How, after two thousand years of observation,
can we still expect a vindictive form of punishment
to bring moral and spiritual changes for the better?
Prisons. represent the greatest waste area of life, and
1 (OIISOM TS iO) lore found the most tragic waste of all
—the criminal waste of the human mind and soul.

It has been said that by following the line of
least resistance both men and rivers have become
crooked, yet we have all seen the course of both
