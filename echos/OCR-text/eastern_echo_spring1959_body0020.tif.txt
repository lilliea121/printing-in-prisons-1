THE 7

BEES e
MAHA

A few miles from Nagpur and the east-west
railway, a man and a woman and their two horses
rested in the welcome shade of a banyan tree.
Around and above stood tawny, sun-seared_ hills,—
the lonely Maha Dayo hills of central India.

The young Englishwoman watched the man pre-
pare tea, vexation in her dark eyes. She was a
slender, graceful woman, quite lovely—and quite
ill. Her stocky, florid husband’s slow but sure dex-
terity irritated her. Impatiently, she tossed her long,
thick hair like a cross child.

“Stephen, do you think Sidi will get back with
the medicine before dark?”

Stephen Gaylord smiled indulgently at his wife,
picked up his field-glasses and climbed a rock at the
edge of the road. As far as he could see, there was |
nothing but dusty road and the shimmering heat
waves. The sweet fragrance of wild honey filled the
air; high on the steep wall of a nearby ravine hung
the huge nests of the giant bees of Maha Dayo.
Stephen lowered the glasses, climbed down from the
rock and went over to his wife.
