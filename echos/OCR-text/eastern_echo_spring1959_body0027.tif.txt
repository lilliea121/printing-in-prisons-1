ing honors for the Celtics were shared jointly by
Adderly, Moose and Lefty. Junebug and Ray com-
bined to do a tremendous rebounding job in the
first-half but, when the Warriors began their in-
spired victory drive, the Celtics had insufficient de-
fensive power to halt the surge.

It was apparent that Adderly’s play paced the
Celtics, but as the season progressed there just was-
n’t enough offense to balance the stiff defense of the
Celtics. The team, as a whole, can be very proud of
their play in the league, and your reporter votes an
E for Effort to them for always staying in the game
until the final whistle. No team need feel bad in de-
feat when they have fought so hard to win.

The Hawks placed a versatile team on the court.
With an offense and defense sparked by Tookie,
Pinky ole’ Reliable O’Brien, the Hawks played pre-
cision smooth basketball. Yet, somehow, their fast-
break to outrace the other teams began to slow down.
The Hawks continued to play capable ball through-
out the season but just couldn’t seem to recapture
the form that would have netted them the champion-
ship. Tookie led in scoring with a total of 145 points
with Pinky, the versatile Manager, coming in second
with a total of 118 points. Watching the Hawks in
action, it was noticed that there were belated bursts
of scoring, combined with a fine competitiveness.
Had they retained this form, with which they began
the season, they would have had a better than wish-
on-the moon chance of copping the laurels.

So, let’s congratulate the Hawks and extend
wishes for “Better Luck next year.”

Unfortunately, we cannot present Manager
Shakey and his Warriors with a fitting trophy, but
we can applaud them for their very fine performance.
Featuring three Varsity players in Woody, Fricker
and Shakey, the Warriors had their objective sighted
from the very start. Throughout the season this was
never a one-man show. The fighting Warriors hus-
tled all the way and overcame each hurdle that faced
them in their drive for the championship. You just
can’t keep a Champion down.

Congratulations Warriors! It was a fine season
and a well-earned victory for a deserving team.

A final thought: Build now for a better season
that is surely on the way, and keep in mind that

a winner never quits and a quitter never wins.”

SPORTS ITEMS

Joe McNeair, ECHO
Sports Editor, in an inter-
view with Supt. Banmil-
ler, learned that at the
present time we cannot be permitted to watch TV
Boxing. Mr. Banmiller said, “I can understand the
fellows’ desire to view TV fights, but the time has
to be considered. It would be almost 11 o’clock be-
fore a ten-round fight would be over, and that’s too
late.”

BOXING

A six-team - Softball
League is being formed
under the direction of Mr.
Thomas H. Graham, Di-
reetor of Athletics. League games will be played in
the 3-Block Recreation Yard. All men interested in

playing are to turn in their names to Mr. Graham
before March 2nd, 1959.

SOFTBALL

It is reported that the
Chapel Basketball Court
is to be macadamized in

dles to contend with!

BASKETBALL

In a post-dinner chat,
upon being informed that
one of our teams under
Little Mae’s leadership
had a season such as the Eagles did in 1958, Bucko
Kilroy, Eagles’ great, and recent visitor, replied,
“yerhaps he could use our scores for the coming
year.”
