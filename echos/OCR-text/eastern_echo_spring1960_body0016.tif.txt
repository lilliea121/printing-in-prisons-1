Study in Contrasts

William Brown, after serving thirty-one years on
a life sentence, has been granted a commutation of
sentence, which will enable him to be released short-
ly. He, along with another inmate who has served
twenty-eight and a half years, are the first lifer’s to
be commutated under the present Pardon Board. In
an attempt to portray more vividly the long span of
time he has spent behind prison walls, we offer the
following study of contrast:
