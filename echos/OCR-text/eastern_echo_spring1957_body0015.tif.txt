lations are the result of a too stringent interpre-
tation of the rules; interpretation without humane
tolerance. A man leaving a penal institution can no
more become a paragon of virtue than can the
average member of society. He is still a human
being, still hable to human error and failure. Many
technical violations are the results of infractions
for which the average citizen would go unpunished
or perhaps receive a fine for committing a misde-
meanor. Why should a man, simply because he is
a parolee, be re-committed to serve from one to five
years or more for a similar infraction? Naturally,
some of the regulations must be strictly enforced.
For instance, a parolee failing to report regularly
or moving to another state without permission, has
deliberately violated the conditions of his parole
and should be punished. However, minor lapses in
human conduct should be regarded as human and
treated as such.

3. Parole agents should be fully qualified for
their position in the same manner as members of the
Parole Board. Having within their hands the power
to arbitrarily remove a man from his freedom and
the great responsibility of controlling a man’s life,
they should be paid accordingly. A salary commen-
surate to their responsibility would attract the best
trained men and place them above such emotions
as jealousy of the parolee’s higher earnings and
the possible temptation to augment their income by
other means within their power.

They should regard themselves as “‘parole
agents’’ and not as ‘‘police officers,’’ and seek to
lend a helping hand to the parolee who falters mo-
mentarily in some minor way, rather than regard the
moment as an opportunity to return the man to
prison. Although parole agents are public officers,
their work is highly personal, and they should re-
frain from making the parolee’s life more difficult
by making the fact that he is on parole a subject for
public discussion. A parolee is under a great
enough handicap without telling the world that he
is an ex-convict to be regarded with suspicion,
and he should be treated as the citizen he is trying to
be, not the criminal he was before.

Parole investigations should be conducted more
discreetly than they are at the present. A parole
agent, with the facilities at his command, should
be able to thoroughly investigate a parolee’s life
without informing every neighbor of the fact that
the man is an ‘‘ex-con.’’ Surely such a public pro-

clamation is unnecessary and the same information
could be derived by other means. Could any citizen,
never before in any serious difficulty, live his life in
peace if someone were to expose to all his neighbors
and friends, the skeletons in his closet of the past?
If not, then we cannot expect the parolee to become
a successful citizen under such procedures.

The parole agent’s privilege of entering the
parolee’s home or place of work at any time should
not be abused. Supervision is definitely necessary
but can go to such an extreme it defeats itself. Why
should a parolee be repeatedly submitted to a public
indignity which shames him in front of his fellow
employees and friends? Could any citizen live
peacefully under such conditions? If not, then we
cannot truthfully expect the parolee to become a
proper citizen.

4, The public should be conditioned to try to
accept the parolee on the basis of his present be-
havior, not his past. They should not be expected to
embrace him as a brother, but to allow him to live

among them as they do orher so long as he merits
their tolerance.

One of the great problems faced by the parolee
is the attendant adverse publicity when he is re-
leased from an institution. This is usually the case
when the newspapers or other media represent the
opposing political party, and attempt to create a
political issue in this manner. The publicity is
usually greatly out of proportion in relation to the
newsworthiness of the item. If the newspapers
truly believed that the public should be informed in
screaming headlines that a man has been paroled,
why not go further and inform the public when a
person is released from an insane asylum, tubercu-
losis sanatorium, or venereal disease ward. Such
people, just as the parolee, were at one time danger-
ous to society but have been released as cured, and
are allowed to start their life without poplienye) be-
cause they are not a political issue.

In summary, there is only one major issue.
Progressive penology, with all its Staff Boards,
Treatment Programs, Therapy Classes, Rehabilita-
tion Programs, and the like, cannot be successful in
its alms without a correspondingly progressive pa-
role system. The problem is a public responsibility,
and only the public can initiate action which will
enable the modern penologist to do his work with the
knowledge that his accomplishments will no longer
be undone by an antiquated parole system.

Herbert Brownell, J r., Attorney General of the United States, speaking at
the National Conference on Parole, remarked:
