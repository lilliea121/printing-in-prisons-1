He lived in a large home on a quiet residential
street. The meek little man was a scholarly, reserved
fellow who never seemed to be disturbed by his wife’s
incessant nagging and complaining, always demand-
ing of him, “Do this or do that, don’t you dare come
home without doing something or other.” Poor man,

all he would ever say was, “Yes, dear.” A timid soul
indeed!

His typical day began when he left the house
promptly at 8:30, and arrived fifteen minutes later at

the County Courthouse. He would go directly to his
large chamber on the second floor, and relax there
until exactly 8:58, at which time he would don his
long, black robe. On the stroke of nine the door
leading to the bench opened, and he made his appear-
ance. His presence was immediately felt as everyone
rose while the court-crier intoned the opening, “Oh
yeas,” loud and clear.

Now the black-robed man was no longer a timid
old man whose wife dictated his every move. As
though a Fairy Godmother had touched him with her
wand, it was now, “Yes, Your Honor; no, Your Hon-
or.” His word was the law and sheriffs, tipstaves,
and clerks hastened to do his bidding. No one dared
to do so much as sneeze without His Honor’s permis-
sion.

“Call the first case,” he bellowed, glancing menac-
ingly at all. Case No. 000 was duly called. “Is Coun-
sel for both sides prepared to proceed? The Court
wants it understood that it will not tolerate any quib-

bling, and we will dispense with the usual prelimin-
aries since this will be a long, tiring four-hour day.”

“Prisoner, look at the jury,” the judge continued.
“Jury, glare at the defendant. In all fairness to the
accused, I must warn his counsel that as he is a can-
didate in the coming election for dog-catcher, his re-
marks should be tempered in the presence of our

many canine-lovers. Is that clear? Very well!”
Precisely at this moment a baby being cuddled in

its mother’s arms burped. The judge glared in the

general direction of the mother and her noisy child,
then stated firmly, “The Court will not tolerate such

outbursts from the spectators. Any further demon-
strations of this sort will result in my having the
court cleared. The Court’s patience has been sorely
tried.”

Thereafter, the usual array of witnesses paraded to
and from the witness stand. At the conclusion of
their testimony, the state and the defense rested their
cases, and the judge began his charge to the jury.

“Ladies and gentlemen of the jury. At this point
it is my duty to instruct you on the law, and at the
same time, briefly review the evidence in this ease.
I might say at the outset that in the Court’s opinion,
the defendant had his finger in the pie. However, I
wish to make it clear—you are not bound to consider
the honest opinions of the Court. You need not con-
sider that a verdict displeasing to the Court will
cause you to be censured and perhaps barred from
any further jury service. However, it might be well
for you to keep such matters in mind in the event you
have any difficulty finding the defendant guilty.
