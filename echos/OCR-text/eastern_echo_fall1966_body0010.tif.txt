Office Personnel — Shown above are the three civilian
employees responsible for the complete operation of the
printing plant. From left to right: Al French, Jr., Print-
ing Instructor; Veto lIavecchia, General Supervisor;
Clarence Kinney (seated at rear desk), Accountant.
These men are not only concerned with a smooth opera-
tional plant but also the vocational training of the the
inmates employed. The duties of the office staff are varied
and complicated. The present office personnel is about
twelve inmates.

Imposing Table — When the type form has been proofed,
corrected, and OK’d, it is ready for printing. It is placed
on the imposing table, commonly referred to as the stone,
which is a cabinet with a smooth cast iron surface on
which type forms are imposed and locked up for the press
or for reproduction proofing. It takes its common name
from the fact that it originally consisted of a large stone
slab set in a wooden frame. A printer who locks up forms
is called a stoneman. Pictured below are stonemen: Kd-
ward Scoleri (left), Frank Matyasevie (right), and Mr.
Al French, Jr. (center), Printing Instructor.
