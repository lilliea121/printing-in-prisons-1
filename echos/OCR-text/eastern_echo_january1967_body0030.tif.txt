- THE BURGLAR

While sitting in a tavern sipping a beer,

Slug decided he had nothing to fear,

From robbing a store known as Gimble’s,
Where are sold such valuables as 10¢ thimbles.

Standing in the alley in the bright moonlight,
Slug never wavered from the imposing sight,

Of the department store and all its wealth;
Loot for the taking through his cunning stealth.

He sealed the wall like a hopped up eat,
Reaching the fire escape he layed down flat,
And told himself he was goddamn slick,
That this building he would easily lick.

Irom atop the roof he viewed the street,

Look at Slug, with the city at his feet.

The bottle on his hip was his courage and reason,
His armour against the chance of treason.

Slug seen a window, opened up wide,
Pulled himself up and dropped inside.
Burglary sure is easy it sure is a snap,
Those jerks who work are full of crap...

The papers next morning carried the story,

Of the watchman finding Slug, crushed and gory.
Tt seems old Slug had made a speedy trip,

Down an elevator shaft—into death’s grip.

SIDE DISH

Our host served a particular meal,
That consisted mainly of eel.

As the guests looked askance,
The cook did a dance,

And proceeded mainly to peel.

WHAT A FRIEND I HAVE IN—JOHN

Good old John, he’s my pal.

He sure saved me when I lost my gal.
Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night,
He makes sure that I’m snug and tight.
Or when I wake up feeling bad,

John turns me into a jolly lad.

My friend Ill always serve.

Because he’s 100% clear nerve.

Once in awhile John gets down,

Take care of that with a trip to town.
Man, Ill say, when you got a friend,
Best to do, is stick with him to the end.

Have to admit, I’ve seen some sights,

From sitting with John most days and nights...
Why, tell you what I’m going to do,

Just invite you over for a little brew,

For I thank the day that I was born,

And got to know, John Barleycorn.

INNOCENCE

Please there Your Honor, didn’t know that gal was
so young,

Why Mister Honor Sir, thought she was all of 21...

All dolled up such as she was and astanding so tall,

It was really her that was for having the ball.

That’s truth Honor Sir the truth, may the earth
swallow—

What now!, What’s that rumbling and sounding so
hollow?

Oh lordy-lordy Your Honor Sir please,
Just look here how I’m a-shaking my knees.
Little girl! Little girl!, tell the Honor the truth!

“Da-da, da-da, dada forsooth!”
