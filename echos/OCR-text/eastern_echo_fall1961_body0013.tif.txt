of prison labor, there is no intervention of outside
parties, the employment of the convicts is in all re-
spects directed by the state, and the products of their
labors are sold on open market for the mutual benefit
of state and prisoner—though the prisoner eects a
very small share.

The shining example of this system has long been
the state prison at Stillwater. Its binder-twine and
farm-machinery plants have enabled it usually to
operate without expense to the taxpayers. Other
states have been fairly successful with this type of
prison labor policy, but there are objections to it:
those of the pressure groups who oppose the compe-
tition of prison-made goods; and the penologists’
objection that this prison-factory system does not
accomplish the reformation and training of the con-
vict. Low-cost production is the main objective in
such a system.

THE STATE-USE SYSTEM

The most rational and hopeful prison labor system
is the state-use, under which articles produced in the
prisons are disposed of only in state-supported insti-
tutions and bureaus. In some twenty-two states it is
mandatory that institutions and bureaus purchase
commodities that meet their needs from the prisons
if such products are manufactured by the prisons.

Pennsylvania is the only state operating an extensive
state-use system which has not adopted the compul-
sory purchase plan. The success of the state-used

system of prison industry depends upon the type of
legislature that creates the system. As the needs of
state institutions and bureaus are almost without
limit, a well integrated and efficient system of prison
industries can best be set up where the will to do so
1S present.

But selfish outside interests and petty grafts nulli-
fy most efforts made to establish an effective compul-
sory state-use system. And even in those states that
provide for mandatory state-use, eternal vigilance is
necessary to see that the state-supported customers
actually make their purchases from the state prisons.
On the average, if the penal and correctional insti-
tutions could supply a tenth of the total publie insti-
tutional purchases in any year, all the able-bodied
inmates could be put to work in productive enter-
prises. Thus a really effective state-use system could
easily solve the problem of prison labor and industry.

PUBLIC WORKS AND WAYS

By the public works and ways system of prison
labor convicts are employed in the construction and
repair of publi streets, highways, and similar public
endeavors. This is the sort of work the average lay-
man usually recommends when he discusses the prob-
lem of convict labor. It is easy to say, with some
degree of feeling: “Put ’em on the
streets and roads. Hard work’s good
for ’em, and the streets always need
fixing.” Many southern counties have
their road gangs, and they are still a
familiar sight in Virginia, North Caro-
lina, and other states. Sometimes the
convicts wear the traditional stripes,
but in some states they have a less loath-
some color combination. Many states are
proud of the amount of public work
accomplished by their convict gangs.
Of course private entrepeneurs oppose
this system: road contractors object to
it as shoe manufacturers object to the
state-use system of supplying shoes to
inmates of state-supported institutions.

Another objection to public works by
convicts is that advanced by Dr. Benja-
min Rush in 1787, when he denounced
it as a public humiliation and secured
repeal of the Pennsylvania law for
working convicts on the highways. If
prisoners are to be thus employed, mea-
sures should be taken against stigma
and personal demoralization by permit-
ting the workers to wear clothing of
their own choice and by reducing to a minimum such
outward signs of custodial restraint as armed guards,
bloodhounds, shackles, and the like. &
