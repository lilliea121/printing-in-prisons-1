MGD 22 Offset Duplicator — The offset press operates
on the rotary principle of making one impression with
each revolution of the cylinder. The printing image is on
a level with the non-printing area. The word offset refers
to the process which transfers an image to paper by
means of three cylinders, instead of two, as in letterpress.
The ink plate prints on a rubber blanket, which offsets
this ink impression to the paper. Instead of assembling
type and plates, it is necessary to assemble photographic
negatives or positives of illustrations and type matter.
Make ready is eliminated in offset printing. The MGD 22
is the larger of our two offset presses.

Multilith 1250-W Offset Duplicator — Shown below is
pressman Donald Reed (background) printing KASTHRN
ECHO on the Multilith 1250-W. The ECHO has been
printed on this machine exclusively for the past three
years. In center foreground is offset stripper, Stanley
Moroz, checking plate for the next run of pages on the
ECHO. The presses are quite versatile, printing light-
weight manifold or onionskin up to cardboard of 1/16”
thickness, at speeds to 9,000 impressions per hour. They
are ideal for quick printing of office and plant forms, in-
ventory sheets, price lists, sales letters, programs, sched-
ules, ete.
