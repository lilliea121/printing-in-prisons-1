Spotlight on the B and TI Department

A well-learned trade, achieved through

on-the-job experience, can be a tremendous

advantage to a man about to be released from prison

by L. J. BIANCONE

The quarterly spotlight is focused on Lt.
Joseph Roach’s Building and Trades Department,
with accent beamed on Mr. ‘‘Mac’s’’ Masonry and
Plastering Detail. Mr. ‘‘Mac’’ happens to be that
amiable gent with the Irish brogue, listed on the
Commonwealth’s payroll as: Arthur McMenamin,
Instructor. To say the least, the job and title fit
him to a trowl ... he actually works with his stu-
dents, as anyone can observe, as he goes from job
to job, scaffold to scaffold about the institution with
trowl in hand.

The ‘‘students’’, as Mr. ‘‘Mac’’ refers to them,
range anywhere from 18 to 50 years of age. They
are broken into small groups, and assigned to various
jobs; and with each group, Mr. ‘‘Mac”’ is careful
not to assign more men than are actually required
to perform the task at hand. As Mr. McMenamin
pointed out, ‘‘These boys sooner or later will be re-
leased and, if they’re going to earn a living plying

their trade, they must be ready to ‘cut it’ on their
own.’’ Hence, ‘‘They are not simply marking
time .. . with exchange of crime techniques as the
main topic of the day,’’ he elaborated. ‘‘These men
live, think, and talk shop ... and of course worry
about their loved ones and their eventual release.’’
They are taught, as they work, the rudiments of the
trade, as well as the fine arts thereof, under the
guiding hand of Mr. ‘‘Mac’’. Upon their eventual
release, the ‘‘journeymen’’ are on their own, under
the protection of organized labor; namely, the CIO-
AFL.

It is interesting to note that one of Mr. Me-
Menamin’s earlier graduates, a former lifer, is a
journeyman card holder and commutes to work daily
in his own ‘‘Thunderbird’’.

This detail is perhaps the most popular in the
prison,—whose ancient buildings are undergoing a
complete overhauling. Their antiquity (some stand-
