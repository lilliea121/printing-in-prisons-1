he began to talk freely and reminisce of his days
as a member of the Eata-Bita-Py tribe. Chester was
a full-blooded half-breed Cree Indian, the son of
that famous Mother McCree. He talked of his days
as a brave in Milwaukee and his capture by a tribe
from Pittsburgh who tried to make him a pirate.
Eventually he escaped and returned to the Indians
in Cleveland. He carried photos of his first teepee
which was covered with toupees. A tear came to his
eye (the good one) when he showed us a photo of
two human skulls. They were the skulls of his
squaw, Girdie Murphy, one of them when she was a
lovely young maiden and the other when she was
a grown woman...... Whaaaaat?????

It was about this time that Wild Bill Itchsock
picked up a little weight in the form of two pounds
of lead in the breadbasket from the smoking Colt
44’s in the hands of Mrs. W. B. Itchsock. She shot
him in the middle of Main Street and Armstrong’s
Livery Stable. This unexpected turn of events un-
nerved the aging Chester who was heard to mumble,
‘‘T need something tall, cool and full of gin.’’ Dillon
turned in a flash and said, ‘‘Dang your hide, Chest-
er, you’re speaking of the woman I love.’’ Chester
stood there as quiet aS a man sneaking out of
church just before the collection, his fingers busily
applying earwax to his retarded moustache. He
snarled at Dillon, saying, ‘‘You’ve always been
lucky, Dillon. You have a wife and cigarette lighter
and they both work.’’ Dillon reddened, turned and
slowly walked out of the Texas Trail. (But we know
trouble is brewing between them, don’t we?) —-_---

It wasn’t until three days later that Wild Bill
took a turn for the nurse---er, I mean, for the
worse. He was buried in Boot Hill (Forest Lawn
wouldn’t accept him then, he was a nobody) along-
side of Hamner, Ennis and Lopata,-they’d been
dead since April. Wild Bill’s grave was a real jewel.
Mrs. W.B. saw to it, she planted 14 earrots
around it.

Leaving Wild Bill planted out on the Hill, we
were drifting back to town and we could hear the
soft strains of music coming from The Texas Trail
Saloon. It was Joe Banana and his music with a
peel. He and his boys were playing a medley of
funeral dirges, entitled, ‘‘ Get down out of the
Belfry, Mother, Curfew shall not Ring Tonight’’
and, ‘‘Take your shoes off Annie, You’re running
through my mind’’.

We knew all the boys in the Band, the Banana
brothers, so we stopped in to say ‘‘hello’”’ to the old
bunch. Ha-Ha, get it? The old bunch - - bananas...
Hea === — you don’t think it’s funny, eh?

We went up to the bar and ordered 5 Up and
Policeman’s Cookies. (5 Up was as close as we
could get to 7 Up in those days and Policeman’s

Eastern Ecuo

Cookies was the fore-runner of the present-day Cop
Cakes (I SAID IT!!!....And I’m glad. . .glad, do
you hear? _ _ Author) (Okay, so you said it, down
boy = = = Editor)

Chester, being in a sad frame of mind borrowed
my gee-tar and started to sing the Cowboy’s lament :

Dear ole’ paint, my hoss, my life,
Somehow, you remind me of my wife.
She left me, ere I hardly knew her,
And rode away in a cloud of manure.

The song angered Dillon, upholder of the fair
sex and women in general. He’d never been known
to hit a woman.... that weighed more than 135 lbs.
All eyes were now on that famous gunslinger, for
they knew, as well as we, that there was bad blood
between Chester and Dillon. It had been years since
Dillon had slapped leather, but now Dillon’s knees
were bending in that famous fighting pose. His feet
were shifting - - -- - slowly, slowly ...to get the sun
at his back. That steely glint came into his slate
erey eyes, his out-stretched fingers were slowly
dropping towards the butts of those famous Colt
44’s..... on a 22 Cal. frame with telescopic sights...
hanging low on his thighs, encased in pure worsted
gabardine holsters.

The crowd gasped and held their breaths when
Dillon’s whiplash voice rang out....And now we
interrupt this exciting program to have a few words
from our announcer.

Mother Murphy’s Matzo Balls! They don’t
erackle....No! hey dont Snap....No! They
don’t Pop!....No! They just lie there soggy and
gummy as all get out.

Let the children throw them about before din-
ner. Upon serving, remove the outer mold and enjoy
that delicious taste treat of 50 years.

Tear off the top of your nearest grocer and
mail it to Mother Murphy’s. I’ll be waiting for
VOU = - and a Matzo Ball to you,too.

Returning to our story we hear:

‘“Chester!!! Heavens to Betsy, don’t sing that
vulger song in my presence, or I’ll give you such
a pinch already. You make me so mad I could spit.’’

ee | grok!

It dawned on those present that Slat Dillon was
through. His old fighting spirit that had carried him
to glory was gone. The man who had faced down or
outdrawn the most vicious desperadoes of the
Kansas Territory and points north and south was
justa shell of his former self.

The next morning as I was filling the half

~ empty whiskey bottles with water, I noticed Dillon

and Kitty slowly riding into the sun, with Doe and
Chester close behind, singing an old Indian love
song....‘‘The Object of my Affection is up at the
House of Correction....’’

If he had only SPIT!!!!
