not fulfill self, hence the individual seeks
a substitutional release in sameness. The
naturalness I spoke of previously is par-
tially erroneous. You see, in an unnatural
environment it is natural to act un-
natural.

It sounds a litle technical, professor. I
don’t quite understand it but one last
question. You have no doubt heard the
word rehabilitation kicked around in re-
gards to our prison system and its in-
mates. What do you think of the mean-
ing of the word as applied to individual
actions?

First, I wish to say that the word is a
misnomer. Rehabilitate means “to restore
to former status.” This makes many per-
sons see the man as he was perhaps 10 or
20 years ago committing the fouldeed for
which he was imprisoned. What we
really mean, in brief, is the restoration of
the man mentally prior to commission of
the crime for which he is being punished.
One method is the eradication of the for-
mer mental stimulus that motivated,
channeling of his thoughts in a destruc-
tive manner. In other words give him a
new set of values and ideas which will re-
place those previously possessed. This is
mainly achieved by academic and psy-
chological therapeutics. The old con-
cept of “restoration through reflection”
in a Solitary atmosphere is as extinct as
the dodo bird. Of course we have had
radical approaches to the problem. One
was the “prefrontal lobotomy” opera-
tions performed a few years ago by many
imminent surgons. This operation was
started on a voluntary basis. However,
lack of volunteers or money soon de-
creased the interest of many doctors.
There were even some persons who ad-
vocated the radical approach of forced
lobotomy operations. This was likened to
Hitler’s mass sterilization idea as a form
of birth control. The democratic minded
individuals soon quashed this mad
approach.

That was quite a spiel, professor. Would
you kinda sum this all up in a message
of your own choosing and words?

Be glad to. It’s been a long time since I
have been able to let off steam minus the
sterile classroom lectures ’m accustomed
to.

The profesor now begins his summational
message to the reporter.

The illnesses that are a part of today’s
prisons are varied and many. They are
an overall composite of the tradition of
atonement for crimes against man by ex-
clusion of the wrongdoer from society.
This idea is older than many of us can
ever imagine. It is rooted in the philos-
ophy that, denied the natural freedom of
communal existence, expiation of a crim-
inal’s past wrong deeds will be accom-
plished, plus a mental regression which,
as you say, is known as rehabilitation.
There are also idealic concepts which
when viewed with the questioning mind,
rips apart the thin veneer of humani-
tarianism and reveals all the hypocrisy
that has been used so artfully and cley-
erly down through the ages. It is trag-
edy in itself to realize that brilliant
minds have prostituted their mentality,
conjuring up elaborate monstrosities of
stone and steel. Man has been enmeshed
in the web of his own mental entrapment
since time immemorial. The 20th century
has not brought about any echange.
Churning madly within this vortex of
beliefs and ideals are the never-ending
struggle for continuance of life as man
has constructed it. The construction
period has produced many marvels of
creation, especially here in the United
States where skyscrapers reach toward
the clouds. And as each decade passes
these monsters of iron and steel seem
destined to touch or surpass the nebulous
region of the atmosphere. Man’s never-
ending search for knowledge and the
physical evidence, as related, are all too
commonplace. However, with such phys-
ical evidence of the human intelligence
before our eyes, the problems of man
have not decreased. Rather the problems

seem to be getting more complex as our
knowledge propels us further into com-

plexity. This infatuation for the tech-
nical have made us overlook the most
important thing in the world.

What is that, professor?

The human animal. Man has expended
so much of his knowledge outside of him-
self that he is foreed to create bigger
monsters in order to destroy the lesser
ones which threatens to engulf him.
