Many lines of eulogy have written their way, across

shove the pages of ECHO in days gone by and these collo-
cations have been laudatory editorials on both in-

mates and Officials of this institution who deserved

fl the praise; and the old adage of the pen being
all mightier than the sword is true in most cases, but
there is a man amongst us whose sword is mightier

than the pen of the most prominent author. This

beyond writer refers to the Sword of Surgery, and the man
is none other than Dr. Armando F. Goracci, Chief

Surgeon here at the Philadelphia State Correctional

th A Institution.

He is not the type of man who soaks up commen- -

dations like a sponge and he may even be irritated

| at finding his name in print because we are certain
Cd that he does not advocate, solicit, nor approve of
any praise in connection with his work; for not long

ago he declined an offer from the editors of Life ma-

gazine who wanted to give him a spread on the pages
