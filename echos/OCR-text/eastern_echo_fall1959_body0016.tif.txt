OF TIME AND TALENTS

It was reported in the FOLSOM OBSERVER,
inmate publication of Folsom State Prison at Rep-
resa, California, that a newly formed Recreation
Advisory Committee held its first meeting on June
16. This committee, the OBSERVER stated, is made
up of persons of the surrounding community who
have a particular interest in the recreational field.
These men give very generously of their time and
talents in an advisory capacity to help enrich and
broaden the recreational program at the California
institution.

A PENAL PRESS MAGAZINE

“TY personally would like very much to have
some publisher bring out a magazine which would
sell on the newsstands and would be sold by sub-
scription. The: contents would consist entirely of
material written by prison inmates. The material
would be paid for.” So stated Erle Stanley Gardner,
well-known American author, in an exchange of let-
ters with Robert Ebersole of Whittier, California.
Mr. Gardner outlined his proposal, telling of the
major obstacle to be faced and suggested its solu-
tion.

“Tf one of the foundations which spends millions
of dollars each year in trying to improve conditions
in this country would finance such a magazine it is
quite possible that the public support would enable
the magazine to break even, if it was properly edited
and properly advertised.”

“Someday I am going to try to sell the idea to
a foundation because I know of no private publisher
who would touch this with a ten-foot pole without
a subsidy. However, I am hoping that one of these
days a foundation will see the very great possibili-
ies inherent in such a venture.”

Mr. Gardner continued, “Inmates would be en-
couraged to talk about the crime problem as seen
from the eyes of the inmate; about prison condi-
tions, about rehabilitation, etc.”

“T believe writing is a wonderful activity for

prison inmates. By writing they have employment
in their spare time, they learn the use of words and
some few of them can develop into writers with
sufficient skill to earn a living. In short, writing is
one of the greatest tools for rehabilitation that I
know anything about.”

Long a proponent of the Penal Press, Mr. Gard-
ner, in proposing this outlet for inmate writers’ ef-
forts, adds an even greater service to those already
performed.

EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO HELP

A vigorous, friendly young man from Memphis,
Tenn., who has been in the Baptist ministry for eight
of his 29 years, Rey. James Wyninegar, superinten-
dent of the St. Louis Rescue Mission, is devoting
much of his time to helping men from the I[li-
nois State Penitentiary at Menard, though his mis-
sion serves 17 institutions in Illinois and Missourt.

“T want to help im any ways lca, shelsayvsea. th
any of the boys would like me to find employment
for them, or just visit with them here, they can write
me and I'll do everything I can.” He is currently
spending every Friday at Menard, visiting with men
who have written him.

Rev. Wyninegar’s mission, a non-denominational
concern which is supported largely by public con-
tributions, is comparatively young but is doing mon-
umental work. In the first 18 months of operation,
he reports, more than 35,000 men have been helped
—all the way from providing a meal to setting up a
home and employment situation.

More institutions such as this are needed to act
as half-way points between penal servitude and re-
habilitation.

A VIEW WITH SENTENCE APPEAL

Recently in Philadelphia, Common Pleas Court
Judge Raymond Pace Alexander urged that defend-
ands in criminal cases be given the right to appeal
sentences as well as to seek new trials.

Judge Alexander recommended this point in a
talk before the Pennsylvania Assn. on Probation,
Parole and Correction, meeting in a mid-city hotel.

He suggested that an appeal from a sentence
