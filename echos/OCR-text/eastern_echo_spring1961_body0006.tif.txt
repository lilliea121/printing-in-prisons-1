On Tuesday, January 10, 1950, a male student from
Franklin and Marshall College invited Marian Louise
Baker for a ride in his car. Shortly after driving into
the surrounding countryside he stopped the car and
choked the girl to death.

That same day, in a large Philadelphia department
store, a well dressed woman was observed stuffing
one, of a pair of gloves, in her purse. She was arrested
but later released without formal charges being
pressed.

Across the country, in a California city, a man set
fire to a church, and before the blaze was extin-
guished, several firemen had received aid for smoke
inhalation, while the church was burned beyond re-
pair. The man responsible was apprehended at the
seene when he was identified by two children.

These three cases are isolated specimens of the type
that have baffled law inforcement agencies for cen-
turies. They are members of the unpredictables; the
compulsion criminals. Those who commit a felony
without motive or volition. They are unable to help
themselves, and their only excuse: ‘‘I had an im-
pulse.”’

Even more perplexed than the police by the
strange behavior of these unpredictables are our
courts. Should they be classified and tried as insane,
and if so, what criterion should be used in their judg-
ing? It is this question of a criterion that has caused
the controversy in our courtrooms for the past one
hundred and sixty years.

One of the earliest recorded attempts at determin-
Ing criminal responsibility was made in an English
court during the trial of Rex vs. Arnold, (Howard
State Trials, 1724) when Justice Tracy ruled that an
accused should not be held responsible for his act if
he were unable to understand the nature and quality
of that act. Or, in his (Judge Tracy) own words, if
he ‘‘does not know what he is doing no more than

a wild beast.”’

In subsequent trials there were attempts to use
psychiatrists as competent witnesses to determine
whether or not there was insanity present in the de-
fendant’s act. But the same problems arose here that
are still present in our courtrooms of today. In the
annals of psychiatry there are few instances where a
man is completely insane. Yet, both the defense and
prosecution attorneys expect the psychiatrist to
answer either yes or no when asked, ‘“‘Is the defend-
ant insane?”’

As Henry Weihofen expressed it in his book, The
Urge to Punish, ‘‘The psychiatrist knows that this is
the crucial question. He knows that it doesn’t ask
merely for a medical opinion. In effect it asks the
doctor to express his judgement as to whether the ac-
cused should be held guilty or not. He knows that if
he says yes, the defendant knew that the act was
wrong, he is saying that he is legally insane and
punishable, although his own opinion actually may
be that the accused is seriously disordered, and that
the act was committed in consequence of the dis-
order. Should he say no? That answer would perhaps
come closer to expressing his true judgment that the
defendant was not mentally responsible for his act,
but, strictiy and literally, it would be untrue. As the
sroup for the Advancement of Psychiatry has said,
‘This leaves the witness with his intellectual honesty
at stake and no escape.’ However he answers, ecross-
examination will reveal that he cannot give any rele-
vant information about the defendant’s condition
without contradicting himself.’’

Four trials stand as milestones in the laws struggle
to reach a final and conclusive ruling on the issue of
eriterion. Hadfield, M’Naghten, Pike and Durham.
None of these men knew each other but they were re-
lated in one way; each one was an unpredictable.
