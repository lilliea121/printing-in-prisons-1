‘‘My ticket. My return ticket was in the wallet
and I’ve got to be in Port Jarvis tonight.’’

“You really do things up rieht, don’t you,”
Nancy said with a twinkle beginning to dance in her
greenish eyes.

‘*You said it. How could anyone be so stupid.
If I thought it would do any good I’d give myself a
good swift kick.’’

“That wouldn’t help,’’ Naney replied and then
laughter bubbled merrily from her lips. |

‘‘You look so embarrassed.”’

‘‘T was and I am,’’ the young man replied.

‘“What’ll you do now?’’ Nancy asked as she
rested her elbow on the table and cupped her chin
in her hand.

“‘T don’t know. Send a wire for money, I
guess.’’

‘*You won’t make it to Port Jarvis tonight if
you wait that long. Suppose you let me help. She
opened her purse and withdrew a check book.

‘‘Y’m not exactly a millionairess,’’ she said,
‘‘But I can help a friend of a friend.’’

‘“No!’’ the young man exclaimed as he shook his
head. ‘‘Put that away. I’ll wire for money.’’

‘*But that will take time,’’ Nancy replied as she
began to fill in the blank check. ‘‘And you just
said a moment ago it was important that you be in
Port Jarvis tonight.’’

“Yes... but... ’’ the young man stammered.
“This . . . this is embarrassing as the devil. I

ask you to lunch and then can’t even take care of
the check.’’

“You intended to, didn’t you?’’ the girl asked
as she tore the check from her book.

‘‘Of course,’’ the young man exclaimed.

Nancy smiled and slid the check across the table.

‘‘Take this,’’ she said. ‘‘It should cover your
plane fare and give you a few extra dollars in case
anything else comes up unexpectedly.’’

The young man hesitated, then picked the check
up and glanced at the figure. ‘‘But...Nanecy..
I mean, Miss Wable. This is a hundred dollars. It’s
too much. The plane fare is only $54.76.’’ As he
spoke, the young man gazed deeply into her eyes.

_ ..It’s ag though he can see my soul, she thought.
She wondered if he could see the fast rhythmic beat-
ing of her heart. ‘‘You said you’ll be back in New
York in three or four weeks,’’ she said. ‘‘You can
repay me then.’’

‘All right, Nan - - I mean, Miss Wable.’’

“You can call me Nancy if you wish,’’ the young
woman smiled and then glanced at her watch. I’ve
got to get back to work,’’ she exclaimed. It’s ’way
after two already.”’

She rose and as they headed for the door the

young man neatly folded the check and placed it
carefully in his pocket.

The traffic had abated slightly and they were
able to walk side by side as they hurried towards the
building housing the Acme Construction Company.

“Youll call when you get back to New York,
won’t you?’’ Naney asked.

‘‘You bet,’’ the young man replied as they en-
tered the building and then hurried towards the wait-
ing elevator. As Nancy stepped inside, the young
man gave her arm a gentle, reassuring squeeze.

‘“You’re nice, Nancy. Real nice.’’

Nancy smiled her good-bye and then the doors
shd shut.

As he hurried from the building the young man
smiled, then pursed his lips and whistled his nameless
tune.

He nimbly crossed the street to the bank on the
corner. Disappearing into its yawning, monied in-
terior, he reappeared moments later counting the
twenty crisp five-dollar bills. As he walked down
the street he pulled a fat, well-filled wallet from his
pocket and placed the hundred with his other money.

Then the young man smiled. He stepped out of
the flowing crowd and went into a drug store. He
walked towards the phone booth, seated himself and
then studied his little black book. He selected a
number, inserted a coin in the phone slot and dialed.
His fingers drummed nervously on the small counter
as he pursed his lips and whistled his nameless tune.

‘““H & R Automotive Parts,’’ a voice said.

‘“May I speak to Miss Allbright? Miss Wilma
Allbright?’’ the young man said.

‘One moment, please,’’ the operator replied.

He heard a loud elicking as an extension was
plugged into an open line.

‘“Miss Allbright speaking.’’

‘‘Miss Allbright, this is Fred Jamison. You
don’t know me but I’m a friend of Claude Rasson.
Yes, that’s right. Worked on a construction job
with him in Belmont, Texas. It took quite a while
but I finally managed to pry your name and address
out of him. I asked Claude if it would be all right
if I called when I got to New York. Sort of intro-
duce myself. I hope you don’t mind,’’ the young
man added anxiously.

‘“No. It’s real nice of you to even bother,’’ Miss
Allbright replied. oe

“Look, Miss Allbright. I realize you’re prob-
ably quite busy right now and I don’t want to take
up too much of your time. I’ve got to be back in
Belmont first thing tomorrow afternoon and I won-
dered whether you’d care to have dinner with me
tonight.”’

Ss Well
replied.

And then the young man smiled.
