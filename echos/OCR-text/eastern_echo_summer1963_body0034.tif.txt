Being cramped for space in_ this
issue [I will just give you a run down
on the outside games that have been
played to date. On April 28, 1963 a
group of young school boys known as
the Penn Lynn All-Stars arrived on the
scene and they immediately took on the
task of really whitewashing the E.S.P.
All-Stars by the score of 76-40. The
Penn Lynn team, led by 14 year old
Perry, did a masterful job of ball hand-
ling. Perry's dribbling had the ESP
boys in trouble throughout the game.
He was the play maker while scoring
only two points himself.

On May 25, 1963 the Dragons from
Drexel Institute stormed the doors of
E.S.P. with only four players. As it
turned out that was all they needed.
But after a conference with “‘Smiley”’
the E.S.P. team coach he agreed to lend
the Dragons Curley and Shep. | think
this was the first time they played on a
winning team. The Dragons led by
Young Ronnie Forys (Lt. Forys son)
started right with the first call of play
ball to go to work on the E.S.P. All-
Stars. The Dragons had three players
6'4”" and over and one 5’9”’ playmaker
who could dribble you out of your
mind. This was a good game and the
bovs enjoyed it very much and prom-
ised to come back again with all their
players.

I have been advised that “‘Smiley”’
Knowles and “‘No No’ Smith are the
giants of the Quoit courts. Following
close behind are Bob Parett, John
Belvin, John Blanton and Pete Backus.
You can always find some excellent
games going on as you tour the yard.
I understand that Sam Graham is quite
an “‘Artist’’ at the game also. They
tell me that when he has his pitching
arm and eye under control he has
cooled the games of many players at a
given time. If there are any doubts in
the minds of any readers here as to the
greatness of “No No” and “‘Smiley’” as
the Champions, take a chance some-
time and play them a game.
