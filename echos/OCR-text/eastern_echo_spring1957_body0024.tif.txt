ent average indicates. Like all the managers in the
league, Woody is a playing manager and the fourth
highest scorer in the league. Earl Bown, an all-
around athlete, is the third man voted to represent
the Dons on the All-Star team. Another repre-
sentative of the Dons, Paul Joseph Neal, could be
one of the top scorers in the league if his play was a
little more aggressive; he knows the game and how
to handle the ball. Good on defense, his offensive
play could determine the club’s final record.

How the team looks to me:

Woody, Mgr. — Hustler

Harold Berry — Stick-out man

John Collins — Team man

Paul J. Neal — lay-up

Frank McCann — Floorman

Mack — Hustler

John Grandy — Ball Handler

Earl Brown — Team man

Curley — Rebounder
THE RAMBLERS

Second only to Reliable A. C. in having men
represented in the ten leading scorers, the Ramblers
settled for third place. Albert ‘‘Shep’’ Sheppard
led the team in scoring with a total of 165 points.
Managed by Smiley Knowles, an all-around play-
maker, the team looked great offensively, but their
defensive play lost them too many games. They
have the talent to lay them up and in, but could not
master the defensive patterns. Frank Armstrong
and Dave Johnson, with their hustling type of play,
helped the Ramblers.

How the team looks to me:

Robert Watson — Playmaker
Crusty Johnson — Hustler
Harry ‘‘Juice’’ Cohen— Shooter
Joe ‘‘Smiley”’

Knowles — Hooker
Frank Armstrong — Rebounder
Albert Sheppard — Stick-out
David Johnson — Hustler

THE LIONS

Peppery Leo Gillis is striving to manage his
club out of the cellar, but without an injection of
new material soon, his hopes look mighty dim. For
his size, Leo is in his own right a surprisingly apt
player ; his speed is not news, but to see him handling

the ball with the big men is really something to
watch. Captained by Boots, the Lions have plenty
of fire and with Bogardus chosen Rookie of the
Year, they are giving the rest of the league an
interesting time. Another mainstay of the Lions,
Eddie Whalen, still contributes his usual agegres-
siveness to make things a bit tougher, for whomever
they play. Gillis has plans to build his squad into
a more compact unit, depending largely on the
scoring potential of Bogardus and the know-how
of Boots to get the most out of what he has now.

How the team looks to me:

Leo Gillis, Mer. — Floor man

Boots, Capt. — Dead eye
Bogardus — Rookie of the Year
Eddie Whalen — Heady Player
Chick Heifet — Hustler

Skee — Semi-pro

Palmer — Set-Shot
McGrogan — Set-Shot

Trish — Actor

Boothill — Hustler

BASKETBALL ALL-STAR TEAM

The Basketball All-Star Team could not have
been chosen without the aid of my Ace Reporter,
Rob Watson, and I wish at this time to express my
appreciation to him. Rob, as all who are familiar
with him know, is a fiery competitor in all fields of
sports. A one time Welterweight Champ of Holmes-
burg and with enough spark left in him to make
a berth as Fullback on the All-Star Football team
this season—nice going Champ.
