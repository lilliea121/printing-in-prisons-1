Having watched the third place Lynxs in action on
many occasions I’ve drawn my own conclusion to
their down fall of not being a far better ball team
than is said about them. On paper they have the
tools and material to make a better run for the top
slot in their league. With runs to spare they crumble
and go to pieces like leaves in the wind. Dupree
their owner and player has what it takes to win.
Somehow the team doesn’t function as a solid unit
in order to convince him of the greatness of his team.
He has a good hustling team, first they must find
themselves in order to win these close games which
they have blowned in the first half. Perhaps they
have seen their dire mistakes and will pull themselves
together in the second half and become a rated con-
tender. In “Herb” a fine competitor and defensive
player, Jason a darn good pitcher, as well as a fine
stick man, Joe Smiley, a hustler at all times and
gets his hits to boot; and Dupree, a go ‘‘get em’’ type
player who never ceases to perk up his team when
they begin to founder around or boot a few afield.
Once these cats get on the ball, and put their every
effort into it, they'll be mighty hard to stop. I’m
predicting a better brand of ball to be executed by
the Lynx’s during this final half of the season. I'd
not be surprised if they win the second half. After
listening to their first baseman Beauty about the
the Lynx’s chances of winning the pennant, he re-
marked, “‘Baby, it’s all sewed up and put it in print.”

Happy hunting Lynxs.

The last place red birds were encamped in the
cellar during the first half and were a lowly lot never
even getting off in flight to challenge the top
three teams. All of this has changed in the second
half, now they have righted themselves and are a-
wing and playing good steady ball. Their pitcher
Johnny Downs, predicts the Cards will win the sec-
ond half, then cop the championship in the league.
So far the Red Bircls are looking good. They have
acquired additional strength through trades from the
other three teams with such players as, Archey, Go-
dala and Shaffer to bolster their infield on defense,
plus, their attack at the plate. With the fine pitching
of Johnny on the mound they could wing on to the
championship. Time and patience is the factor right
now for this hot tempered ball club.

Their owner, ‘Bottle Neck,’ just cools himself on
his present top perch and gives his team the needed
advice to win... and keep on winning.

The Mets, the original club is no longer in exist-
ence after Mac, its owner left the scene. Another
team has taken over as the “Midget Mets,” and its
present owner is Brownie who has a great deal of re-
building to do in order to bring this team up to par
and to be a threat within itself. Right now it looks
like a dismal and hopeless attempt. It could be done
once Brownie knows what the club is lacking in ma-
terial and tools of war.

Looking through his team’s roster | see no real
‘thunder’, so to speak. He'll need stickmen as well
as glove men in order to keep the other clubs from
blasting the Midget Mets out of the league. So far
they are in the cellar and probably will stay there
for the duration of the season. The Rangers, Cards
and Lynx’s are well fortified with the better players
in the loop.

A few good trades would help the Mets if Brownie

‘has the insight to try, at least. Sometimes a good

trade is difficult, especially when the trading bait
says nothing. He has in Trigger, Bernard, Earley
and Marshall four up to par players. I’m hoping the
Mets fight hard all the way. Keep fighting team.
