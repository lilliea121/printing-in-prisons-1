ical viewpoint on this and time in general:

“The social aspects of a man in prison are of
great value because he must adopt a new way of
thinking in order to meet society’s social standards.
If he cannot replace bad habits with good ones, and
destructive thoughts with constructive ones, then
he is only headed for a downfall and eventual re-
turn to prison. Repetition is good in the prison sense
of sociology in that it enables the man to indoctrin-
ate himself with a decent set of idyllic thoughts
which will be so ingrained in him that they will be
almost commonplace upon his return to society.”

Snoopy became indignant a couple of evenings
ago. John Alexander got carried away and ap-
proached him to try to make a “Bookie” out of him.

Johnnie wanted a hundred dollars covered that he
would commit mayhem on the umpire if he threw
him out of the game—out he went.

Snoopy eased down on Coates’ dining-room the
other day and found a rare substance to slake his
appetite. Mr. Coates’ wasn’t there at the time, so
Snoopy dug in and took the works. The oddity of
the lft was that the treat was never missed.

Lem Harris and Art Couts grabbed Snoopy in
the Typewriter Repair Shop not too long ago, and
demanded an investigation. Snoopy wanted the
facts. Mr. Harris was quick to speak up: There
must be a slasher around, because every typewriter
we get is bleeding. Snoopy winked, and promised to
send some first-aid bandages around.

It was the last half of the tenth inning, and the
score was tied 2—2. A hush fell over the spectators,
Snoopy included, as mighty Joe Rut ambled up to
the plate to face the Cedarbrooks pitcher who had

had been throwing fire-balls past our boys all after-
noon.

The suspense built up to even a greater pitch
when Manager Haywood McCaison was overheard
giving his instructions to our erstwhile pinch-hitter.

“SOG, LEC WYO WoO tment jollaie ame! Gig tia, We wot
the fastest man in the institution on first base. Frank
Ray can move all the way around them base paths
if you can deliver for us. Now forget all about this
pitcher’s speed. I want you to swing at anything
he throws, no matter where it is, got me? O.K.,
here’s where you come in, so listen carefully. Don’t,
I say don’t whatever you do, hit that ball! Miss it
ly? B) UOMO Ore a) wenecl® It dom Caice, Huis wee wae lowe
out in front of their catcher so Ray can have time
to steal those bases.”

Snoopy chewed his tail down to a stub watch-
ing the strategy develop.

On the pitcher’s first offering, Joe cut out in a
wide are, burning up space like a satellite re-enter-
ing the atmosphere. The opposing pitcher blinked
his eyes, and Ray was standing on second. The next
pitch came whizzing in, and Joe slashed out again,
missing the orb by inches, accompanied by Hay-

ace Y

wood’s groan. Ray—in a cloud of dust—came slid-
ing into third, beating the catcher’s throw by a
breath.

Haywood’s strategy proved its worth on the
next pitch. The outside pitcher wound up and threw
the ball far over the head of “Our Hero” Joe Rut
for a wild pitch, permitting Frank Ray to waltz
home with the winning run.

Snoopy took a nip at Manager Haywood for
his after the game remark: ‘“Wouldn’t it have been
horrible if Joe Rut had hit that ball?”

Snoopy lamented with Editor Mike Smith over
his poor timing and ill luck.

Beeause of an old case of hepatitis, Mike could
not, however much he desired, donate his blood.
But on the Bloodmobile’s last stop-over Mike was
accepted. Willingly he left the red stuff gurele out
of him, dreaming all the while of the good strong
coffee and sugar donuts he’d soon be munching on.

It should be noted here that Mike has been a
donut addict all his life. Alas, our Editor waited
till after lunch and was informed while rolling down

_his valiant sleeve, that the donuts had run out in

the A.M.
It is definitely not true that Mike tried to get
his pint back.
