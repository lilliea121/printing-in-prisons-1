The Cuban League

Continued from Page 25

The loss of the first game of the season didn’t
faze the Rams’ confidence. They beat the Falcons
the next two games, taking the weekly series.

During the week of June 23, the Dodgers, full
of vinegar after taking two out of three from the
Giants, took three straight from the Rams. The
Giants then trounced the Falcons three times run-
ning. The following week, the Rams downed the
Giants three in a row and the Falcons upset the Dod-
gers in three straight games.

Before the Cuban League campaign began, the

Falcons’ owner: felt pretty sure that this was his
team’s year.

But, as of this date, and with the Falcons buried
deep in the cellar, he is telling his team-mates to
keep trying, “and if we can’t make the top, we can
continue to act as spoilers against the leading
teams.”

It was once thought that the Falcon’s greatest
weakness was in their field-generalship, managing
and pitching. But now, having obtained John Gil-
more aS Manager, electing James Fisher as Field-
Captain, and signing George Kalvitis and Lonnie
“Rooster” Matthews, two of the best pitchers in the
institution, the Falcons are still not a consistent,
winning team. Their real weakness—poor hitting
—remains the same with the team average now at
226;

Harry Cohen and his Dodgers feel pretty sure
of themselves. At this date they are leading the
league by 34 games.

According to Wheeler, the “Bums” are so good
that, Mr. Graham should disband the Varsity team
and let the Dodgers play the outside competition—
pretty egotistical, heh!

With Bobby Johnson behind the plate, Fred
“Runt” Jordan on the mound, Joe “Buzzard” Sad-
dler on 1b, Billy Hallowell— a first-class ballplayer
—on 2nd, “The Youngster”, John Wheeler that is,
in shortstop, Cohen holding down 8rd, James R.
McCarthy Smith in left, Curly Heath in center, Bill
Mumford in right and Big Keith in short-field; it is
a tough combination to beat. But not invincible.
George Tucker, Team Captain and Willie Wilson,
and Hubert McNeil are in reserve on the bench.

The Rams are in second place because they have
been able to beat the Giants and Falcons at will, but,
haven’t won a game from the Dodgers.

The “Hardheads” are mostly former baseball
players. Manager Dave Croxton, Captain Earl
Brown, James Mays, Joe Champ, Big Mack, W. Per-
ry, George O’Brien, Dave Wilder, Philip Locke, Al-
bert LaRue, Bill Conrey, John DeFelice, Robert
MeNeair and B. Holmes are all over thirty and have
been playing some type of ball for a number of
years, being fairly good athletes.

EASTERN ECHO

Individually their executions might not be too
timely but, as a team, they have enough know-how
to profit from other team’s mistakes.

The Giants are just about holding their own.
They are playing .500 ball, 7-7, but are not expected
to go anywhere. Their outstanding feat of the sea-
son is taking 5 out of 5 from the Falcons.

William Harvey, owner and manager, feels that
after signing Jacob R. Buck, an infielder and Leon-
ard Mahoffey, a windmill pitcher to go along with
the improved play of Joseph Simmon, Norman Pear-
son, Moses Taylor, Elwood Thompson, William
Baity, Charles Swift, Charles E. Whiting, William
O. Jones, Levi Jones, Bernard Allen and Karl Thorn-
ton, the team’s problem should be solved.

THE VISITING ROOM

The absence of heavy screens or plate glass partitions with
speaking tubes, delicious and plentiful box lunches at a nom-
inal fee, a sole polite and considerate supervising officer, com-
fortable stuffed wicker furniture in a light, airy and completely
relaxed atmosphere; this is the visiting room at Terre Haute.

Many men can recall instances while in other institutions
or county jails when a visit was far from a happy cccasion be-
cause of the difficulty in being heard, in some cases seen—due
tc heavy grills, tiny partitioned cubicles, congestion, etc.—and
usually unnecessary hardships afforded their visitors. Unfor-
tunately, institutions do exist that while not actually discourag-
ing visits, do merely go through the motions of tolerating them.

It has long been known to progressive penologists that a
great moralizing facter to a man in confinement is the oppor-
tunity of visiting with his loved ones in relaxed and pleasant
surrcundings. However brief the visits might seem to the in-
mate, his next few days are happy ones when he recalls the
welccme diversion from the otherwise drab routine of everyday
prison life.

A visit is contact with the outside world; it’s a sign of
affection; that someone cares enough to make the oftentimes
troublesome journey to the institution. A visit tells him that he
is no longer alone—alone in a world of hopes; dreams and
anxieties.

EDITORS NOTE: The plans for a new visiting room here at
ESP are in the making. Why not incorporate some of the ideas
of Terre Haute, Indiana, into them. Sounds good.
