RIGHT: A view of the im-
proved athletic field as seen
from a point overlooking the
area. Additional space made
available by the demolition of
the old Machine Shop (see
page 9), which was situated
in the right-field section and
occupied approximately one-
fifth of the playing area, en-
larged the field to one of
near-regulation size for soft-
ball or football, depending
upon the season.

added duties of Official Scorekeeper, is to be con-
geratulated for the fine job he has done. A vote of
thanks also to the three blind... I mean the three
Umpires, Haywood, Mickey and Dan, for the splen-
did job they did throughout the First Half.

Good Luck to “Big Jim” Ford, who now resides
in greener pastures.

The Cuban League

by JOSKEPH McNEAIR

It was brought to my attention that my last
report on the league was incomplete. For the bene-
fit of our outside subscribers, it was thought that I
should have explained why the managers of the
league were forced to stand idly by and watch the
newly arrived softball talent go to the Store-House
League.

In explanation: Before spring, the construc-
tion workers started demolishing the old machine
shop, which took up a large portion of the playing
field, and—when softball spring-training was to start
on April 1st—debris covered the recreation yard,
giving it the appearance of a permanent junk-yard.

A lot of the fellows who had been around a
while, doubting the possibility of the league opening
in 1958, went to the Storehouse, sometimes known as
the Rookie League. And as usual, the new fellows,
anxious to prove what they can do, followed.

On the evening of June 16, 1958, in spite of
doubting Thomases and impatient little boys, the
Rams and Faleons played—opening the 1958 Sea-
son.

EASTERN ECHO

Superintendent William J. Banmiller threw out
the first ball.

The opener was a thriller; a scoreless game until
the Falcons scored a run in the bottom of the fifth.
The Rams tallied the tying run in the top of the
sixth. The Falcon’s catcher missed a third strike
and Little MceNear beat the throw and then stole
second. The next two batters for the Rams popped
out. With two out and a man on second, “Pigmeat”
Perry hit a ringing double, scoring the man from
second to tie the game. The next batter went down
swinging to end the inning.

The Rams went down in order in the top of the
seventh. In the Birds’ half of the seventh, the first
man up rolled out to short. Next up, John Alex-
ander drew a walk, stole second and went to third
when Selby reached first on an error by the first
baseman. With one out, men on Ist and 3rd, John
“Jack the Bear’ Walker stepped up and punched
a single between first and second, scoring Alexander
with the winning run.
