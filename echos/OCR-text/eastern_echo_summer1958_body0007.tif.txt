to sell papers. That is their job. But, how do
they feel as individuals? Let us look into the feel-
ings of Mr. Charlies Shaw, News Director, Station
WCAU, Phila., Pa. Mr. Shaw, who has been in the
newspaper field for over 25 years, had this to say
when addressing the Middle Atlantic States Con-
ference On Crime and Delinquency, at Atlantic City,
Nadi. si Miley Ia

‘‘The whole system of probation, parole and
pardon is threatened—to what degree I don’t know—
by the publie’s failure to realize, and by the farlure
of the media to inform them that the vast majority
of parolees in Pennsylvania, never get into trouble
once they are released from confinement. The small
minority that do get into trouble make the headlines.’’

Later in his address, he emphasized—‘The
trouble is that the general public doesn’t hear—ecan’t
hear—about the parolees, the other ex-convicts who
have made good.’’ He goes on to cite men who have
become pillars of society, but who had served time
in the Penitentiary. Mr. Shaw presented the reason
you are mo aware of these men: But “they
(Parolees) are not going to come forward to say—and
if he can help it, he’s not going to let anybody else
say—that he’s an ex-convict who made good. The
life he has built since his release from prison would
erash into ruins’’.

Gentlemen, this is a sad state of affairs. We
must suffer the results of adverse publicity, but we
cannot profit by the greater percentage of “‘good
parolees’? because such publicity would result in
public crucifixion of their wives and children, as
well as their place in society. Remember, these are
the words spoken by a newspaper man!

You, as part of society, will agree that a man
should be taken out of society if he will not live

according to its rules. Most of us agree with you. .

However, it is your tax money that is helping to
furnish the facilities for our rehabilitation. It 1s
an expensive proposition. And yet, when we attempt
to hand you the dividend in a fu:ly reaabiitated man,
you refuse the product of your own machination.
You reject the man who, in good faith, has accepted
the ultimatum you handed down to him. The ulti-
matum that he must pay his debt and rehabilitate
himself before he can return to society. This just
doesn’t make sense!! By rejecting him what are
you, in effect, doing to your own social structure?
If a man is told that society expects h'm to overcome
his weakness; if he is told that he should strive to
educate and rehabilitate himself; if he is toid that
once he has accomplished this fact he will have proven
himself to be ready to return to society; if he is to:d
that he will be met halfway by the public upon his
return, and these promises are ignored!!
What has society accomplished??? What, in heavens
name, are you trying to do to your own social system ?
Is this the incentive that is being established for an
individual to become a useful and productive citizen ?

Or, are you emulating Dr. Frankenstein, and creating
a product that shall eventually be released to society
with a vengeful, antagonistic attitude?

Those percentages that I gave you a while back.
They were not manufactured by the writer in an
effort to ‘‘Whitewash’’ prisoners because he is one
himself. They are factual records and can be
verified. My concern goes forward to the time when
I, once again, shall be a useful member of society.
I am concerned about the ignorance of facts that is
causing a decline in the structure of society. I am
concerned about you! What is gomg to happen in
the future when thousands upon thousands of men
shall be declared rehabilitated and ready to be ab-
sorbed by society. Your newspapers are crying
about the deplorable situation of ‘‘ Juvenile De-
linquency’’. They are submitting thousands of ideas
as to what to do to reduce the malignancy. One of
the most accepted ideas is to place them in institu-
tions and retrain them so that they will realize the
responsibilities associated with citizenship in our
country. This is a wonderful idea. But, if you
are going to spend the money for this education,
and once he has become aware of his responsibility
and is ready to accept this responsibility, are you
eoing to say ‘‘The hell with him, let someone else
hire him!’’ Who is shirking their responsibilities
as citizens now? Believe me, gentlemen, if you
purposely built an institution for the manufacture
of criminals, you couldn’t have done a better job.
Everytime you classify all prisoners by the action
of one, you are adding fuel to the stokers that give
energy to crime. You are ignoring the basic foun-
dation of the principles upon which our country was
founded. Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
They are becoming hollow and elusive words.

I wish it were possible for each one of you to
come in and visit with us. I wish it were possible
for you to sit and talk to some of the men whom
society, and probably yourself, have labeled ‘‘vi-
cious’’. I would like to hear your remarks and see
your reactions. J have noticed it in others who came
to visit us for the first time. Needless to say, they
are continual visitors and supporters. You ean make
such a visit possible. J am certain that ‘‘would-be’’
employers would be made welcome as visitors. You
ean talk to us and form your own opinions. When
you leave the prison (which, fortunately, you can do)
compare the opinion you hold with the one you held
previously.

From past experiences, we don’t expect much
from society. But then, we are not asking much of
society. We only wished to be judged, individually,
for what we are. Not for what we were. We are
willing to talk of our mistakes in life. We are
anxious to show that we have profited by these mis-
takes. Many of us have fulfilled our obligations to
the state and society. We are willing and ready to
