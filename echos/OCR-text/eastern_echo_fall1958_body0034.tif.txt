A Little Whitenpoot

t happens that I am sitting in Ray’s Bar one night
when who should come walking through the
door but “Sure Thing” Freddy.

Now the last time I see Freddy I am in Florida
trying to make a few bucks at the track. Unfortu-
nately I do not have a winning way and it appears
T will have to make it back to Philadelphia courtesy
of a boxear.

Luckily, as I say, I run into Freddy and he is
touched by my plight to the extent of a tenspot and
the name of a horse which is a sure thing. It is
from his way of prophesying the winner in all man-
ner of contests that Freddy acquires the name “Sure
Thing,” although there are those who would have
you believe that Fred is not above slipping various
people a few bills in order to insure the accuracy of
his prognostications.

However, to get back to the present, as Freddy
comes into Ray’s I can see that he is more than
somewhat in his cups. This is a shocking thing as
I cannot recall anyone seeing him take more than
a beer or two and then only in the way of social
affairs.

Since I am not one to disregard people just be-
cause they are under the weather I give him a big
hello and assist him to the stool next to mine.

vihank you, sure Thine hiecups, - And i
hope you will excuse my present condition.”

“Why that is all right,” I reply. “I myself am
not above getting a good feeling every once in a
while.”

At this Fred shakes his head. “It is not be-
cause I wish to feel good that I imbibe so freely,”
he says. “It is all because of an incident in youth
and I am trying to forget.”

“Well,” I tell Freddy, “I hear it is even money
that if you can get someone to listen to your troubles
they will soon be forgotten. Since I owe you a
favor and I am doing nothing at the present I will
be more than glad to hear you out.”

With that Sure Thing orders two more drinks,
and here is the story as he tells it to me.

_It seems that when Freddy is a youth he does
not have the wisdom he now possesses and in order to
obtain the pocket money necessary for food, shelter,
and playing the numbers, he resorts to such antics
as are frowned upon by the law. Finally, he is
somewhat embarrassed to be found cleaning up a
place of business. The reason for the blushing is
because not only does the store not belong to him,
but it is in the early hours of the morning when he
has absolutely no business whatsoever being in the
establishment.

Not having any connections at the time Freddy
soon finds himself doing five-to-ten in a very high-
walled place in the country. Having no particular
desire to spend any amount of time in a cell, he
promptly starts to make plans to leave by somewhat
illegal means.

As I say, Freddy has no connections and there-
fore no one who can provide clothes or a car for
him, and what with the prison uniform having more
than a fair number of stripes it would not be very
wise thing for him to walk down the street in it.

“So,” Sure Thing continues, “I get hold of an
extra uniform and what with needles and thread, I
start to make me a suit.”

Lacking a pattern to go by, Freddy draws one
of his own. This is not too hard a thing to do as he
seems to have a flair for designing clothes.

Then he proceeds to dye the suit with ink that
