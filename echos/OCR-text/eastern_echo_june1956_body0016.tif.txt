the heavy boots of the conquerors shook the

very walls of his fragile home. As if sharing
his fearful anticipation, the paper-thin walis trem-
bled in terror of the destruction and violence prom-
ised by the strident voices of the occupying troops.
Surely, this was the end of the world; the civilized
world of small courtesies, delicate paintings, and
tinkling, brittle poetry.

All morning soldiers had been passing through
the village, some on foot and others riding in mon-
strous vehicles which seemed to swallow up the
street, until the dust rose behind them to reveal yet
more columns of khaki-clad troops. The ill-fated
war, which had left the tiny village of Moiwashita
unchanged, had ended ten years ago and yet, today,
the fearful farmers saw the enemy for the first time.

Some of the people recalled letters they had re-
ceived from sons who had fought these men in the
jungles of far away islands and saw now that they
were truly a race of giants with ungodly weapons.
Unfortunately, most of the sons had died or refused
to return to the forgotten village after the war, and
so there was no one to whom they could turn for an
answer to their many questions.

Thus they stood in awe and sucked in their
breath at each passing vehicle or column of soldiers.
When the conquerors had first appeared, the elders
of the village had assured everyone that they were
merely passing through, but the children who had
eourageously followed them had returned to report
that they seemed to be stopping right outside the
village.

The day passed rapidly in the excitement of a
once in a lifetime experience and no one had gone to
work in the surrounding rice paddies. After eating
their evening meal, the men gathered in small groups
to discuss the day’s events and the effects it would
have on their lives. All were agreed that no good
could possibly result and that evil was to be
expected.

Suddenly, a rumor swept the village as if driven
by the west wind: the village elder had been taken
by the enemy to talk to their commander. They
had come in one of their little cars and taken him a-
way despite the protests of his family. Having no
other authority to turn to, they questioned each
other as to the possibility of such a rumor having
truth and over many cups of hot sake decided that
such things were to be expected from the ‘‘gaijins.’’
Then with hurried bows they left each other to re-
turn to their homes and inform their families of this
unspeakable breach of propriety which had been
perpetrated during the warm summer evening.

At the temporary camp erected by the troops of
the 2nd Cavalry Regiment, a meeting of nations was
being held in the large pyramidal tent which served
as the regimental CP. ‘With the aid of a Nisei in-
terpreter, Lt. Colonel Cathart was trying to explain
to the aged Japanese standing in obeisance in front
of him that he meant no harm.

“‘Liook, corporal,’’ he sighed in exasperation.
‘‘Can’t you get a few simple facts across to him?
Just explain that we’re on maneuvers. We’re going
to be here for a month. The United States govern-

ment will pay for the use of his land. We’re not
going to rape his women or burn down his paper
shacks. By the expression on his face, you’d think
I had just spit in the Emperor’s face.”

The corporal spoke rapidly for a few minutes
during which the Japanese did not make any sign of
understanding but continued to stare morosely at
his clasped hands. Finally, the interpreter said,
‘‘T’m sure he understands, sir. It’s just that he’s
afraid of us. These people are ignorant farmers
and they’ve never seen a white man before. Imag-
ine the reaction if you were to bring a troop of
Japanese into some of the back country of Georgia
or Kentucky.’’

Cathart grunted and answered, ‘‘I don’t need a
lecture on racial identification, corporal. Just so he
understands. Before he goes you’d better give him
the bad news. No use putting it off. We’re going
to need eight or nine of his shacks for the more per-
manent installations. We don’t have enough tents
for the aid station, radio, and so on. Better tell him
now.”’

“You mean their homes, sir?’’ asked the inter-
preter in astonishment. ‘‘Why, there are only about
twenty-five houses in the whole village. And there
must be six to eight people in each house. I don’t
see how they can do it, sir!”

The colonel jumped to his feet and shouted,
‘‘Damn it, Lee, am I in command of this regiment or
are you? Maybe you think you should have some
loyalty to these people, but you’re still a member of
the United States Army. Remember that! They
can crowd together a little more; they’re used to it.
They’ll be paid for it the same as the land. Now
tell him! That’s an order. I’ll personally go to the
village in the morning to pick out the ones I want.”’

‘“Yes, sir,’’ answered the corporal and without
further argument repeated the colonel’s instruc-
tions to the Japanese.

The next morning the villagers lined the street
expectantly as the colonel’s jeep appeared and
stopped in the center of the small cluster of build-
ings. The intended appropriation of their homes
had been discussed at length but they only succeeded
in strengthening their belief that resistance or pro-
