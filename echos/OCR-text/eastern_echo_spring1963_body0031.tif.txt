The underrated Wildcats came on
like a “‘gusher’’ to cap the Champion-
ship from the highly rated Cobras. A
great lesson was given by the Wildcats
with the great quarterbacking of Tom-
my Griffin, the M.V.P. in the Eastern
Football League. No team is able to
apply its tools of the trade unless it
possesses a capable and flexible quar-

their games and won, going away. It
was the moxie of Griffin that brought
his club from behind and showed the
opposition that a darn good quarter-
back is like money in the bank. The
ultimate downfall of the Cobras was
their lack of cohesion within their
squad to function as a solid unit. In
Joe Click, you have a veteran quarter-
back who has played the game for
many years—but his great talent is
void, especially when the players under
his astute generalship don’t come up to
his great expectations. This definitely
hurts the entire progress of his team,
in fact, any squad.

In order for team personnel to move
on the field they must first become lis-

teners, and not rabid talkers as were
the Cobras, when they began their as-
sault upon their opposition. In other
words, everybody wanted to give the
quarterback advice on what to do on
the next play. This hurt the morale
of the club and caused its ultimate de-
feat at the hands of Tommy Griffin,
who knew of this dissension and took
good advantage of it. Like... how
smart can you be.

The game was hard fought, for the
players knew the Championship was
at stake and thus put forth their every
effort to win and without too many
blunders. ‘“‘Joe Click’” and Tommy
Griffin, were pitted against each other
in leading their teams to a solid and
convincing victory, if humanly possible.
A break here or there could mean the
contest for either team. The Wildcats
got their first break from the hands
of the Cobras’ All-American center.

Hold on sport’s fans, and hold on tight.
I bet you have no idea at all who it
was? It was none other than Rob
(Fumble) Watson, who made it known
to everyone that his presence would
end in his team’s defeat by the clumsy
handling of the ball from his position
as center. The Wildcats, sensing Rob’s
inability as center, made him commit
himself by faking their attack towards
him, and, true to his name, the tide
changed because he did not read the
exact count from “Joe Click.” In the
second period, a fumble from center
gave the Wildcats their first scoring
opportunity. And score, they did. The
tenacious Tommy Griffin took his team
from mid-field to the five yard line
from where he faked a pass to Blacky
Battles, then wisely went off tackle for
the first score. The conversion was
missed and now the Cobras knew their
work was cut out for them after that

T.D.

Joe Click tried his utmost to inject
new life into his players—they came on
strong in the final stages of the first
half—but the Wildcats front wall
staged off any threats the Cobras may
have had, with the likes of “Big
Swede,” “Stopper” Cromwell, Chuck
Johnston, and Dick Cantellion. Back-
ing up the line of dreadnaughts, were
Blacky Battles, Pinky Andrews, “‘Dyna-
mite’’ Valley, and their capable leader,
Tommy “‘Frantic’’ Griffin. One is able
to conceive the obstacles the fouled-up
Cobras had to overcome.

In the second half, the Wildcats re-

‘ceived possession at this stage of the

battle meant everything to the team
that controlled the ball. The Cobras
looked very good in the third period.
“Click” had his club moving and in a
position to score on the Wildcats’
