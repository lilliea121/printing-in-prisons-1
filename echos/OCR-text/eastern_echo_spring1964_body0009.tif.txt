eliminated the probability of a broken home for him.
He will be a good parole risk, because he has already
adjusted to his job and he will not be penniless when
he leaves prison. Most of all, Jessie Ennis has been
allowed to retain his self-respect and his human dig-
nity, while being permitted to support himself and his
family. He has built up confidence that he can con-
tinue to legitimately support them upon release. The
case of Jessie Ennis serves as an illustration of what |
think rehabilitation should accomplish.

THE OFFENDER’S FAMILY

Is that punishment a just punishment which pun-
ishes the innocent as well as the guilty?

The answer to this question is not as simple as it
might seem. Whenever the subject of the suffering
and hardships of the imprisoned offender's family is
raised, the standard, pat answer is a reference to the
family of the victim. Has anyone ever known two
wrongs that equalled a right?

The imprisoned offender's family is a very distress-
ing problem, for obviously they are guilty of no
crime, yet they suffer financial problems and psycho-
logical problems of even more eminent consequence.
If the imprisoned offender is the bread winner, then
the problem of the family becomes acute. Either the
wife has to go out of the home and find work or the
Commonwealth, through relief, is further penalized.
Neither the former nor the latter situations are
healthy. Where the wife is forced to go out of the
home in order to earn a living, the children, invari-
ably, suffer and the family is usually forced farther
apart. When the Commonwealth takes over the re-
sponsibility of providing for the family of the con-
victed offender, it places a double penalty on itself,
for it must keep both the offender and his family—a
very unhealthy situation as the experience of the Wel-
fare Department, with three generation welfare fam-
ilies, will attest. The Commonwealth should have no
desire to promote welfare as a way of life.

Under the Work Release Program, the offender
and his family can retain their dignity. The offender
who qualifies would assume the rightful burden of his
own and his family’s support. This fact, that the
offender has been allowed the privilege of support-
ing his family, will go a long way toward keeping the
family unit stable during his imprisonment. Society
must be willing to recognize its responsibility to the
offender's family

THE PENAL REVOLUTION

And tt shall come to pass that when they
make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and
when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all
the people shall shout; and the wall of the
city shall fall down flat, and the people
shall ascend wp every man straight before
him.

JOSHUA, 6:5

All over the world an unsung revolution in peno-
logy is quietly, but swiftly, taking place.

SWEDEN: The Swedes, longtime leaders in modern
penology, have designed a factory to produce pre-
fabricated houses in prison. The factory-prison will
employ 120 prisoners. They will be paid regular
industrial wages of approximately $1400 to $2000
annually. Deductions will be made for taxes, room
and board and a regular allowance for the support of
their families. It is hoped that an air of freedom can
be created inside the prison. Prisoners will be allowed
week-end passes to visit their families. In Sweden
seventy-five per cent of convicted persons are serving
out their sentences on one type of probation or
another.

GREAT BRITAIN: British penologists have intro-
duced a plan under which preventive detainees in
several prisons are serving the last nine months of
their sentences in semi-freedom. The prisoners are
permitted to work at regular jobs in civilian industry,
reside in a hostel and go about on their own in the
evening. The regular wages earned give them an
opportunity to accumulate a small savings account,
which will enable them to get off on the proper foot
when released.

All inmates, serving two years or more, may earn
a remission of one-third of their sentences by keeping
an exemplary conduct rating throughout the duration
of their confinement. They may also be permitted five
days leave during the four months prior to their re-
lease, for the purpose of contacting possible employ-
ers, arrange domestic problems and to generally re-
store self-confidence.

While North Carolina is credited with pioneering
this type of rehabilitation, variants of the Work Re-
lease Program are in use in nine other states and
many more states are investigating its potential.
