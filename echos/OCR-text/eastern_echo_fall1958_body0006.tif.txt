|” addition to the measurable length of depriv-
ation of liberty, a jail sentence carries with it a
more subtle punishment. A punishment. not or-
dained by any judge or jury, nor set forth by any
statute. A delayed action type of punishment of
which the convicted person is usually completely
unaware until he has completed his sentence or been
discharged on parole. Only after he leaves the
prison and the sheltering influence of its abnormal
socicty, does he discover that he has become a mem-
ber of an artificially created minority group—‘ex-
eon.” Like the member of any other minority
group he has lost his right to be judged as an in-
dividual and is automatically burdened by society’s
stern evaluation of the group as a whole.

The artificiality of this minority group lies in
its birth—unlike other such groups, membership is
not derived by a status of birth such as nationality,
race, or religion, but by an experience—serving
time. This fact makes the “slings and arrows” di-
rected at the group all the more painful. A Negro,
a Jew, or any member of other like groups have
lived with their status since childhood and have, in
most cases, developed an instinctive defense which
makes them less vulnerable to the attacks upon their

individual. In some eases, this is encountered even
in the prison despite the fact that there he is in the
majority. How many times in his contacts with
various officials has the inmate been treated like
a eretin, his self-regard lessened by the attitude
“Yowre just an inmate, what do you know about
anything?”

How many times will an inmate who has en-
countered such stupid self-satisfaction attempt to
break through this barrier before he ’wises up” to
his new position in life and retreats from any fur-
ther such contacts, putting aside any further efforts
to be an individual until the day of his release from
prison.

On the day of release, the inmate joyfully sheds
the uniform which broadeasts his status as a pris-
oner. He dons the clothes of the civilian and “hits
the street” to breathe the clean, fresh air as a free
and equal member of society. Perhaps he is on
parole in which case he realizes he must abide by
certain rules and regulations which will restrict
him somewhat more than is his fellow-man. In most
instances he is content to live within the bounds of
such rules for he has regained a sense of identity,
