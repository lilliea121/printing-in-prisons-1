In the middle of last month, a hot argument broke
out between two fellows in the yard. The fracas
soon spread to half the inmates within the vicinity of
the debate. The bone of contention was not baseball
or girlfriends or even parole, but the Benny Good-
man and Artie Shaw bands and one man declared
Goodman had been the best. The other man wasn't
having any of that. As ill will spread, the belliger-
ants formed themselves into small cliques; one group
shouted that neither Shaw nor Goodman, but Tom-
my Dorsey had been “the greatest; another de-
clared for Bob Crosby; still another for Glenn Miller.
The verbal warfare continued on through the eve-
ning, to be silenced only by the whistle that signaled
us back to our cells.

Similar incidents, such as this one, have occurred
a thousand times over during the past 25 years, be-
ginning back in the days when the big bands played
swing. It was a part of Jazz history. A time that Jazz
writers call ‘“‘the swing era,” the period of greatest
mass popularity that any Jazz style has ever had.

The accounts usually say that everything started
in March 1937, when the Benny Goodman band
played an engagement at the Paramount Theatre in
New York. From the moment the musicians came
onstage, there was shouting from the seats, dancing
in the aisles, panic followed by patient submission
from the ushers—and 11,500 paid admissions the
first day.

Of course, a few rumbling voices declared at the
time that this “‘“swing music’’ was not really anything
new; that it was just “another name for Jazz.” The
fact that between 1917 and 1937 Jazz had been
through a major revolution affecting not only the
size of the Jazz orchestra, but the Jazzman’s basic
ideas of rhythm and melody. Among the first con-
tributors was Louis Armstrong—a name well known
—and pianist—leader and arranger Fletcher Hen-
derson and alto saxophonist and arranger Don Red-
man—two whose names are not so well known.

Actually, the swing fans described above were
arguing about very little. There was not really much
difference between the Goodman and Shaw styles.
Goodman had a disciplined brass section and relied
heavily upon it; Shaw’s band was “‘cooler’’ and de-
pended on its highly disciplined sax section. Tommy
Dorsey and Bob Crosby were in the same stream but
from different sources. And as for Glenn Miller,
though his music may have been good dance music,
it is rather hard to take it seriously as Jazz. On the
other hand, two of the great creative big bands of
the late thirties, Duke Ellington’s and Count Basie’s,
didn’t even raise a voice among the teen age devo-
tees of the time.

The roots of big-band swing style go back to the
twenties and the three major figures that shaped it
came together in 1924, when Louis Armstrong
joined Fletcher Henderson's orchestra in New York.
To the laymen, Armstrong’s contribution is perhap
the easiest to recognize. It was he who first affected
the phrasing, the ideas of rhythm and melody—the
Swing—that was to rule music and the style of im-
provising that was to influence every Jazz player, no
matter what his instrument.

But before Armstrong arrived, Redman and Hen-
derson had already given this music a basic frame-
work and style in their orchestrations. Before the
improvising soloist gets to it, swing music belongs to
the composers and arrangers, and the first successful
arranger for big-bands was Redman working for
Henderson's orchestra.

Redman shaped the style of the orchestra. He
saw that the future of Jazz lay with more control
over the group yet more freedom for the individual
soloist. The ‘collective’ improvising of New Or-
leans Jazz seemed to have gone as far as it could.
He took a conventional American dance band of the
time—with its separate sections of saxophones
(doubling on clarinets), trumpets, trombones and
rhythm—and managed to convert it into a new kind
of Jazz band. He even made some use of the dance
bands style, the solo passages had to be Jazz impro-
visions, and the written variations had to be in the
Jazz style. One thing more became distinctive; Red-
man borrowed the ‘call and response’ patterns
heard in Negro church services.

By 1927, Armstrcng had left the Henderson Band
and Redman and Henderson were also going their

Henderson, however, continued to get the solo-
ists. At various times in the twenties and thirties he
had Hawkins, Armstrong and Kaiser Marshall, pian-
