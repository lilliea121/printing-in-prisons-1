In hopeful anticipation of an uninterrupted, relax-
ing movie, I took my place on the hard bench in our
small drafty Chapel. I immediately launched into
my weekly inner debate on what to do with my coat
this week. I could leave it on and keep my body at
a comfortable temperature or place it on my seat
and keep my posterior reasonably comfortable. As
usual, | decided to alternate; keep my body warm
for fifteen minutes and then alleviate the pain be-
neath me for fifteen minutes, and so on. Because
the benches are not gradually elevated from front to
rear, the coat serves a two-fold purpose; when seated
upon it, I could also see the screen. This accom-
plished, I settled back, anxiously awaiting, ““Who
Shot Liberty Val-

lance>”’

The lights went out
and the introduction
flashed on the screen .

and where is_ the
sound? “‘Oh brother,”’
I thought, “here we go
again. The young
man next to me was
rubbing his eyes with
both hands and shak-
his head. “Poor fel-
low,’ I thought, “‘he’s
new, and _ thinks his
eyes have gone wack-
ey.”

“Take it easy, pal,
this happens almost every week. There's nothing
wrong with your eyes,” I assured him.

By now the picture was almost in focus, but where
“Sound up,’ someone hollered.
Others took up the chant, “Sound up, sound up.” It
seemed like everyone was hollering. Finally the
moving lips on the screen uttered words. The words
were barely audible, but as the audience slowly quiet-
ed down, | began to make them out. ‘Oh well,”’ I
thought, “we only missed the first five minutes this
time and that’s better than usual.’’ | suddenly be-
came acutely aware of the hardness beneath me,
shifted a bit, then settled back to enjoy the flick.

screen viewing the remains of a dear departed friend.
Four shots rang out, followed in rapid succession
by a burst seemingly from a machine gun. “Oh this
can't be,” I told myself, “not in a cowboy picture.”
Unable to immediately connect the shots to the pic-
ture, | soon had the mystery solved—the steam
pipes in the Laundry beneath the Chapel were act-
ing up again. I had forgotten them since last winter.
The rapid fire had stopped and now they banged out
a steady tom-tom beat, rendering every third word
of dialogue inaudible. ‘They'll stop soon,’’ | tried
to assure myself. | was really irritated now, but still
hoping for the best. My attention was drawn from
the “‘tom-toms’’ as the picture abruptly jumped—the
bottom half of the
picture was now at the
top half of the screen,
and the top half was
at the bottom of the
screen. The picture
was cut in half hori-
zontally by a_ thick
black line. The audi-
ence began to moan,

the groaning reached
its peak, the picture

was starting to feel chilly now, so I decided it was
time to put my combination “‘coat-cushion’’ on, and
warm up a bit. The “‘tom-toms’’ were gradually sub-
siding now, so | hoped I was set for awhile. It was
wishful thinking. During the next eighty minutes
the following irritating incidents occurred: twice the
picture left the screen completely; five times the
sound went too low to hear; five times the picture
became dark—a night scene in the daytime; and
once the picture was interrupted for about ten min-
utes when the film broke.

Without a doubt every inmate who reads this has
shared my experience at one or more of our movies;
