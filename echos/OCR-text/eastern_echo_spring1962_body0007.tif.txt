In Georgia’s Reidsville prison, a Negro boy, Pres-
ton Cobb Jr., 15, is whiling away days that can’t be
long enough for him.

He is under sentence of death for killing a 70-year-
old white farmer. There have been protests and ap-
peals from all over the world, moving the case from
the obscurity of a rural county in Georgia to the
spotlighted arena of public controversy.

The issue is not over the boy’s guilt. It is over his
age, and the state’s legal capacity to execute a child.
Criticism has focused on laws and legal rulings which
permitted the state to try Cobb as an adult. At the
center of the issue, there is this question: At what
point are youngsters too young to be executed?

In Georgia, by law, the death penalty can be given
to a child as young as 10. Georgia is not alone in this
category.

An Associated Press survey of legal possibilities
in criminal proceedings involving children shows: In
16 states it is legally possible to execute children as
young as 7, in 3 states, death could be given to chil-
dren of 8, in 3, including Georgia, youngsters of 10.

In the remaining 19 states having the death pen-
alty the minimum age ranges from 12 to 18. All 50
states posses the power and authority to try children
as adults—and give them the same punishment as
adults—in cases of capital crimes.

How is this possible in a nation that created the
juvenile court system to give special protection to
children?

Behind this question lies a legal dilemma summed
up in a statement by Dr. Ralph S. Bannay, associate

juvenile offenders is that a child has not reached a
degree of intellectual and emotional development
that would qualify him as fully responsible for his
ACIS.

“The laws, however, embody an obvious contradic-
tion: For when an offense is too obnoxious or re-
pugnant, complete responsibility is placed upon the
child and he must face the full weight of the law.”

In substance, this is the situation in the United
States, today: Despite the protection given children
through the juvenile court systems in which they
cannot be tried as criminals—all states can prosecute
and punish children as though they are adults.

not the scheme of vengeful prosecutors but, ideally
and theoretically another way to give the child the
greater protection of constitutional rights.

The irony is that this legal machinery to protect
children can cut both ways. The machinery is not
rusty by any means. Sometimes it delivers death;
most times prison sentences that in some cases
amount to living death.

At least 70 teen-agers have been executed in the
half century. The youngest was a Negro boy of 14,
George Stinney, Jr., who was electrocuted for murder
June 16, 1944, in South Carolina. Few females of any
age have been put to death, but one was a Negro
girl of 17, Virginia Christian was executed for mur-
der in Virginia’s electric chair August 16, 1912.

Edward Bell was 13 when he was sentenced to a
life term for rape, and James Frank King was sen-
tenced in 1958 to a life‘term for murder, in Florida
a state which has executed four 16-year-olds. Bell
and King are white. King’s sentence has since been
commuted to an indefinite term.
