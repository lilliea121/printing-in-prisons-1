retary, “Miss Thompson, get my doctor back on the
phone right away. My ulcer must be bleeding. And
bring that new medicine. I may have cancer.” He
picked up the phone again, all charm and dignity.
“Now, what was I saying? Oh, yes. . I would like to
inform you that we do not produce little stinkers, as
you call them.” His voice was volume-controlled,
but was now becoming louder. “I am sure,” he said,
“that each of us in the studio would appreciate your
showing more respect for our product. You give the
picture no prestige, no honor whatever. In the fu-
ture, please refer to this picture as what it really is,
the biggest stinker there ever was!”

The movie industry knows full-well the value
and scarcity of good titles, and they are quick to pick
them up. <A good example: A studio happily
bought a book that clearly could not be filmed, but
its title was worth the price. It was the stunning
REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE, a title packed with
drama, and a magnetic punch. Other good titles:
SUDDENLY, LAST SUMMER (Puts a question in
the mind, what happened so suddenly, last summer?)
Jets) IDA AI WMeUe) OI Ole Wald) SAwAJORS
(Yeah? What’s up there?)

Of course, a title does not stand alone. BABY
DOLL might make you think possibly of sweet little
girl and her iddy-bitty toys, but—put Tennessee
Williams’ name in front of it and Carroll Baker’s
name in back of it. Does the meaning change slight-
ky? Wow bet it does!

Ah, but as in all things, there must be the ex-
ception that makes the rule. A notable exception:
THE NAKED MAJA is certainly a good title. Ava
Gardner playing THE NAKED MAJA makes it pos-
itively startling, and one that should be a sure-fire
winner, but no. It was a dull picture and it fell flat
on its naked face. The ever-expanding knowledge
and sophistication of the public have taken them to
the point where they are considerably more selective.

In the good old days when Warner Brothers had
its stable of million dollar gangsters, ready to inhabit
any jail at the drop of a contract, there were some
brilliant, imaginative and subtle prison titles, with
equally fine stories. For Alcatraz: THE HOUSE A-
CROSS THE BAY, for Sing-Sing: CASTLE ON THE
HUDSON, and so on. But now-a-days the prison
scene has been relegated to a lowly position, with
subtle-as-a-boml, mnot-so-hot titles, such as BIG
HOUSH, USA and REVOLT IN THE BIG HOUSE.
Exception: HOUSE OF NUMBERS, a title as clever
as its story, about San Quentin this time.

Women’s names have always held a certain
fascination (ROXIE HART, MILDRED PIERCE,
JEZEBEL and a few million others). Of course, a
bad woman sells much easier than a good woman.
Two producers went stone broke trying to prove
otherwise. Walter Wanger spent every nickel he
could borrow in an abortive effort to sell JOAN OF
ARC. No sale. It was the second-greatest disaster in
filmdom. It took a decade for Walter to get back on
his feet again. And who put him on the comeback

EASTERN ECHO

trail? Why, another woman of course, but this time
it was one not quite so saintly as Joan. This one was
Barbara Graham. Babs conveniently walked into
the gas chamber and inspired one of the greatest
come-backs in screen history!

I mentioned that Walter’s Joan was the second-
greatest disaster. Now, to the greatest. It came
many years later and can be eredited to Otto Prem-
inger, a brave producer if ever there was one. The
jolgiuee? = Way, JOUN Ol AIRC, whet, elee? TL
Walter couldn’t do it with Ingrid Bergman, the big-
gest star in the business, Otto could, with an un-
known. Final results: The girl became known (as
one who left the farm too soon) and the film became
known, too (as the first flop to be total and abso-
lute) !

Never under-estimate Hollywood though where
their titles are concerned. And don’t believe every-
thing you read, either. Let us follow the headlines
on a new picture: UNIVERSAL SIGNS ROCK
TEQUIDISOIN ZUINID) IDOIIIS IDA INO) SAR JUN “IP Ibe
LOW TALK” followed later by “PILLOW TALK”
MOO) SUGCGIESIMOV IS,  INMIMEIS) IMO) 1818) CUELAINGHEID
followed later by “PILLOW TALK” CHANGED TO
“ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS” followed by
“ANY WAY THE WIND BLOWS” NEARS COM-
PLETION. The headlines suddenly and convenient-
ly cease. Next comes the first ad for the picture, a
two-page number, with this title: PILLOW TALK,
and with this sub-title: IT’S WHAT GOES ON
WHEN THE LIGHTS GO OFF! You see, from the
beginning they had no intentions of giving up their
good title. The moral of this episode is simple: Pub-
licity, like gold, is where you find it.

Then there is what is known as “this year’s ti-
tle.” Last year it was ANATOMY OF A MURDER.
As it trickled off the tongues of millions that little
word, anatomy, suddenly became a real cutie. It was
quickly picked up by an authoress, who called her
biography, modestly enough, ANATOMY OF ME.
A judge, concerned with communism called his AN-
ATOMY OF FREEDOM. More could be named, but
since the point is made, let’s go on to find the finale:

A title that could top any lst of those most ap-
propriate. And this one dates way back to a remark
made in 1932. It was Mae West’s first movie, and
when someone commented on her progress, exclaim-
ing, “Goodness!” Mae turned, dropped an eye-lash
or two and uttered the words that were to become
the title of her biography 27 years later, “Goodness
Tela, Nowlamage Wo Io Wann Jr b

I could probably write a book on titles, but since
it wouldn’t be the best book in the world, I’d have to
make sure it had the best title, and think what a hell
of a time I'd have finding that!
