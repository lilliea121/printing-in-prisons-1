Trombone Section:

Henry Upshur, Ist Trombone: A Trustee.

For Henry there is no such thing as a mental ease or
physical relaxation in the demanding routine of play-
ing his Trombone. His capacity for work is unlimit-
ed, and those mellow tones coming from “Henry's
Bone” are well worth the listening effort. He is

also a member of the Concert Band.

Harry Farrell, Ist Trombone: Deputy’s Clerk.

Ain't nuttin worse than a trombone player with an
asthmatic condition. A fine musician who is one of
the original group, but who has been fighting the
humidity and asthma and its effects on the trombone.

Also a Concert Band Member.
Melvin McFall, 2nd Trombone: A Commissary Em-

ployee, who gives out with the “‘goodies’’ every week
at the window, and on weekends, he gives out with
the smears, glisses and accents on the “‘bone.’’ Glad
you re swinging with us Mel.

the greatest energy and causing much complemen-
tary comment. He's coming, and smiling all the
way. A Concert Band Member.

Rhythm Section:

Cleve Brown, Bass: Cafeteria Employee.

The most physically relaxed, the quietest and most
amiable fellow in the group. A darn nice guy who
plucks the “L”’ out of that Viol, and musically cor-

rect, too.

‘Fats’? Robertson, Guitar: A Print Shop Employee.
Lawrence Welk couldn't possibly use him, Fats is
strictly ““‘West Coast’’ and is a terriffic symbol of the
cool, airy style that was developed there. Can play
any style, but prefers the more modern arrange-
ments. Dosen't see eye to eye on the use of “Cow

Bells’ by the drummer.
John “‘Snooks” Jackson, Guitar: A Print Shop Em-

ployee. Snooks is at present under the wing of Fats
Robertson—sitting in at every session and playing
along, while paying close attention to the finger ma-
nipulations and chord changes of Fats. Snooks will
be there and ready, if Fats is ever hit by a trolley or

bus while he is waiting for parole.

Frank Murphy, Drummer: A Print Shop Employee
An ‘old school’? drummer from the Dixie era. He
is the oldest member in years and is looked upon by
“the boys’ as the father of the group. Frank is a
hard swinger, driving the band constantly; can be
subtle on ballads when necessary and will “drop

bombs’ with the best of them. His big cymbal

work behind the soloist’s is exceptionally tasty. Be-
sides his drumming chores, Frank is Business Man-
ager of the band, taking care of the many require-
ments necessary for the smooth operation of a large
dance orchestra. He is also Concert Band Drummer.

Dental Lab Employee.
A beginner with all the necessary basic equipment,

Socrates Cantoral, Drums:

who has a fine sense of rhythm, quick to learn the
various stick manipulations and young enough to de-
velop into a fine drummer. Never misses a session
and is always ready to take instruction. A comer-—
real soon. Also plays Bass Drum in the Concert

Reval,

Leon Cross, Vocals and Bongos: Cafeteria Em-
ployee. Leon has the smooth easy delivery of the
vocals that make for easy listening, plus a vital and
invigorating command of the bongos, a brilliant
rhythmic sense and an infallable ear.. Excellent

addition to our rhythm section for specialty numbers.

Preston E. Seals, Prop Man: Dental Lab Em-
ployee. Where would we be without ‘Press’ First
on the scene, setting up for everyone, and the very
last to leave after putting the equipment away.
Always a smile or a suggestion to make it easier for
someone, and above all, ever ready to lend a hand
wherever needed. Our number one fan and a friend
to every band member, and every band member is

his friend.

Joe Fatio, Leader and Trumpet: A Print Shop Em-
ployee. Joe has brought his outside experience into
our group, he has added a dash of exuberance, and
coupled it with his fertile personality and artistic in-
tuition and come up with the attributes that en-

not spare himself.

Whatever course the musical composition
of the future takes, it will surely thrive, if all those
who love music will endeavor to provide it with the
means of self-expression; if everyone in his own
station will contribute his share to the furtherance of

its cultivation.
