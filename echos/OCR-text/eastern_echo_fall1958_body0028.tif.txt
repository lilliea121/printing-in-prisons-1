If an outsider asked me how he could best help
shige spuisome. leawoulds say. Wate maim: llelp
him get out if you can, but while you’re doing that,
write him.”

“Few things can help a prisoner’s morale more
than letters, tangible reminders that he has not
been completely forgotten, that he still ‘belongs’.
Perhaps his offense deserved bitter punishment. If
so, he’s getting that. Don’t make his load unbear-
able by forsaking him, by kicking him when he’s
down, unless you hate him completely.”

Today the state banishes men behind high stone
walls, but leaves loopholes in that exile; it allows
men to write and receive letters, and even to receive
visits from relatives. Without these loopholes, I
wonder how much the prison suicide rate would
climb.

So Mr. and Mrs. Outsider, if you feel kindly
toward some convict somewhere in his exile, write
io© Ina, IB; mor gui, Om ln@lclkeys, Wheis mor
enough. Better to “dummy up” entirely than to lift
the blanket of loneliness for just a moment, and to
drop its smothering folds about him once more by
forgetting him again. Chances are you have post-
age and time. He may only have time. Write to
him.

GIVE ME THE ANSWER

A departing inmate, was asked, “Do you think
prisons will ever change?”

He replied, “Prisons will change in the years to
come, as the outside world is changing. The people
are getting better ideas about prisons and prisoners
all the time. We will have better treatment staffs
to help the prisoner get and keep the right attitude,
and to keep the public informed as to the progress
that is being made. If people outside will continue
to learn more about prisoners’ characteristics, they
will be better equipped to help the man to take his
place in society.” |

AWRIGHT KNOCK IT OFF

quite so startling as to be awakened in the middle of

RED CROSS BLOOD MOBILE

On July 2nd of this year, the Red Cross Blood
Mobile rolled into ESP, to receive donations of blood,
unfortunately we made a poor showing. Out of
804 men eligible to contribute, only 67 volunteered.
This 1s .088% of the eligible population.

ANOTHER PURPLE PEOPLE EATER???

To prove that nothing escapes SNOOPY. There
are some things you just gotta print. This one be-
longs to Dave Aikens. He came up with this
“Purple People Hater” riddle.

“What weighs 1000 pound, has four legs, is
yellow, and lives in a cage?”

Ok, here goes.
Two 500 pound canaries!!!

Don’t blame me.

PAUL GOFF THE SLIDE MAN

When it comes to playing a slide trom-
bone, Snoopy likes the playing style of PAUL GOFF.
Snoopy played dixieland jazz trumpet alongside of
Paul’s trombone in the “ECHOS.” Paul is develop-
ing a style of his own. His tone is clear and
mellow, and his execution is among the best. Paul
devotes all his time to practice, for he is determined
to master the trombone. Snoopy thinks he will.

WHY DONT THEY??
