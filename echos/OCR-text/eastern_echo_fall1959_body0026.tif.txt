Storehouse League continued

winners of the First Half, and promise to fight hard-
er to knock the Lynx from their throne.

Credit tor the Lynx victory must ¢o to the
amazing “Rooster” who can and generally does play
every position on the field. Also, to Bob “The Arm”
3olding, the amazing pitcher, who sparks the Lynx
to play inspired ball. Bolding sports a 21 and 8 rece-
ord as we go to press. Make no mistake,—the Lynx
are the team to beat.

It is unbelievable that Sidney, the most likable
fellow in the league, can come into such hard luck.
Year after year the Rockets start off high on the
ladder and then slowly drift backwards. As Leo
Durocher once said, “Nice guys always finish last.”
The Rockets must win the big games to win the race.

The Phillies and Lynx opened the Second Half
with the Phillies winning a beautifully pitched game
by a 4 to 3 score. Miketish, on the mound for the
Phillies, struck out ten batters and in the last inn-
ing, with the tying run on base, he fanned the side.
The second game went to the Lynx by a 2 to 1 score
in the best played game of the season.

Our report ends with a statement from Hayman,
the fiery manager of the Cardinals, who feels that
tins is the year tor his team: Manager Hayman

states that his team is playing great ball (they are),
and that they will give the rest of the league a run
for their money in the remaining games.

STOREHOUSE STARS TOP CEDARWOOD A.C.

On Sunday afternoon, July 12, Haywood and
his Storehouse League All-Stars played host to the
Cedarwood A.C. in a well-managed and well-played
game that went into extra innings. The localites,
with heads-up base running by Ray of the Phillies,
won out by a 2 to 1 score in the 11th inning.

Basketball League

The Basketball League officially opened on Aug.
4, League competitive play didn’t actually begin
until Aug. 6. The opening day game between the
Dons and Reliable A. C. was decided by a forfeit in
favor of the Dons, because John “Obie” O’Brien,
manager of Reliable, wasn’t able to field a complete
team at game time.

The game played on the 6th, between the Hawks
and the Warriors, was one marked by hustle and
fine shooting on the part of both teams. Due to the
marksmanship of Tailgate, great rebounding by
Shakey and Cochise, and steady ball handling by
Fleming, Ray, Whalen, Mick, and Snooks, smart
playmiking by Brown and the fast breaks of Roose-
velt, the Warriors managed to eke out a two point
win, 58—d6. Fricker, Morrison and Bogardus were
high scorers for the Hawks. Curley and Freddy let
the Warriors know they were to be reckoned with,
being superb in snaring rebounds and setting up
plays. Norman was an asset to the team with his
all-around play.

RELIABLE DOWNS CELTICS, 50—34

Im a spirited, well-played affair, the Ccltics
bowed to a taller and stronger shooting Reliable
A.C. by 16 point margin. The Reliable attack was

24

led by Teeny Berry, very ably supported by O’Brien,
Brawner, James, Cornbread, and Billy who found
the basket quite regularly from outside. Rookies
Lyles and Tucker, new additions to the league, add-
ed their efforts to make Reliable the winner, 50 to
34. The Celtics are to be commended for their fine
play with Stonewall hustling and playing the boards
quite well. Blackie, Pinky and Rob rounded out a
balanced combination. In the second half the Reli-
able offense outmanevered the game Celtics. The
shooting spothght was captured by Shep who was
hitting from everywhere, though in a losing cause.
