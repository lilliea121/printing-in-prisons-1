Another demonstration of the public attitude to-
ward “do-gooders” was the recent awarding of the
“Man of the Year” plaque to the District Attorney of
our city. Since the District Attorney is a rightfully
respected figure in our society, such an award was
perhaps not unfitting. But it certainly seemed a wee
bit incongruous coming from the Prisoners’ Welfare
Society. We must either lament the shortage of avail-
able “do-gooders” more qualified for an award from
this particular society, or sympathize with the many
such people we have reason to know exist within the
“City of Brotherly Love.”

Perhaps some day the pendulum will swing the
other way, and “do-gooders” will once more be men
of honor with respected opinions—some day after the
once more inevitable failures of the “Get Tough
Policy” boys.

While on the subject of editorial cliches, I must
make mention of one even older than “‘do-gooders.”
How many times have you read the expression, “The
defendant showed no signs of remorse?” It seems
that certain unimaginative court-room reporters de-
pend on this old mainstay for what they may believe
is “human interest” copy, something to fill the dread
white spaces between the factual details, often unin-
teresting in themselves.

By “‘signs of remorse,” they seem to mean a pub-
lic wailing and gnashing of teeth with attendant cries
of, “I’m sorry, Your Honor.” Paradoxically, when
any defendant does behave in such a manner, and
does display any emotion resembling remorse, he is
described as a “sniveling coward.” Somewhere along
the line, the term “lack of remorse” has attained pop-
ular acceptance among newspaper fraternity as a
false synonym for self-control.

No connotation of the noun “remorse” carries
with it the qualification that the bearer must offer
evidence of the same to the public at the time of his
trial. Hach man earries within him the personal
traces of his own guilt, whether his sins be large or
small, and it remains for each individual to determine
his own means of personal expiation. Society’s de-
mands for vengeance and justice may be satisfied by
paying a fine or serving a prison sentence. This is a
public ordeal, and as such is open to public view.
Self-atonement is a private matter which may, or
may not, involve public declarations and demonstra-
tions, depending on the spiritual and mental needs of
the individual concerned. Such emotions are thank-
fully still private property, and yet subject to the
voracious appetite of a sometimes distorted “freedom
of the press.” 7 a | 7

As reported in “Editor and Publisher,” a Su-
preme Court decision (Marshall v. U.S. 360 U.S. 310)
reversing a criminal conviction on the ground that
prejudicial material had prevented a fair trial, was

the basis for a letter to the news media requesting
their cooperation in the Apalachin conspiracy case.

At the direction of the presiding judge, the chief
prosecutor wrote letters to all New York newspapers,
radio and TV stations. Part of the letter is quoted
as follows:

“In any free society there are necessarily times
when different freedoms threaten to conflict with
each other. The Marshall case suggests such a con-
flict between the freedom of the press guaranty of
the First Amendment and the impartial jury trial
guaranty of the Sixth Amendment: complete insula-
tion of the jury from outside impact could make fair
news comment impossible during a long trial; un-
limited and unrestrained public comment could make

“Without attempting to define any standard,
may I suggest that to the extent you consider such
limitation reasonable, fair, and in the total public in-
terest, news comment be restricted as much as pos-
sible to matters actually received in evidence before
the court.”

Judge Kaufman said he had asked the press to
use “the greatest restraint and good judgement in re-
porting the case, because I felt that regardless of the
background of these individuals, I was determined
that they would have a trial based on the evidence, a
trial which would not have crept into it any atmos-
phere that might appear in newspapers or any story
that might publish a criminal record of these defend-
ants during the course of the trial .... .

“So you can see the extent to which our demo-
cratic process goes in placing safeguards around de-
fendants on trial and seeing that they are afforded a
fae trial

All parties concerned in this action deserve our
sincere respect and commendations. However, I must
admit that in addition to the motive of fair play, I do
suspect other factors may have been considered in
writing such a letter.

The men being tried were all men of rather sub-
stantial wealth, and thus expected and capable of
appealing their conviction through every court in the
land. They were not individuals completely unversed
in matters of law, and were not being defended by
run-of-the-mill attorneys. It seems highly possible
that recognition of the latter factors may have
played a large part in the judge’s and prosecutor’s
efforts to obtain the cooperation of the news media
in holding down the usual trial by opinion before
trial by jury.

Let us hope, however, that a precedent has been
set which will enable other, more ordinary defend-
ants to obtain the same safeguards of a fair trial
which were sought for the Apalachin conspirators.
