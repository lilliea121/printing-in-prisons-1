With an air of expectancy we stood amid the
rustle and bustle of the spectators, our fellow in-
mates here at Eastern State Penitentiary, as they
assembled in the yard waiting the coming event.

This day marked the beginning of the second
inauguration of evening yard out. Also, for the
second time, within the confines of this gray struc-
ture, would echo the sweet tones of the Temple
Choir, reverberating throughout the inmate audi-
ence.

There were hushed whispers of adulation as the
Choir, elegantly dressed in beautiful, flowing, ma-
roon gowns, assembled on the make-shift ascending
stage. The heralding of summer, officially an-
nounced itself, with the downbeat of their intellec-
tual, humorous, and most amiable Choirmaster Mr.
Robert Page, and the talented voices of these young
pulchritudinous ladies and handsome gentlemen.

Keenly appreciative, and pleasing, were their
unique talents displayed, by their beautiful, deli-
cate, and excellent renditions of songs and anthems.
Marvelously sang in various languages, with com-
plete cadence of sound.

The very fact, that they were aptly adept at
instilling humor into their musical knowledge made
the quality of the program conclusively beautiful.
This was genuinely illustrated by their earthy, and
realistic musical portrayal of the ancient, sorrow-

Mr. Page and the Temple Choir.

filled composition, “Frankie and Johnny.”

To say they were wonderful, would only mini-
mize their wonderful talents. In speaking of this
wonderful group, what more can be said, except to
bestow our heart-felt thanks to Mr. Robert Page,
Mr. Ray Whittaker, and all others directly or in-
directly responsible for this glorious hour of happi-
ness.

In closing we would like to reveal a thought,
“Nothing is ever so dark and dismal that beauty of
song cannot filter a little ray of tranquil brightness
within its despairing darkness.”

Thomas Carlyle once said, “The meaning of
song goes deep. Who is there, that, in logical words,
can express the effect music has on us? <A kind of
inarticulate, unfathomable speech: which leads us
to the edge of the infinite, and lets us for moments
gaze into that!”

Again our sincerest gratitude and thanks.

WHAT ARE WE HERE FOR? Continued

the phase with which we are here concerned, is far
from being abreast with the sciences of nuclear
physies or Sputnik-ology. But a greater effort in this
direction can certainly promote the cause of ‘‘en-
lightened penology’’, and only our news media can
effect this, by fair presentation—especially in relation
to parole.

Socializing or resocializing programs—psycho-
therapy, vocational, academic and recreational pro-
erams—help build sturdy character, but real social
maturity can only be realized in a social environment,
and parole is the means whereby this can be
accomplished.

The expedient of parole is the most promising
corrective of penology (statistics maintain this) and
should be encouraged as concientiously as the ‘‘atom
protege’’ of the last decade.

EASTERN ECHO

Or is vengeance still the aim of penology? If
so, then, our Penal Publications and our greatest
proponent, Mrs. Public Relations of the Penal Press
and First Lady of the thousands of ‘‘exiled’’ men and
women in this country and abroad, DOT SCHEER,
and the Joe Paulls, Ray Whittakers, Charles Shaws,
Portia Perrys and Thatcher Longstreths, and num-
bers of others whose civic-mindedness and commend-
able efforts toward creating a better understanding
between the public and the ‘‘rehabilitating Inmate’’,
and dispelling the Newsmonger’s leading. misinfor-
mation—that stigmatizes and impedes the resociali-
zation program and the conscientious delinquent’s
progress; the anathema of penal and corrective
progress—are laboring in vain, and the whole science
of MODERN PENOLOGY is an inane humanity,
a prodigal expenditure.

Do we practice the barbaric philosophy that
we condemn ?
