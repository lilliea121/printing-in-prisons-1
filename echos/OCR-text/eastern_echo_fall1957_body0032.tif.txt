the wedding gift

trotted through the alley . . . retraced his steps
through the vacant lot to the car. Behind the wheel
again, he peered at his watch in the dim mist-
reflected light of the street lamp. 3:12. Ethyl had
given him more trouble than he’d expected, but he
was right on schedule. Fifteen minutes back to the
office. He’d make it, alright. Just like he’d plan-
ned. And the fog covered his movements perfectly.
IBIS oe that’s what it took.

As Joe drove carefully back to the broadcasting
station he thought about the wife he had hated, lying
dead on the living room floor. And he smiled in
self satisfaction. He thought about Nicci. Nicci
with the beautiful face. Nicci with the sweet smell-
ing .... more beautiful body; Nicci waiting for
him in her apartment over on Center Street. Joe
smiled again, mentally savoring the delights Nicci’s
lovely body would give him in the future. He
thought about the child that would be born in about
five months; about the marriage that would follow
after things quieted down concerning Ethyl’s murder.

Joe parked the car ... entered the red brick
building. When he hung his hat and coat on the
rack, the clock in the glass enclosed room said... .
3:28 A.M.

Quickly he took his seat in front of the table
mike and as the last section of the record’s music
faded, his resonant voice said, ‘‘Wasn’t that beauti-
ful... just beautiful? Gosh! I wish I could play
musi¢ like that. But I do play it, though, don’t I?
I spin these platters for you old sleepy-heads night
after night, so I guess you could say I play that kind
of music. Maybe I should have said morning after
morning instead of night after night, because right
now it is exactly 3:32 A.M.”’

While he spoke, Joe carefully placed his next
record on the turn-table. As the soft music filled
the room and danced out over the air waves, Joe
started the erase mechanism on the tape recorder.
The tape shot backward on its reel, completely wiping
out the incriminating record of Joe’s voice. The
only voice that could give him away to the police.

4:35 A.M. Joe’s voice and the music droned on
ands One... e

5:50. His sister-in-law and husband should have
found his wife’s body by now . . . called the police.

6:29. La Vie en Rose was spinning on the turn-
table. Police should be here any second.

Joe glanced up ... saw Raphael Allison, the
Chief of Police, and two burly detectives from the
Homicide Squad watching through the thick, plate
glass. Their eyes were cold, impersonal, but yet
tinged with a look of disgust. And Joe felt a tingle
of fear race madly up and down his spine. But no
eee they couldn’t know a thing. Everything had
gone perfectly.

Joe changed records, putting on two extras for
added time. He smiled... raised his hand in salute.
Walked into the reception room where Allison and his
men waited. ‘‘What’s up, Chief?’’ Joe asked, and
added ‘‘ Kind of late for you to be roaming around,
isn Wy

‘‘Never too late when murder is involved, Joe,’’
the Chief replied, his booming voice filling the tiny
cubicle.

‘‘Murder?’’ Joe asked quizzically, cocking his
head to one side. ‘*‘Who?’’

‘‘Don’t you know, Joe?”’

‘No... why should I?”’

‘“Tt’s your wife, Joe.’’

s (My wile; |. My... i my witelli? Joes face
blanched white as the reality of what he had done
struck home.

“Yeah ...Joe! Your wife! Why did you do
it?’’

“‘“Me ... do it?’’ Joe asked shrilly, his voice
beginning to crack as honest-to-God fear crept into
his bones. ‘‘Are you erazy, Allison! I’ve been
right here all night and Ethyl was all right when I
left.’? Joe began to sob wildly, hoping he was con-
vineing; hoping he’d be able to make them believe
his artificial sorrow.

“"No, you haven’t, Joe,’’ the Chief replied
quietly, and added, ‘‘What do you eall this?’’ He
handed Joe a small, beautifully illustrated card.

Fingers trembling, Joe reached for the proffered
paper. His eyes, through crocodile tears, sought the
fine, even seript. His wife’s handwriting! ‘‘To my
Darling Husband on our Tenth Wedding Anniver-
sary.’’ it said. ‘‘It’s Been Wonderful, Joe’’ and it
was signed, ‘‘ All My Love, Ethyl.’’

Joe sucked air into his lungs. Relief flooded his
being. They didn’t have a thing! They were just
guessing. ‘‘What are you trying to do, Allison,”’
he smiled, bluffing, ‘‘be funny ?”’

‘Not at all, Joe,’’ the Chief replied gently. He
turned to one of his men. ‘‘Show him what we
found in the living room, Meyers.’’

One of the detectives reached down on the floor .
.... Set a covered cage on the desk. The other
moved in behind Joe. Ready.

“Yor like amma - = bins, -
that?’’ Chief Allison asked.

‘“Yes, but my wife has been killed. What’s that
bird cage have to do with it?’’ Joe asked angrily.

Meyers whipped the sheet. off the cage and Joe
looked at the Parrakeet. The brilliantly-hued bird
stared owlishly at Joe. ‘‘Awk,’’ it said. ‘‘You’re
crazy, Joel Youre crazy! Ponts 4-donet —.*
oh, for God’s sake; Joe! Don’t... don’t.. don’t.’
