me fleeing to this wilderness in the first place. Oh,
occasionally, | had a fleeting thought of the past,
but none of them had ever nagged me while I was
awake, or invaded my dreams. I supposed that the
nightmare had some connection with the girl com-
ing, but even that reasoning was rather sketchy. To
be sure, I felt deep concern for her, plus a certain
amount of tenderness, but | quite honestly attested
these feelings to her terrible plight and her apparent
haunting past. For there was no question in my
mind that her act was an attempt at suicide.

Suddenly, I was very tired again. It was a
different kind of tiredness, though, and this time
when | lay down in my pile of furs, I felt free of the
burden of the past few days and slept a dream free,
restful sleep.

The girl remained in the same state for the
next few days, but on the morning of the seventh
day after the crash I was cleaning up the breakfast
mess from Bo and I, when I heard her speak for the
first time. The words were the product of a delirious
outburst, and | attributed the phrasing to the com-
bination of the medication I had given her and her
lingering, bewildering condition. The words were
clearly spoken and precise, but at the same time,
they were ladened with pathetic overtones. It was
a mournful pleading, and I was surprised that it
touched me with emotion and compassion when she
spoke. “‘Kathy, honey,” she begged. “It’s mommy.
Wake up sweetheart, Mommy’s come back,’ This
was followed by a choking sob, and then silence
again.

I went over to her right away, but she was
mute again, sleeping softly and breathing easily.
Although her general condition had greatly im-
proved, I was now confounded and perplexed by
her extended unconsciousness. | couldn't help but
wonder at this point if somehow her long lapse was
in some way self-imposed.

I took stock of our situation, trying to figure
out what I should do. Here we were, miles and miles
away from any qualified medical help, with no pos-
sible way to obtain it. For it would be unthinkable
of me to try to go after help, knowing that the girl’s
very existance depended on my being with her all
the time. It would also be useless for Bo. He was
a perfect watchdog and a pleasant companion, but
I knew he didn’t measure up to one of those mira-
cle animals you hear about who travel great dis-
tances for help and then lead the rescue party back.
No, good ol’ Bo couldn’t do that. There was no

way I could strap the girl back in the cart in her
condition, and try to drag her over sixty-three
jarring miles of the most rugged terrain in the coun-
try. None of us would have made it anyway, for it
would have taken weeks, and the first frost had al-
ready set in. And I wouldn’t even consider a large
signal fire, as the late autumn winds were whipping
around now, and an uncontrolled forest fire would
be suicide. Besides, who would ever see it?

So by eliminating all the “‘cannots,’’ I was left
with the “‘cans,’’ On one hand I could do only what
I had been doing, and if things went on in this
manner, the girl would surely die. I couldn’t hope to
sustain her much longer under the present condi-
tions and I didn’t want the memory of a dead wom-
an as a burden on my mind. That | wouldn’t tole-
rate if there was any possible way I could avoid it,
so I made the only decision that I thought would be
right. | made up my mind that I would shock the
girl out of her coma at all costs. There was no ques-
tion about it now. I would definitely need her
assistance in order to save her life.

] was sitting with both elbows on the table and
my head in my hands, thinking. Just thinking.
When the sudden harsh laughter crashed around
me. The girl had wakened and managed to raise
herself slightly with her good left arm and was
laughing at me, bitterly and sarcastically. Her face
was etched with gnawing pain, but she was indeed
laughing. It stopped then, just as abruptly as it had
started, and her first words came to me in a halting,
malicious tone that could not be mistaken.

“Well, well, well!’ she mocked. “Just who in
the hell are you supposed to be? Daniel Boone or
Jesus Christ in buckskins, or maybe even some kind
of a sick nut that goes around stripping women’s
clothes off?”

To hear the girl come back from the dead was
enough of a jolt, but her deep rooted, evil taunting
and open blasphemy gave me a quick start. Not that
I was a pure hearted prude or a religious fanatic
(which I am not), but her fiery tongue lashing was
so acidly stark and unexpected that I was caught
quite by surprise to say the least. Furthermore, |
was completely astounded to hear this kind of talk
from so seriously injured person, and a woman at
that!

I felt like a stupid jackass, in spite of the com-
promising role | had played the past several days,
by just standing there with my mouth open while
she stared at the roof beams and beleagured the
rustic ceiling with more stinging barbs. “I purposely
come out here to the end of the world,” she ranted,
“and try to do just one thing right in my lifetime,
