ingly,” are periodicals entirely free from
official pressure. They alone,” he adds,
‘chave genuine sparkle and vitality, and
generate in the inmate population real
interest and support.”

The librarian—no Johnny-come-late-
ly—goes on to say that lesser journals
depend on the personal column for reader
interest. The personal “briefs” he al-
ludes to can be readily demonstrated by
an invention of the moment: ‘‘Big Joe
in cell block 50 (we feel safe with that
number) got his lips burnt blowing hot
trumpet—some scorcher, eh Joe?” Such
briefs are popular among some inmates
because they are like some politicians to
whom a bad press is better than none.
Just what this adds to the “bridge” is
difficult to determine even by the more
initiate. All that is known, however, is
the fact that they bask in the temporary
notoriety conferred and strut among their
fellows as benefactors whose little tricks
have helped to brighten ‘‘gloomy” days.
In short, the personals are as clear to the
inmate as a Broadway column is to the
initiate.

According to our enlightened source,
as one ascends the scale from the anemic
to the full-blooded publications, the per-
sonals decrease in importance and give
way to “genuine news of the institution,
written straight.” ‘Exchange columns,’’
he says, ‘‘are almost universally a species
of genial back-slapping.’’ This amounts
to little more than—Z like your magazine
Charlie, hope you like ours, too. This of
course, harms no one and helps the ex-
change editor who might be short on
morale, if nothing else! “Humor, most
often jejune and lackluster,’ Mr. Spector
says, “fills more space in the weaker
publications.’’ He describes the poetry
that is published in all publications, with
one exception, as ‘‘a dull reflection of
the Service or Guest school.’ The ex-
ception noted is a women’s magazine,
(would-be impersonators take note) the
Hagle of the Federal Reformatory at Al-
derson, “which prints more verse and bet-
ter than most of the men’s papers.’’ At
the very top, the outstanding magazines
in the whole field, the Atlantian, New
Era both Federal institutions, and The
Presidio of Iowa State Penitentiary,
make better use of photographs than any
other journal, few having the finances,
skill and/or liberty to include them.

Mr. Spector explains that inmate
publications, with few exceptions, live on
slender budgets and the editorial staff
must use frequent stratagems to stretch
the funds at their disposal. “Where par-
simony does not rule,’ he says, “maga-
zines of exceptional quality issue from
the institution.’?’ He adds, that this is
true of most Federal institutions under
the policy set by Director James V. Ben-
nett. “The results of this encourage-
ment,’’ he explains, “are startling, for
as a class, the publications of the Federal
prisons are outstanding in the freedom
given the editors, the interest shown in
the magazine by the inmates and the
quality of the papers? Mr. Spector
further points out that the Atlantian has
grown from an anemic sheet, insipidly

is a slick-paper job, marked by good typo-
graphy and layout, and holding within its
covers a consistently well-balanced serv-
ing of reading matter.’’ He attributes
the excellence of this publication to the
talent available at Atlanta—including
former staff members of demonstrated
ability as “Red” Rudensky, Dick Jordan
and Bob Patterson—and the liberal pol-
icy of both the institution and the Fed-
eral Bureau of Prisons.

Credo of the Penal Press
—Viaq AGRICOLA

The Penal Press endeavors to calendar
man in his challenge to remain productive
in a censored existence. For man must
live with himself in spite of ali hazards;
and think, regardless of physical enslaye-
ment; and to the end, realize a need to
be wanted and, to be needed.

Such thinking and determination has
taught society that even in the air of
degeneration there can be born fresh hope
and progress. For through the rapid pro-
jection of ideas casting a shadow, lies the
little peoples’ will, the redemption of lost
causes and the media for voice.

Herein are voices not individuals, but
individuals that are instruments to pro-
gress democratiically dedicated.

flat nose and loose lips barely covering
fang-like teeth’ Therein lies a tale of
public dis-service in the form of yellow
journalism, for it not only incites preju-
dice in the public mind, but hinders the
progress of sound prison administration.

“Netually.?) he “says, “they “are a
strangely normal-looking group.” Because
of the lush growth of statutory crimes,
he explains, ‘‘prisoners come from an in-
creasingly broader wedge of society,
and are no longer only the uneducated
misfits who can be classified and treated
in groups.’’ Mr. Spector further points
out, that in trying to remake offenders,
“prisons nowhere have approached the
ideal as it exists in Samuel Butler’s
Erewhon—of treating them as sick men
come to a hospital; but in the use of new
methods and individual approaches, con-
siderable progress has been made toward
the ideal of curing prisoners of their ills
and remaking their personalities. ”

To off-set or invalidate much of the
sensationalism in the vast public com-
munications media, some prison journals
resort to photo-journalism with consider-
able success. For concientious adminis-
trators are increasingly cognizant of the

fact that even a limited amount of photo-
journalism wisely utilized, does more to
dispel ancient prejudices than columns
of words more or less buried in seas of
gray. Journeyman “bridgemen,’’ (though
hardly considered photo-genic) do not
hesitate to pose even with the most “de-
spised’’ correctional officer. For they
are mentally mature enough to rid them-
Selves of personal bias in favor of intel-
lectual bias. Further, there is always the
possibility the “screw” of today may be-
come the vital “rivet” in the span of to-
morrow. It has not infrequently happen-
ed. Chances are he wasn’t a bad guy,
after all! Let’s face it. Inmates can get
pretty sick at times... and are a long
way ‘‘come to a hospital.” The writer,
admittedly is no exception!

Perey L. Lainson, former warden of
Iowa State Penitentiary for 16 years,
who was recently elevated to a higher
post in the field of corrections, has fre-
quently permitted his inmates to be
photographed even with local citizens who
take an active interest in the institution’s
rehabilitation program. As a matter of
fact, no less than 55 (that’s right, 55)
cuts or prints appeared in the Presidio’s
May, 1959 edition. What bridgemen!

Considered by many, if not all, of its
competitors in an all-time high of some
250 publications as the nation’s foremost
walled-in monthly, The Presidio has cele-
brated its 25th consecutive year of pub-
lishing, and enjoys a circulation in excess
of 5000 paid domestic and foreign sub-
scribers. The excellence of this maga-
zine—no less a slick-paper job than the
Atlantian—stems from the keen insight
of former Warden Lainson and the talent
of well-motivated inmates available at
the Fort }ladison prison. For what other
masthead could billboard the uneaptured
souls of former captive scribes of ingen-
ious and demonstrated ability as the late
Tom Runyon, Lee Sweeney, Clark Nejed-
ly, Jack Vandermyn, Bob Neese, and
others too numerous to mention? Of this
illustrious group, no prison scribe would
hesitate to single out Tom Runyon as the
most outstanding. For it was he who
actually gave The Word, passed it along
the line where it was picked up, echoed,
resounded, and implemented; often with
agonizing, grief and sacrifice, but with
no regrets. For bridgemen grow 10 feet:
tall with the least suspicion of it, and the
pains and pleasures of it just now take
hold as mere memories.

Tom Runyon was a lifer who defies
description, and it would be almost sac-
riligious to disturb the grave of a man
who gave so much to so many for so little
in return. It is suffice only to say, that
after nearly a quarter of a century of
eontinous imprisonment, he died (not
passed away, for in death there is life)
peacefully in his sleep. It was the most
gruesome “execution” in recorded “get-
tough” penology.

Since the writer expects to pass
through the gigantic waterless lock in
reverse by the time this installment ap-
pears in print, he would beg his readers’
