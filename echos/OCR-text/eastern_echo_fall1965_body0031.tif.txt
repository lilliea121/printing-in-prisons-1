Such shouted

were heard by the players of
the Storehouse League through
the first half of the Little Lea-

players who were noted for
shouting remarks like these—

half of the season. And who were the
chief instigators? Well, just to mention
a few: Brown, Kingsley, Williams,
Benny and Brumskill.

The umpires, however, remained cool
and calm through all these rhubarbs. Is
this typical of the Storehouse League?
Yes. That’s the big drawing card for
the League.
