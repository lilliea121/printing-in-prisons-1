Condensed from ‘‘Crime & Insanity’”’

N a dozen states, irresistible impuise is a de-
fense to a crime committed because of such
impulse. On the face of it, one would expect
irresistible impulse to be a defense every-
where. It seems illogical to hold a man ac-
countable for what he could not avoid doing.
Yet most jurisdictions are skeptical of this defense.
Every man 1s accountable for restraining antisocial
impulses. ‘‘There could never be a conviction’ ex-
a ce
plained one Judge, as far back as 1881, ‘‘if the guilty
could assert an impulse produced by some pressure
which he could not resist. To restrain such impulses
is the duty of all men. He who yields to them, must
take the consequences.”’

If an epileptic, during a convulsion, strikes a by-
stander, no one charges the epileptic with assault. It
an armed bandit compels a victim to remove his
pants, no one charges the victim with exposure. Yet
when the compulsion arises, not from external duress
or physical disease, but rather from inner emotional
disturbance, the law—in most states—exacts its
pound of flesh.

Should the criteria of criminal responsibility there-
fore be enlarged to include irresistible impulse as a
defense? Is this medically sound, socially desirable,
legally workable?

Confusion arises because, from the doctor’s view-
point, there are three different kinds of impulsive
behavior : the psychotic, the neurotic, and the normal.
Legal precedents generally fail to distinguish be-
tween them. So far as I know, this division of irresis-
tible impulse into these three categories has not been
previously published. The three types of impulse are:

(a) Explosive reactions in psychotic (insane)
persons.

12

(b) Obsessional compulsions in neuroties (ex-
ample: pyromania).

(c) Rage reactions in persons with no psychosis
or psychoneurosis.

EGALLY, the irresistible impulse doctrine
was designed to apply to the first (psychotic
or ‘‘insane’’) category. When legislators and
judges speak of irresistible impulse, they
mean the psychotic (insane) defendant. But
to most doctors, the phrase suggests the com-
pulsions of the compulsive or obsessional neurotic. To
the doctor, irresistible impulse usually means psycho-
neurosis; to the lawyer, it usually means psychosis.
The two professions are not speaking the same lan-
euage here.

Many court decisions sustain the position that
irresistible impulse was intended to limit its applica-
tion to psychotic (insane) defendants. One of the
first relevant decisions in Anglo-American law (1868)
included the phrase :

‘Tf it should be definitely established that the de-
fendant had an unsound condition of the mind, a
diseased mind, in which he is, by insane impulse pro-
ceeding from the diseased intellect, irresistibly driven
to commit the act, then the law must modify ancient
ChOwitTEMe, ””

The words in Boid Face should make it clear that
the court meant insanity, and nothing short of it.
ven when the accepted medical term for a neurosis
is used, the legal decision often makes it clear that a
psychosis is contemplated. ‘‘Kleptomania is a species
of insanity.’’ That’s the way the court put it, ob-
viously confusing psychoneurosis (kleptomanic is a
neurosis) with a psychosis (only psychoses are
species of insanity). Another court used this word-
ine: ‘‘ He was, in consequence of his insanity wrought
up to a frenzy which rendered him unable to control
his acts.’’ In another case, the defense was acceptable
because, in the court’s words, “‘there was such over-
whelming violence of mental disease that he was not
a responsible moral agent.’’ The Parsons case is
generally hailed as the one which liberalized the an-
cient and rigid doctrine. But even here, the court
admitted only such impulse as was rooted in psycho-
sis, for the first criterion was: ‘‘ Was the defendant
afflicted with disease of the mind, idiotic, or otherwise
insane?’’ Only if the answer were ‘“‘yes’’ did the
other part of the rule (the exculpation by reason of
irresistible impulse) operate. The test was, ‘‘whether
by reason of this mental disease he had lost the power
to choose between right and wrong.’’ In another state
it was held that the ‘“‘inability to refrain from the
wrong’’ must be due to ‘“‘impairment of the mind by
disease.’’ At the other end of the country, a court
held that irresistible impulse was an acceptable de-
fense only when it rose from disease. In another
jurisdiction, the exculpatory phrase was ‘‘loss of
power to resist temptation’’ but this was irrevocably
tied to ‘‘insanity.’’. The loss of self-control was held
exculpatory in another state only when it was ‘“‘due
to the overwhelming violence of mental disease.’’ The
