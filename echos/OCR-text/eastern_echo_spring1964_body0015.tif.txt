THE PLAYER

by Donald Paley

Marty Dee was a Beatnik. Ten years ago he would
have been a common bum. But now, 1963, his posi-
tion among the ranks of the unemployed was con-
sidered by many to be an act of defiance against an
established social norm. His contempt for the things
that were accepted as being standard procedure by
the majority of other people, made him a “‘renegade”’
and ‘‘arebel.’’ He loved his role dearly. His obvious
reluctance to conform even slightly to the society sur-
rounding him, also affected his mode of dress (which
in addition to helping him perpetuate his image as the
angry young man, also served another very practical
purpose—he couldn’t afford a suit).

‘The Last Resort Coffee

House’’—which was a block from his room—in what

He made the scene,

was becoming the traditional garb, almost the uni-
form of ‘‘the restless ones’ of his day; low-cut olive
drab sneakers, black stretch socks, tight black chinos,
black turtleneck sweater; and, of course, the inevit-
able symbol, the necessary sign of being at variance
with all things conventional—the unruly, unkempt,
monk-like hair cut. He was in. Not only didn’t he
have to work for a living, but he was part of a group
where unemployment was accepted, even expected,

and he wasn’t LAZY, he was rebellious.

Marty walked out of the coffee shop into the two
A.M. night. He was alone, as he wanted to be, and
not in any humor that could be considered a good
one. He walked. There wasn’t any place to go; there-
fore, no reason to hurry. He slowly, automatically,

walked towards the part of his neighborhood that
was most pleasant to him—the park. The park at
this time of night would be almost empty, and most

important, it would be quiet. He needed solitude this
night. He had to think.

Inside the mind of Marty Dee. The impressions,
ideas and opinions of a professional work dodger and
practicing bohemian —age 26:

“";. . wonder af fF should look fora job =. any
kind of a job... well not any kind ... can’t stand
a noisy place like a factory or warehouse ... don’t
want labor work anyway ... maybe a saleman’s job

ae (00) Jk OO ae beleve that good ...T1
olnene care 1f anybody bought anything or ce
JG) Oey fork soo GUSi who com I GO . . » Reve
thought about it very seriously before ... going to
be twenty-seven in three months . . . no kid anymore

. can’t be playing my part much longer .. . won't
be a ‘“‘misunderstood boy’? anymore... but that
won't be for awhile yet . . . still can pass for twenty-
two or twenty-three... but what about the time
when I won’t be able to . . . and there aren’t any wm-
pressionable young girls to feel sorry for me and go
my rent... or any older women who want to help
“ihe kid’? . . . can’t keep shoplijumg either ~~~ or
playing around with small checks to people that I know
won't prosecute .. . maybe one of them will prosecute
someday ... or I might get caught coming out of a
store with a T. V. or some records and go to jal...
I think I would shrivel up and die a slow death in jal

. I can’t take orders from people and get wp early
every day of the week and go do anything I don’t want
to do... wouldnt last a week... this 1s really
quite a problem... I don’t want to work ...Tf
don’t want to steal . . . and I don’t want to starve . .
there’s got to be a solution ... maybe I could put
my hand on a railroad track and let a train run over
it and collect the insurance money for the rest of my
fe ...no... I wouldn’t have the nerve . . maybe
I could see one of the junkies that hang around the
neighborhood and buy some stuff and then do ut when
I am loaded ...no...TI still wouldn't have the
heart... besides ...I7d be feeling too good to
want to cut off my hand... af I could act or paint
or write ... I could make rt on my talent... man

_ I don’t have anything going for me ... look at
those people walking around smiling and laughing . .
wonder if they mean it . . . I only laugh when I want
to charm someone or when I am high... I haven’t
really loughed... damn... when was the last

tume . . . what is wrong with me anyway .. . maybe
I’m some kind of nut... nothing moves me...I
just want to lay around... that’s all... other

guys go crazy for ball games or women or money or
their work ... they seem to dig life... and dig
