i ae = SUMMER OF 1959

EASTERN ECHO |

As we go on with the story of truth and gustice, we
might remember Carl Sandburg’s form of oath and a witt-

ness s reply:

“Do you solemnly swear before the everliving God that
the testimony you are about to give in this cause shall be the

truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?”

“No, [ dowt. [can tell you what I saw and what I
heard, and Pl swear to that by the everlrving God, but the
more I study about 1t the more sure I am that nobody but the

everliving God knows the whole truth, and
if you summoned Christ as a witness im

this case, what He would tell you would

burn your insides with the pity and the
mystery of wt.”
