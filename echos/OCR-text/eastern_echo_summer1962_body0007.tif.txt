years, a prisoner were refused parole, he would then
be eligible for a parole hearing every year thereafter,
until he had either proven himself rehabilitated, or
until he had served a total of 13 years and 4 months
of his entire sentence. If he had not lost any time
for violations of the Rules and Regulations of the
institution, then, upon having served |3 years and 4
months of his 10 to 20 years sentence, he would
automatically be released and his entire sentence
terminated, because the remaining 6 years and 8
months is the amount of good time he would receive
from his entire sentence.

When a prisoner is received at the penitentiary
he is placed in quarantine, and during the first two
or three weeks there he may quite frequently hear
the word rehabilitation. After curiously inquiring of
this particular subject, the prisoner learns that re-
habilitation consists of improving his mental outlook
in respect to terminating all further indulgence in
criminal activity; melioration of his social attitudes
and pattern of deportment; learning to accept and to
abide by the rules and regulations which govern
society and the institution in which he is confined;
improvement of his education and fulfillment of all
Religious obligations, etc.

The prisoner entered the institution with the im-
pression that he was sent there as punishment, and
being previously confronted with the various incon-
sistencies he begins to wonder if it is possible for him
to be punished and rehabilitated at the identical
time.

Now, after being equipped with the full know-
ledge of the ingredients of rehabilitation, its purposes
and how it is attained, let’s assume that this prisoner
develops a sincere desire to become rehabilitated so
that when he is eventually released, he will be able to
live a normal and respectable, law abiding life.

If, after having served six years of his minimum
sentence of 10 to 20 years, this prisoner has contin-
uously shown sincere evidence of complete rehabil-
itation, is society or this prisoner serving the pur-
poses of rehabilitation by his being kept incarcerated
until he has served those four remaining years of his

10 year MINIMUM sentence?

Iam fully cognizant of the fact that the prisoner
has perpetrated a crime against society and must be
punished for doing so, but the gist is that, even
though this priscner did do wrong, he has repented,
has become completely rehabilitated and has served

By no means am | insinuating that the system
of good time be installed in this State for the sole
purpose of remuneration for rehabilitation. Al-
though technically it could be interpreted that way
in some degree. However, the main purpose for
such a suggestion is made with the thought of giving
a prisoner an opportunity for receiving an early pa-
role if he has shown sincere rehabilitation during his
confinement.

If society throws the ““Book’’ at a person and
completely forgets about him during his immure-
ment, then how can society expect this forgotton
person to show respect towards them and abide by
their rules and regulations when he is eventually
released?

Remember, there are many men who need only
to spend a short period of time incarcerated in
prison before they become completely rehabilitated.
This fact has been proven many times. | must agree
of course, that there are many men in prison who will
never become rehabilitated. However, why make
the rehabilitated prisoners suffer because of the un-

rehabilitated ones?

By now, | imagine that there are many of you
wondering “how can anyone determine when a pris-
oner is completely rehabilitated?’ It is my belief
that psychologists, psychiatrists and others who have
studied human behavior all their lives, can determine
this quite accurately through such means as observing
the prisoner's social attitudes, daily conduct, ex-
pressed beliefs, expressed desires and daily habits,
etc. Therefore, if through such observance, a pris-
oner has shown evidence of complete rehabilitation,
then we must accept as a fact that he is rehabilitated
and yvrant him the opportunity of once more being
accepted by society.

Unfortunately, however, at the present time,
society seems to be primarily concerned only with
the thought and habit of sentencing the majority of
law-violators to as much time in a penitentiary as is
possible and forgetting about them. Whereas, so-
ciety should be making it its duty to see that pris-
oners have advantages available to them for being
released in a sufficient amount of time when they
have shown sincere evidence of complete rehabilita-
tion. Permitting a rehabilitated prisoner to be pa-
roled before his MINIMUM sentence has been com-
pleted, would be beneficial to him and to society in
his adjustment among them when he is released.

Society must be made to understand that it is
much easier to remold a prisoner in the community
