THE FORK IN THE ROAD

For some time, I had been hearing about Judge
James M. Carter, the United States District Court
judge in the San Diego district.

People who are in a position to know had told
me that he had some rather unusual ideas in the field
of criminal law, that he was putting them into prac-
tice, and that I should go down and take a look.

So Sam Hicks and I went down and took a look,
and I’m certainly glad we did.

As a rule, there is a great gap between the think-
ing of the judges who pronounce sentences, on the
one hand, and that of the penologists who must ad-
minister these sentences, on the other.

Time after time, I’ve asked prison wardens,
“How many of the judges who pass sentences on
these prisoners have ever visited your prison to see
what conditions are like or what a prison sentence
means?”

In virtually every instance, I have had the same
reply. “Not one.”

There is a certain peculiarity in the thinking of
legislators and judges. They are prone to think in
terms of five-year multiples.

Many judges passing sentence will say five
years, ten years or twenty-five years. That’s the
way many of the laws are written.

Penologists, on the other hand, tell me that
virtually every prisoner, except the most hardened
inmate, goes through a critical time when punish-
ment has done its work, when the man has come to
recognize the error of his ways, when he’s filled with
remorse and a genuine desire to get out and make
something of himself. It is during this period that
the prisoner should be released.

If a man is released too soon, before remorse has
had an opportunity to do its work, before confine-
ment has had an opportunity to exert a sobering in-
fluence, he’s going to go right back and get into
trouble. If, on the other hand, a man is kept too
long, the period of remorse gives way to a feeling of
bitterness, a hostility toward society. When a pris-
oner is released during that period of bitterness, he’s
pretty apt to go right out and start committing more

crimes. He has become an enemy of society.

These stages vary with the different individual.
Penologists would like very much to see some careful
appraisal of the individual made before sentence is
passed, and penologists would like to have a very
considerable latitude in the time of sentence, so that
men can be released during this critical period when
punishment has done all the good it can do and be-
fore the period of bitterness sets in.

Then, of course, we must remember that one of
the main purposes of punishment is to act as a crime
deterrent, to discourage potential criminals who
might otherwise violate our laws.

There’s a delicate balance here: How much
punishment is enough to act as a deterrent upon
others; how much is needed to cure the individual
of yielding to lawless impulses.

If we make our punishments too little, they are
valueless. If we make them too great, we hamper
rehabilitation.

These are things society must constantly keep in
mind—for its own good.

People who have violated laws are still people,
human beings who react to their experiences.

Too many judges don’t pay enough attention to
the individual prisoner, but only to the statute.
They think, as I have pointed out above, in multiples
of five years. If the prisoner isn’t given five, he’ll
get ten; if not ten, probably fifteen or twenty.

It is almost impossible for a man who enjoys
freedom, with all of its numerous prerogatives, to
realize what it means to be deprived of that freedom.
Perhaps the closest analogy we can get is in the case
of a man who has had to go to a hospital and has
been confined in a room for two or three weeks. He
has only to press a button and a good-looking nurse
comes to find out what he wants. He is given the
best of meals, the best of care. Everything is done
to make him comfortable. Yet, at the end of the
second week, that man would tear the place apart
if his doctor changed the release date and imposed
another two weeks of confinement.

A man in prison has none of the advantages one
