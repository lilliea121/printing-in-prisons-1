MUSIC......

The following paragraphs may be of some
value to those of you who are musically interested, or
who wish to receive a musical foundation, or to fur-
ther their musical education. Because of space prob-
lems, this article will represent just a brief outline of
the ever increasing activities of the Concert Band.
We therefore encourage those who are musically in-
terested to see ‘Jack’ the Band Room clerk on 7th
Block for further details. The “‘Echo”’ staff has
plans for a more elaborate and informative article on
the Concert Band in a future issue of the ‘‘Echo”’

The institution's musical program has taken
a giant stride forward with the acquisition of Mr.
Giacinto Vizoco as Musical Director and Concert
Master. I believe a profile here would be of interest.

Mr. Giacinto Vizoco is a graduate of a Con-
servatory of Music in his native Italy and has an in-
teresting and extensive background of world travel,
including a teaching position in Africa. Since mak-
ing Philadelphia his home, he now conducts several
times a week in the various parks and concert halls
throughout the city, state, and surrounding territories.
A very amiable gentleman, who has shown a pro-
ficiency as a thoroughly qualified and adept teacher.
He is basically a Trombonist and Cornetist, but
devotes his time now to conducting.

As this issue of the ‘‘Echo”’ goes to press, Mr.
Vizoco is limited to twice weekly visits, Monday and
Tuesday evenings. For those of us who are music-
ally interested, we are hoping it will soon be a steady
every-day proposition.

The ‘“‘Dance Orchestra” is in bloom again
after a barrenness of more than three years. The
selections we are playing can possibly be likened to
the pallid ghosts of yester-year, but we are not too
concerned or preoccupied with the vintage or age of
the selections we attempt, for in the laws of tonality,
the most musical and the least musical will find a
common ground of interest, and we are trying to
present them in a way that will give the greatest pos-
sible listening pleasure. Who can deny the pleas-
ures of recalling and having a sentimental reunion
with such nostalgic memory tunes as: Deep Purple,
So Rare, My Blue Heaven, Autumn Leaves and the
unforgetable Stella By Starlight. To be sure, there
is no denying that the old familiar tunes have a sen-
