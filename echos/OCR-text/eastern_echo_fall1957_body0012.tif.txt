Losing @ur
Sense of the Vital

bp Reb. Gordon Repnolds,
Protestant Chaplain

William Hunt, a great artist, was coaching a
class in landscape painting. It was late in the after-
noon and he had suggested the painting of the sun-
set. As the sun was sinking below the horizon, he
looked over the shoulder of one of his most promising
pupils and noticed, to his dismay, that the young
man, instead of painting the glorious sunset, had
spent all his time painting an old red barn with
dilapidated shingles. In great dismay, the famous
artist and teacher exclaimed, ‘‘Son, son, it won’t
be light long. You haven’t time for both shingles
and sunset. You must choose.’’

Too many of us spend days, hours, talents and

Caryll Houselander in Warist Missions recently
wrote, ‘‘If someone with the knowledge to do it
would write a book about the price that gallant men
and women have paid, gladly, to hear Mass all
through the ages, from the time of the catacombs
until now, in all the countries of the world, what an
inspiration that would be! And how it would shame
us when we do not go to Mass simply because it
would mean a little effort, which we are too lazy to

purses, painting old red barns and shingles—the
mundane earthly things of life. We major on the
minor and minor on the major. We putter around
with inconsequentials while our world is on fire.
The night descends; the night when no man can
work. Alerted to the transitory character of the
light let us resolve to splash the sun, the spiritual
things on the canvas of our lives while it is still
light.

Then hope will rise above the bleak and barren
areas of human life, above its scarred lands and
destroyed cities, with healing in its wings.

General MacArthur said, ‘‘You cannot save the
flesh until you save the spirit.’’ When we spend as
much on Bibles as we spend on bombs; as much for
Missionaries as for Marines; as much for Brother-
hood as for battleships; when we are as alive to the
Christian Gospel as the Communist is to spread his
cause; then God will touch our people, individually
and collectively, with the transforming power of the
Christian dynamic. Our trouble—it seems to me—is
that we have been giving ourselves to secondary
things. ‘‘Seek ye first the Kingdom of God and His
righteousness,’’ is a splendid scriptural exhortation,
but for many of us it has been far down the list,
not even a bad second, and the sense of the vital has
been lost. We haven’t time for both shingles and
sunsets!

to walk to Church, since the Chapel is almost within
arm’s reach of everyone. It seems to me that the
Catholic man in the H. 8. P. who does not attend to
this duty, does so for one of two reasons: he does
not stop to consider what the Mass is, or he is a
victim of human respect.

What is the Mass? It is a quick peek at heaven.
We all hope some day to worship Christ as He reigns
in glory at the right hand of the Father. This hap-
piness, however, must wait until we have passed
through the testing years of this life. Meanwhile,
for our consolation and strength, Christ anticipates
our heavenly joy and becomes truly present on the
Altar at every Holy Mass. For a few minutes each
week we are privileged to enjoy heaven on earth.
Think about it and you won’t miss Mass.

The victim of human respect is the fellow who
misses Mass because he is afraid that he will be
taunted on the block when he returns from Mass.
Think of the thousands who in our own day and
through the centuries past have suffered persecu-
tion and even death for assisting at the Holy Saeri-
fice. Do more than admire their fortitude. Imitate
their example and be willing to suffer the persecu-
tion of being ‘‘kidded’’.

In the Middle Ages attendance at Mass was oft-
en spoken of as ‘‘seeing God’’. ‘‘See’’? Him each
week at Holy Mass, so that you may more surely see
Him in the endless weeks of eternity.
