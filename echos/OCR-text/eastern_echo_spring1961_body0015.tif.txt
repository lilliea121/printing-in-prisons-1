earliest Pennsylvania case on point requires that
‘“the insanity be so great as to take from the subject
his freedom of action.’’ And many other similar de-
cisions can be cited. It will be noted that throughout
these there is one common thread: the irresistible
impulse is part of psychosis. A handful of decisions
ean be found which seem to indicate that in an oc-
casional jurisdiction, irresistible impulse by itself
(not as a symptom of insanity) is exculpatory. But
usually there is here an implication that the court
simply assumed, as amatter of course, that the psyco-
sis (insanity) has been established.

It seems clear that when the doctrine was first laid
down, the courts meant that irresistible impulse, if
it excused at all, would be such an impulse as came
out of a diseased (psychotic, insane) mind.

Probably no one wants to hold accountable an in-
sane person who commits an unlawful act under the
compelling imperative of his insanity. Do we need a
special irresistible impulse doctrine to protect such
a person? Or is he adequately protected by the gen-
eral law, including the M’Naghten rule itself?

It seems to me that a person with a definite psy-
chosis (actual insanity) who does an act because of
that insanity, and does it specifically because of a
compulsion rooted in the psychosis, is not acting vol-
untarily. Mens rea means guilty mind, or intent to
commit the act. If there is no mens rea, there is no
crime. Obvious examples would be injuries caused by
movements during convulsions, sleepwalking or
choreiform twitches. In these examples there is no
intent to harm, no mens rea, no crime. Mens rea im-
plies a free and deliberate choice to do wrong: this
surely does not deseribe the compulsive act of a psy-
chotic. Free agency is destroyed by the fabrie of a
psychosis. A sane defendant would be acquitted if he
performed an otherwise unlawful act because of
physical infirmity, convulsion, severe duress, hypno-
tism, sleepwalking or mechanical obstacle. If a sane
defendant is thus excused, presumably and a fortiori
a psychotic person would not be responsible. On these
erounds alone, it seems to me that even in the absence
of a formal irresistible impulse doctrine, a psychotic
defendant is not held accountable by sophisticated
courts when the act was the result of a psychotic de-
lusion.

There is another reason that a psychotic impulse
could lead to an aequittal—though I think this is less
clear cut than the lack of mens rea. That is that the
existence of a psychotic compulsion tends to obliter-
ate any meaningful sense of wrong-doing, hence
should be exculpatory even under the classical ‘‘right
and wrone’’ test.

In some states where, in theory, irresistible im-
pulse is not a defense, courts have admitted the de-
fense in practice. What the courts have done is to
have found that the psychotic impulse overrode judg-
ment, reason, cognition and appreciation of the sense
of wrong. Glueck cites cases from California, Kansas,
Mississippi, Iowa, Texas and West Virginia which re-
flect this. Presumably in these states, a defense of
irresistible impulse would be rejected if the impulse

were of ‘‘neurotie’’ intensity. In discussing this with
me, a southwestern Judge said: ‘‘A mere irresistible
impulse made irresistible on account of Insane frenzy
is a good defense.’’ The phrase ‘‘mere irresistible 1m-
pulse’’ shows a serious underestimate of the potency
of neurotic compulsions. But apparently it is sound
law.

Sir Fitzjames Stephen as far back as 1883 argued
that the M’Naghten rule was broad enough to pro-
tect a psychotically-rooted impulse. Thus, he said:

“The man who cannot control himself is in that
state because he is guided by motives which immedi-
ately press upon his attention. Thus, the power of
self control means a power to attend to distant mo-
tives and general principles and connect them ration-
ally with the act under consideration. A disease
which so weakens the sufferer’s powers as to prevent
him from attending or referring to such considera-
tion, or from connecting the general theory with the
particular fact, deprives him of the power of self
control. How does any one know that an act is wrong
except by comparing it with general rules of conduct
which forbid it? If he is unable to apply such rules,
how is he to know that what he proposes is wrong?
The absence of the power of self control involves an
incapacity of knowing right from wrong. Knowledge
and power are the constituent elements of all volun-
tary action. A man who cannot control himself does
not know the nature cf his acts. A man who does not
know the nature of his acts is incapable of self con-
trol.’’ (Bold mine.)

On this reasoning, as well as through the mens rea
doctrine, one is led to the conclusion that a psychotic
defendant is not, by the traditional M’Naghten rule
and by the general principles of criminal law, respon-
sible for an act which results from a psychotic (in-
sane) irresistible impulse; and that no specifie doc-
trine is needed to spell out such a defense.

2 SYCHONEUROSIS, not psychosis, is the real
battleground over irresistible impulse. Pyro-
mania, for example, in certain sex delinquen-
ies, in neurotically motivated writing of poi-
son pen or obscene letters, in behavior like
sees this, there is, by definition, no insanity. To
the juror, often to the judge, an ‘‘irresponsibility’’
defense is misinterpreted as an ‘‘insanity’’ defense.
(Actually, irresponsibility not insanity is the de-
fense.) If the defense counsel wants his client found
‘‘irresponsible,”’ he tries to get the judge and jury to
think of his emotional state as some species of insan-
ity. An obsessional neurotic is not insane. But the
defense, realizing that it is easier to get an acquit-
tal if the ‘‘psychosis’’ label can be attached, strives
mightily to emphasize the abnormality of the defen-
dant’s emotional state, hinting that it is somehow
akin to insanity. A neurotic in the grip of an irresis-
tible impulse is obviously not in a normal or healthy

state of mind, and the defense effort is to equate an

abnormal or unhealthy mind with an insane one.

With respect to neurotie (that is, sane) impulses,
there are three questions to be answered: (1) do these
impulses really exist? (2) might they lead to violent
