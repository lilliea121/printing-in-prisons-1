and she stared back at him impersonally, without
curiosity or emotion, almost, he reflected, as though
he were a piece of furniture, or didn’t exist at all.
Miss Shorter cleared her throat.

John’s eyes fell to the sample case at his feet.
He felt that he couldn’t stand here any longer with-
out saying or doing something, acting just lke an
oaf from the country, but he felt incapable of speech,
awe-struck and tongue-tied before this famous and
olamourous woman.

He stooped and picked up the sample case,
opening it and searching through it for a gift for
the movie-queen. His fingers closed around a choker-

set; a set of choker, matching bracelet and earrings
which had cost him almost ten dollars wholesale, and
though he knew he really shouldn’t give this to Miss
Shorter because she would be certain to consider it
just plain junk, he seemed to have no control over his
hand, but watched as it picked up the set and extend-
ed it to the movie-queen without hesitation. It seemed
almost as though his hand had life of its own, distinct
from the rest of his body.

Miss Shorter coyly asked, ‘‘For me?’’ and ex-
tended her hand for the gift, raising her eyebrows
just the proper degree. ‘‘ How lovely!’’ she exclaimed,
taking the box from him, examining the set and
quickly handing it to Miss Dodge, who murmured
something complimentary and placed the set on the
dressing table.

Carried away by their exclamations of thanks,
John delved into the case again. ‘‘You’re married,
aren’t you?’’ he asked the actress, his hand poised
over the samples in the case.

“Oh, yes,’’ she admitted.

We cco he mused lis) Jonmme Weis:

muller, isn’t it?’’

“‘No,’’? Miss Shorter answered slowly, and it
seemed to him that she was sorry that she could
not say yes.

‘Sorry,’’ he mumbled, wishing he had spent
more time reading Louella Parsons.

‘‘He’s known as the ‘Figure Divine’,’’ the actress
prompted.

He pounced on the clue. “Oh! I know now.
It’s Buster Crabbe!’’ he pronounced triumphantly.

A look of annoyance crossed the actress’ face
briefly, but she soon flashed the famous smile. ‘‘No,”’
she’said, ““no, it’s Don, Wall.”

‘“Oh, yes, of course,’’ he answered, his mind

racing over the muscular movie idols ticking them
off one by one.

‘‘Silly of me not to have remembered.’’ His
hand closed over a cuff link set, picked it out and gave
it to Miss Shorter.

?

‘Oh, really,’’ she protested, taking the set, “‘you
really shouldn’t do this.’? She smiled down at the
set, an imitation ruby mounted in a gold-filled setting,
and then handed it to her secretary for her approval.

Once again John’s hand dipped into the open
ease, extracting a little book with three-dimensional
pictures. ‘‘Here,’’ he said, “‘perhaps you have a
child,’’ and he placed the book in Miss Shorter’s
hand.

‘“Two,’’ she murmured, almost inaudibly.

His fingers dipped quickly among the few re-
maining samples, searching for something appropriate
for a child, but all he could locate was a novelty yellow
hen, whieh, when pushed from above, discharged
colored marble-eggs.

He handed this to Miss Shorter, demonstrating
how it worked, and she: exclaimed over it as if it
were the most expensive toy ever devised. He stared
around the dressing room, pleased with the effect his
eifts had produced.

‘‘T acted, you know,’’ he said.

‘*Really,’’ Miss Shorter exclaimed politely.

‘““The usual stuff,’’ he explained offhandedly.
‘“A couple of plays in high school, a few years
with The Hightown Theatre Guild here in Philly,
that sort of thine”

‘*Oh,’’ the actress answered, suppressing a yawn.

‘‘T had a chance to do a professional play with
the ~< Children’s Wheatne™ here too, hie went. on,
“but... well, tramkly, my, wale was against: 1h,
She didn’t want me running around the country with

a lot of single girls in the cast, being out on the
road all the time, away from home:”’

Miss Shorter murmured sympathetically.

“‘T’m still interested, in a way,’’ he said, his
eyes looking off into space for a moment, “‘but I
don’t suppose I’ll ever be able to do anything now,
with a family and a living to earn.”

‘Have you ever thought of Hollywood?’’ Miss
Dodge asked.

‘‘Oh, no,’’? he admitted. ‘I couldn’t act that
well. I haven’t had enough experience.’’
