so here I am

Jerry Haas has gone where the grass is truly greener. Echo, being a prison
creature, remains with us. What to do with this featureless monster? make
wallander editor. That’s it!

That’s it, huh!

During the five years that I have been reading Hcho—with only a few
exceptions—this publication has displayed a remarkable agility for avoiding
issues vital to all of us. Well now, I am not so agile. Nor is my inclination
as editor such as to allow me at any time to embrace the specious reasoning
which causes its adherents to always duck, but never oh never toss a punch.

There will be some changes made. I have concocted a simple Echo formula
designed to justify for all minds these changes: The Eastern Echo 1s a journal
primarily expressing inmate views, beliefs, opinions and convictions authored
by inmates in articles on any and all topics germane to his life as prisoner or
free man.

Although the Echo ‘‘writing staff’? (Tommy Williams, Lou McCloud,
Terry Baulkman, Norman Pearson and Frank Rouse) are eager to be heard, all
of us are of one mind in that articles written by inmates, not with staff affilia-
tion, should appear in print more often than has been happening. Indeed, we
are most willing for your articles to shove us right off the pages!

For this to occur it is of course necessary that you submit material for
publication. But first, it is essential that the author be discreet in selecting the
vocabulary to best express his thought. And last, to keep reasonably clear of
the author’s bugaboo—rewrite, I recommend to you this guideline (One which
I shall have in mind as I edit your work.) : It frequently happens that having
one’s name after an article denoting authorship is not an adequate reminder
for the reader that he is reading an opinion, belief, etc., of the author. The
reader may become confused and think he is reading something that is factual,
when what he is doing is reading opinion no matter how learned. So let us
keep our readers aware of what they are reading. It is easily accomplished just
by inserting (where proper) expressions such as: ‘‘In my opinion—,’’or “‘As I
see it—,’’ and ‘‘It seems to me—’’; these and other such identifying terms
serve to keep things nicely organized in our minds. Then too, when using a
quote, make sure the reader knows that someone is being quoted and who that
someone is. Make every effort to note within your article, media from which
quoted material has been extracted.

This brings us to the changes or innovations which will be initiated in the
upcoming Hastern Echo. May I renund all of you, as you read the following,
of the Echo formula as stated above.
