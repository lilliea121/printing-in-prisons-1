Independence Day comes but once a year and,
on this day in 1959, as the familiar “Yard-Out” call
echoed through Ye Olde ESP, local citizens began
to move toward the Recreation Field where a full
day of field events was to have its beginning. As
we glanced from one to another, we could see dis-
plays of emotion,—tenseness, anticipation and hope.
The crowd began to assemble on the field and your
reporters knew that this would be a memorable day,
a day when everyone or anybody could be a winner.

The program began with the Concert Band, un-
der the capable direction of tenor-saxist Jimmie
Jackson, filling the warm morning air with the
spirited strains of John Philip Sousa’s “Stars and
Stripes Forever,” instilling in the crowd the spirit
of the day.

Mr. Graham, Director of Education and Athle-
tics, stepped to the microphone to announce that fol-
lowing the National Anthem the events would get
underway.

We must pay tribute to James “Jimmie” Jack-
son for arranging such a splendid musi¢ program on
such short notice and to the following men who came
willingly at Jimmie’s call:

Reeds: Dupree, Higgins, Chesterfield, John Ag-
new, Geo. Foeman, Jesse Pierce, Al iLyalitne, ROSCOE,
Hinkle and McKenzie.

Brass: Sessions, Jackie Floyd, Juice Cohen, Tri-
enani, Tom White, Locke, Ed Stradling, Henry Up-
shur, Clint Geary and Bill Schoonmaker.

Rhythm: Glenn, Leon Hiers and McGee.

testans in this race, and when the scales were
brought onto the field the field of entrants was cut
