it could hardly have been otherwise.

That means that 19-20ths of our prison inmates will be joining us on the outside from time to time, and
they will join us either as resentful, vengeance-seeking men and women or as reasonably well adjusted

men and women who have been prepared for life within the law.

If imprisonment is designed only to

impose punishment, to exact a pound of flesh, our sadistic appetites may be satisfied but we shall be

creating all sorts of threats to our own safety.

There is no denying that there must be some kind of punishment for crime, at least until we can
figure out a better alternative, if for no other reason than to discourage the offender from repeating

his misdeed and to deter others from emulating him.

Of course, there can be long argument as to the

deterrent value of imprisonment, but until that argument is resolved differently from the way it is
supposed to have been resolved for the present, crime must naturally be followed by punishment.

To deprive a man of his freedom, to bar him from coming and going as he pleases, to restrict his
social contacts almost to the point of nothingness, to subject him to a regimen in which he has no say,
is punishment that cannot be appreciated by those who take freedom in all its forms for granted. To
pile on top of that mistreatment, idleness or completely useless and strictly punitive work, not only is

cruel but it poses additional threats to society.

Imprisonment now has a dual purpose—punishment and rehabilitation. The punishment is automatic
_ it begins for the vast majority of offenders with arrest .. . it continues as long as an offender is denied

his liberty.

Rehabilitation is another matter—it takes a lot of working at, and men like Superintendent

Banmiller are in the vanguard of the enlightened administrators who have mapped and carried out an
elaborate course of training and rehabilitation that goes a long way toward preparing prisoners for life

on the outside.

And the work performed by people like Mrs. Scheer also is part of an effective rehabilitation program
__. it’s the sort of work that any of us can do, if we are interested in all members of God's creation and
if we are interested in the improvement of society in general. “For, inasmuch as ye have done it unto
the least of these My brethren, ye have cone it unto Me.” EY
