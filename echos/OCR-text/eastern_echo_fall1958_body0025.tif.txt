A New Era in Sports

by JOSEPH McNEAIR

With the demolition of the old machine shop,
a new era in sports has begun in ESP.

For the first time in the one-hundred-twenty-
nine-year history of “Cherry Hill,” outside competi-

tion in softball has come within these walls. Also .

original in our history, is the wearing of softball uni-
forms by our teams. These uniforms, caps and
jerseys, were purchased entirely through contribu-
tions of the inmate population.

HISTORY MAKING GAME

On July 12th, the “Cherry Hill Varsity Softball
Team, under the management of Mr. T. H. Graham,
Edueational Director, played host to the MeGEKE-
HAN SOFTBALL TEAM of Mayfair, Phila., a mem-
ber of the Philadelphia Tavern Association.

The Inmate Orchestra, assembled and set-up on
the roof of the tool shed, located in extreme center-
field, intoned the “Star Spangled Banner”, and so
began this historic game.

In the first inning, with George Kalvitis on the
mound for Cherry Hill, the visiting team took ad-
vantage of two walks and three stolen bases to pro-
duce one run.

HANDBALL TOURNAMENT

This year’s Handball Tournament held more
spectator interest than that evidenced in the past.
There were forty contestants to start. When elim-
inations had been concluded, those remaining were
Al Jenkins, last year’s champ, John “The Bear”
Walker, Billy Holmes and Blackie Battles. The
ardent handball fans began to falter and doubt
their favorite’s chance of winning the championship,
especially when “The Bear” eliminated Billy
Holmes, a former Champ. But, alas, Battles elimin-
ated Walker, setting the stage for the final round.

In the championship finals, Battles and Jenkins
brought the crowd to its feet time and time again
with their sparkling play. The first game went to
Jenkins 11-9, the second to Battles 11-8 and the
third and deciding game to Jenkins, 11-5. The win-
ner and still champion, Al Jenkins.
