SOFTBALL

by N. L. HARMAN
Asst. Sports Editor

Well, the Cuban League got off to a_slow start,
with the weather being bad the first two weeks
of the season. Now with the weather beginning to
get nice and more like baseball time should be, the
League promises to show some great and hotly
contested games.

I will attempt to pick the winners, which will
be a rough assignment:

The First Half will go to the DODGERS. With
their great hitting power and their good pitching
led by No-No. J. W. is a good manager.

The FALCONS will have a late start, but will
be tough with their well balanced offense and good
solid defense plus the pitching of Walkie-Talkie
Johnson and Jim Lassiter, should win the Second-
Half and the World Series. Looks like G. I. Joe
has a winner.

The team to watch will be the RAMS, with

their speed on the base paths and their good steady
pitching staff, with Jordan leading the way and
getting great help from Rooster. This team could
surprise everyone. They have a very good and
capable manager in Big Jim Ford.

The BEARS, last year’s winners, will be rough
and in the fight all the way, but the loss of Burns
and Jackson to the Street will leave a gap which
Big Dave will have a hard time filling as it is too
much for even an Iron Man like Dave. Eddie Ruth
has a problem with the team, but being a manager
of the winner shows that he knows the ball game.

In conclusion, I will say that there will be a
lot of shoe leather worn out by the managers
pacing the sidelines, as this race will be hotter than
Hades. No team can afford to give the other even
a small break.

NOTE: A supplementary sports sheet will be
published semi-monthly to keep our readers abreast
of the institution sports activities.
