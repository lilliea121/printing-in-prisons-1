My wife and | spent two and a half hours in prison last night. No, this is not a confession that we ran
afoul of the law and were called to account... we were guests at a ceremony at Eastern State Penitentiary
here in Philadelphia in honor of a very great woman whose life has been a response to one of the great
commandments of the Founder of Christianity.

Honored at Eastern State Penitentiary last night was Mrs. Dorothy W. Scheer of 641 Maris Street,
Philadelphia, who has devoted all her spare time to helping call the public’s attention to the newspapers
and newsmagazines published by the inmates of penal institutions throughout the United States— in fact,
throughout the western hemisphere. By stimulating interest in what is known as the penal press,

Mrs. Scheer has acquainted a great many people with stories of life behind prison walls... she has helped
greatly in the dissemination of news about a very important part of our population, even though that

part of our population is segregated from the rest of society by walls and bars. But perhaps the most
important contribution Mrs. Scheer has made is in convincing the nation’s penal population that somebody
cares about its members, that a great many people care, that they are not forgotten men and women and
that they have a chance to become useful, happy members of free society when their terms have been served.

When | hear of work like that performed by Mrs. Scheer and others who have interested themselves in
the lives of prison inmates, | think of that part of the Gospel of Saint Matthew when Jesus was telling
His disciples of what would happen when, as He said, “The Son of Man shall come into His glory. The
King shall say unto them on His right hand... | was hungered and ye gave Me meat; | was thirsty, and
ye gave Me drink; | was a stranger, and ye took Me in. Naked, and ye clothed Me; | was sick, and ye
visited Me; | was in prison, and ye came unto Me.” Then, according to the story Jesus told, the righteous
asked The King when He had been hungry, thirsty, a stranger, naked, sick and in prison, and The King
answered, “Inasmuch as ye have done it unto the least of these brethren, ye have done it unto Me.”

Of course, there are a great many people who do not agree that any kindness should be shown the men
and women who have run afoul of the law, that they should be punished severely, that they, to use a trite
expression, should be made to pay their debt to society. People like Mrs. Scheer do not dispute the need
for penal institutions at this stage of our civilization, but what they do dispute is the justification for
retention of medieval attitudes toward the inmates of those institutions.

Sharing Mrs. Scheer’s basic views in that respect is William J. Banmiller, superintendent (or warden)
of Eastern State; and, if you think upon this carefully, you might conclude that the debt society owes to
a man like Mr. Banmiller is well nigh incalculable. Banmiller once told me this: “| say a prayer every
night that | may never become cynical and that | may always keep the proper perspective of the ultimate
goal of each prisoner. My aim is to treat prisoners as human beings and to remember that, but for
the grace of God, there go |.”

Banmiller, Mrs. Scheer, others like them believe that every man, wherever he may live, whatever the
conditions of his life may be, is an important human being, a creature of God, and must be treated as »
that highest form of life not as an animal. But there are other compelling reasons for their enlightened
attitude, reasons which perhaps the most vengeful, most vindictive members of our free society—and,
fortunately, they make up a small minority—will understand. The chief reason is found in a very simple
statistic: Ninety-five per cent of the men and women now in prison sooner or later will be released.
