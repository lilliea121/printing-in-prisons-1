Before their coffee arrived, Maxie had already
completed the fabrication of his story. “If he wants
a pusher so bad, VH have to give him one,” he
thought. “But it will have to look good. This cop is
nobody’s fool, and if he even suspects ’m lying to
him, I’m dead—physically and otherwise.”

Sergeant Carter waited until Maxie had taken
two sips of the steaming brew, then reached across
the table. Cigarette, Maxie?”

“Thanks Sarge.” Maxie smiled winninely.

“Listen kid,” Carter began in his soft persuasive
tone, one reserved for informers, “I hope you ain’t
sore about what happened out on the street.”

“T understand, Sergeant,” Maxie replied com-
passionately. “And, like I said, ’m going to help
you. Ain’t that our agreement?”

“Are you ready now?” Carter was anxious.

“Ready for what ?—Oh, ych, the pusher!” Maxie

“Who is he?” Carter was pressing hard.

“Tt ain’t that easy,” Maxie answered warily.

“What do you mean, it ain’t that easy?”

“T don’t know his name or nothing like that.”

“Took, Maxie, if yow’re stalling, so help me I'll
knoek you off that chair.” Carter’s gentle, soft con-
descending tone had disappeared. “Come on, out
with ite Who as, he 27)

“Well...” Maxie was purposefully stalling
now, gathering his thoughts together for the big lie
and wanting it to sound good. “He’s a real skinny
euy, about five-ten. He’s also a real sharp dresser.”
Maxie continued, “Wears Ivy League suits, dark, I
think. And his shoes, Sarge.”

“What about his shoes?”

“They’re yellow, Sarge, yellow and pointy. And
sometimes he wears spats—gray spats.”

“And that ain’t all,” Maxie was beginning to
warm up to this game. “He wears a white shirt with
a tab collar and a tie-pin.”

“What about a hat?” Carter asked.

“Oh, yeh,” Maxie replied, “I almost forgot. He
wears a black Homburg and always carries an um-
brella.”

“An umbrella?” Carter inquired imereduously.

“That’s right, Sarge, he always carries an um-
brella—a black umbrella. That’s where he deals the
Simul: equ,”

“Where can I find this guy?” he asked.

Maxie had forgotten to prepare for this one.
“You'll find him, er, uh—hanging around the corner
of 19th and Lombard. He’s usually there between six
and seven-thirty P.M. on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
That’s about the only place I know where you can
find him.”

“When we get this guy, Pll want you to identify
him,” Carter growled.

“Sure thing,” Maxie replied. “Anything I can
do, I'll be happy to do it, Sarge.”

“O.K., you ean go back to work,” Carter said,
pushing back his chair, standing and preparing to
leave.

“T can? J mean, thanks very much, Sergeant.”

“Give me your check, Maxie, the treat is on me.”

“Gee, thanks,” Maxie answered while handing
over the ten-cent tab, “you’re not such a bad guy
after all.”

Eastern Echo

“Tf you play ball with me, Maxie, you’ll find out
I’m even a better suy.”

“Sergeant,” Maxie began as they stepped to the
sidewalk in front of the restaurant, “I don’t suppose
you would help a guy out?”

“What is it, Maxie?” Carter inquired, a trifle
displeased. He had thought this interview had gone
Omir 2) lott WOO Simeon, “Ike nis Comal yom went, lack
well, you know I don’t have—”

“It aint exactly dough, Sarge. Only sixty
cents.”

“What do you want with sixty cents?” Carter
looked really puzzled.

“Well,” Maxie hesitated, “I got forty cents and
a bottle of ‘terp’ costs a dollar. If you could lend me
sixty cents I could get another bottle.”

The Sergeant laughed. “So yow’re clean, eh. You
junkies are never clean.” He reached into his pocket
and handed Maxie the silver coins. “Now stay out of
center-city, Maxie. I'm warning you.”

“Thanks, Sarce sand Wl do shat stay, aay
from downtown, that is.”

On the: way to make his meet, Maxie chuckled,
picturing the fruitless chase of the stupid copper
looking for a guy dressed like a circus clown.

With the passage of time, a period of two weeks,
Maxie had completely forgotten the incident with
Sergeant Carter—hoping that the detective had for-
gotten about him, also. After all, he did keep his
promise to stay out of center-city.

At about 10 P.M. on a quiet Thursday evening,
Maxie’s telephone rang.

“It’s for you,’ Maxie’s mother said as she en-
tered the living-room.

“Hello?” Maxie mumbled into the phone. “Hello?
Who’s speaking?”

“Hello, Maxie.” The voice sounded vaguely
familiar and irritating to Maxie’s sensitive nerves.
“This is Detective Sergeant Leo Carter!”

“Oh, hi, Sergeant.” Maxie tried to sound casual
but his stomach turned a somersault. “What rates me
a call at this time of night? I know yow’re checking
onme. I told you I’m clean, Sergeant. Not only clean
but sticking close to home. No trouble. No, sir, not
me.”

“Listen, Maxie, we got him.”

“Got who?” Maxie was really lost now.

Oscar,” Carter continued. “That's your guys
name. We picked him up right where you said
we would, and he was dressed exactly like you
described him to me. Even had that goofy umbrella
hanging on his arm—and it wasn’t even raining.”

“Listen, Maxie,” the Sergeant continued, “I’m
sending a car for you, so you can come right down
and identify him. It should be there in a few min-
utes.” Carter paused. “Maxie, I want you to know
I really do appreciate what you have done for me.
We think this ‘Oscar’ is a big time operator. Prob-
ably heads a big ring judging by the stuff we found
ra Initia.”

“And Maxie ... Can you hear me, Maxie?”

But Maxie wasn’t listening and was beyond
hearing. He lay in a fainted heap on the floor.
