only defense was that he was of unsound mind when
the offense was committed. He appealed the case and
the Court of Appeals reversed the decision.

Judge Bazelon in making the reversal said: **The
Jury’s range of inquiry will not be limited to, but
may include, for example, whether an accused, who
suffered from a mental disease or defect did not know
the difference between right and wrong, acted under
the compulsion of an irresistible impulse or had ‘been
deprived of or lost the power of his will. . .’ ”’

‘‘ Juries will continue to make moral judgments,
still operating under the fundamental precedent ‘our
collective conscience does not allow punishment
where it cannot blame’. But in making such judg-
ments they will be guided by wider horizons of knowl-
edge concerning mental life.’’

Again, in brief, it would appear that Judge Baze-
lon, like Judges Sobeloff, Doe, and Briggs, contends
that psychiatry, as any other science, can and does
make mistakes. What may be recognized as fact to-
day may be in error tomorrow. This at first glance
may seem an arguing point for the exponents of the
MeNaughten rule, who insist that ruling is as good as
any and perhaps better than some. They feel that a
jury will exercise its own judgment in situations
where the McNaughten ruling is used. Then even
though the defendant may appear and be guilty ac-
cording to the ruling, the jury,—if it has detected a
mental deficiency in the defendant—will find him not
responsible. This supposition is deseredited by the
following report of a survey :

‘During the period 1931-1941, one out of every 42
felons sentenced to the Eastern State Penitentiary in
Philadelphia was mentally disordered to a commit-
table degree or developed such a condition. Many
such individuals were probably psychotic on admis-
sion to the penitentiary and likely so at the time of
their trial and sentence, but none presented a defense
of insanity. This group represented a limited order
of psychiatric screening and segregation from
the general prison population which otherwise
abounded in unexplored mental disorder. The record
of 287 such mentally disordered prisoners indicates

that only in exceptional instances did the trial court '

take cognizance that the accused was a mental sus-
pect, when in fact one out of every four of the group
had an available documented history of mental illness
prior to last arrest. This group accounted for 199
crimes against the person, of which 47 were homicide
and 42 sex offenses. The group had engaged law en-
forcement agencies and the resources of the taxpayer
to the extent of 1,503 arrests, 964 convictions, and 20
parole violations. The offenders’ average age upon
last conviction was 30, indicating the potentiality for
future social danger. These cases had an average rec-

Eastern Echo

ord of five arrests and three convictions. Summary
reflections of this sampling lead to the disquieting
realization that in each case the court overlooked at
least five chances to find out the kind of person with
whom it was dealing, that by omission, each offender
was given other opportunities for crime, including
murder, and that not until the mental disturbance
had attained such flagrant appearance and threat did
the court finally meet the problem realistically.’’

The major problem in adopting new legislation for
the trial procedure in the cases of mental defects is
the fear of arousing public displeasure. Since the
only type of compulsive crime that is given wide
publicity is the rape—murder, the people have come
to classify all cases of irresistible impulse in that
catagory. Actually these cases are a small minority
and in a number of instances, proper recognition at
an earlier date would have circumvented the rape-
murder.

But the public apparently feels a man committed
to an institution will only remain there a few months
and be released. It is a matter of fact that those men
referred to hospital or asylum for treatment may and
frequently do, more ‘‘time,’’ than those committed
to penal institutions. The reasons for this are obvious.
Our penal institutions are overcrowded and proper
psychiatric diagnoses for parole hearings are an im-
possibility. Yet a man is entitled to parole if he has
an exemplary prison record, a record which most
compulsive criminals possess. Even in those cases
where a diseased mind is uncovered there is no other
alternative than release when the maximum sentence
has expired.

But, when a defendant is committed to an institu-
tion, for treatment, his release has,—in most cases,—
to be approved by a board of trained psychiatrists.
These men are not going to jeopardize their reputa-
tions or the public by signing a release until they are
sure the urge to surrender to impulse has been con-
quered.

The people of a state owe it to themselves, their
children, and those with mental disease to adopt
legislation that will be in keeping with the advances
we have made in criminal psychiatry. To ignore
the problem or try to continue on the path we are
traveling will only lead to more banner headlines,
mutilated bodies and destroyed property.
