to many irrational views by those who were pri-
marily seated in order to have the public’s interest
at heart. Consequently they try all sorts of political
and criminal dodges in order to circumvent or still
any dissenting voice.

It is these very same public officials who give
vent to their rage by calmly looking on or away
while peaceful protesters are beaten and jailed by
the overzealousness of our law enforcement agents.

On the other hand the most dangerous individual
has not been mentioned. This is the average citizen
who display apathy and indifference to any problem,
except the everyday worries of natural problems
such as food, clothing, ete. They have the impression
that unless a problem affects them personally, in-
volvement is a useless course of action. Never real-
izing that the injustice that affects one can surround
many. Our system of government was designed to
affect the masses. Whether the result be good or

bad is for the people to decide.

The culture and ideas of the western world have
indeed shown results, but it has weaknesses which
are beginning to manifest itself in the form of men-
tal lethargy. As the problems of man’s immediate
needs become greater, his interest in national policies
and issues wanes.

What can we do to re-stimulate this interest and
bring it to the forefront of our awareness. A political
scientist once answered this question in five words.
“We must begin thinking again.” It seems to many
people an ordeal to think. The pain of learning and
thinking seems to lie in our habit of shunning the
multifarious problems that confronts us and affects
us each day. The health of a nation depends on di-
verse views and the selection of that which is most
agreeable to life; not as an individual but as a so-
ciety, living and working \together to protect the
rights of all its people.

Pennsylvania, Get In Step!

by Milton Bowers

In a recent issue of The Forum, an inmate publica-
tion at Lincoln, Nebraska, a news item was published
concerning the inauguration of a program by the
Wisconsin Bureau of Corrections. It noted that each
administrative staff at each prison under their juris-
diction, were vested with the authority to recom-
mend an inmate for release on parole at any time
prior to the expiration of his minimum sentence;
when in their judgment the inmate has evidenced
marked strides toward sclf-improvement, and has
reached in all respects some semblance of
rehabilitation.

The premise here is that when a prisoner, in the
opinion of the prison administrative staff, has reach-
ed the pinnacle of rehabilitation a recommendation
is made by them to the Board of Parole urging that
the inmate in question be released on parole at that
pricise juncture. The rationale is that; continued in-
earceration beyond that plateau could very well
work to the detriment of the prisoner should he be
compelled to languish in prison solely through the
mere expedient of satisfying a judicial pronounee-
ment.

The Wisconsin Bureau of Corrections recognized
the fallacy and short-comings of the imposition of
the “minimum-maximum” sentence practiced by the
courts. They, therefore, initiated steps to implement
a “new idea” that would better serve the ends of
justice by focusing its penological philosophy into
the area of “rehabilitation” rather than ‘‘punish-
ment,” thereby significantly rendering obsolete the
theory that punishment for wrongdoing is the means
to an end. And, that by its very existence, punish-
ment acting as a deterrent to crime has been eate-
gorically rejected in this “enlightened” day and age
as being anachronistic.

New concepts in the field of penology are being
tried in many prison systems throughout America.
The Federal Department of Prisons has instituted a
program in all federal prisons that allows hundreds
of prisoners to hold outside employment by day, re-
porting back to the prison after each day of labor.
The money these inmates earn is sent to their fam-
ilies, or to pay off debts incurred. In an article by
Frank McGill (Evening Bulletin, December 17, 1966)
concerning this federal program, he reported that
