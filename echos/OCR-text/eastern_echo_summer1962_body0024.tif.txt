by Francis Murphy

Most of the nations penal institutions have an in-
side hook-up for radio programs that originate in
the prison. These programs are directed at and
are intended for (excuse the expression) enjoyment
by the prison population. Each weekly program
has an inmate, laughingly referred to asa “D J” or

I walk in danger, for | am a prison Disc Jockey.
Seated here in the partial safety of my cell (way

tions of the various recordings out over the air waves
into all the little and not so little shell-like ears that
are wiggleing in anticipation in the cells that sur-
round us.

When we begin we are certain of the frame of
mind of our captive audience, they all have one thing
in common, they want to go home and to h...... with
everything and prison Disc Jockeys in particular.
