THIS I BELIEVE by HARRY ZIETZ

Every man, whether free or in prison, has a be-
lief, whether it be a belief in a dream or a belief in
reality. HARRY ZIETZ, has no dream to believe in.
His thoughts are expressed in the following words.

?

“‘T believe,’’ says Harry, ‘‘that the basic dif-
ference between men is not so much their ignorance
of each other’s character and personality, but the
clash of wills and desires.’’ Harry goes on to say,
‘‘Man, for all his weaknesses and mistakes is free to
choose the righteous course; and that, by recognition
of his soul’s freedom, he gains the knowledge that
he can fight through and win.’’

BUB, YOU IS JINXED!

MIKE and said, ‘‘Boy, ean you tell me what’s wrong
with my game?’’ “Bub’’ Mike said, “‘the trouble
with you is, you is jinxed.’’—By whom???

SLEEPY TIME BOY

It happened in Milwaukee, last October. An
ambulance screamed to a halt in the center of heavily
traveled main street. Attendants hurried to a tiny,
motionless figure inert on the pavement. <A swift
examination followed. The diagnosis? One two-
year old boy overcome by the sandman.

A STEP AHEAD

In past administrations, it was the custom, that
when a man received a commutation of sentence, he
was released into the world without any idea of what
he was stepping into. It was a cold and strange free
world, and sometime, a terrifying world.

Recently inaugurated by the present administra-
tion is the practice of allowing commuted men daily
walks around the outside of ESP. What better way
is there of gradually conditioning these men for final
melease. SNOOERY Says, its a step ithe melt

ANOTHER FIRST—via McNEAIR & TOBIN

Tuesday night, April 8, 1958, a banquet was held
in honor of the Hastern League basketball players
here at the Eastern State Penitentiary. The affair
was made possible by Superintendent William J.
Banmiller and his staff.

After dinner, (steak, french fried potatoes,
green peas, steamed rice and onion gravy, bread and
butter, cream cheese, pie, coffee and milk, was
served) Mr. Banmiller, in a short address, stated
that in the future a banquet will be forthcoming,
bigger and more elaborate each year—probably in
December—for all of those who participate in organ-
ized sports in the institution.

Mr. Graham, Athletic and Educational Director,
supervised the operation of the movie projector by
Herb Elliott. The reel was of professional basket-

- ball and it depicted highlight plays of teams in the

National Basketball Association.

The management of the Philadelphia Warriors
made the showing of the film possible.

PREDICTIONS OF THINGS TO COME

Two items relating to the messhall fall into
Snoopy’s column of predictions for this issue. Num-
ber one prediction is; Radio speakers will be set up
in the mess halls providing music during meals .. .
Prediction number two; Signs will be posted above
the tray carts asking all inmates not to waste food,
signs will also say, “TAKH ONLY AS MUCH FOOD
AS VOU ANGHIAI 2

The Philadelphia INQUIRER, a notorious anti-
commutation and anti-parole newspaper, will finally
admit, that prisoners can, and are being rehabili-
tated ... A class in television and radio will soon be
set up. This will prove to be the most popular voca-
tional class in ESP... In place of loud speakers,
there will be a ear-phone hook-up for listening to
T.V. programs ... Apples and oranges will be sold
through the commissary this summer... As soon as
the old maintenance building is razed and ground
cleared, arrangements will be made to have outside
competition for softball games. EG}
