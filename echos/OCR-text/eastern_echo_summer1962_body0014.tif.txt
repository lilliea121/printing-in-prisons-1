years is not a future..__.. regardless of what you may have heard or thought
this is where the next hold-up is planned....not all are released with shining halos
_..prominently displayed....or you plan a new and better life for yourself...
try to plan it that way............ lights ouf at ten p.m.....zero hour to let the curtain
down....true feelings emerge in the fri¢éndly darkness of your concrete bedroo

major planets gliding in orbit....you lay on your bed..no one to fool but yourself
ee you take a deep breath.._.its dark..
