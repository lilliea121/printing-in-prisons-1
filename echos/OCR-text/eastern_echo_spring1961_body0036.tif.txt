few the participants, was covered by the Echo. He also men-
tioned that in the interest of furthering their journalistic activi-
ties these two men had forsaken night T.V. to attend classes in
English. Both men are deserving of the praise given them.

Several movies were scheduled to be shown after the festivities
but were postponed because of the time factor. Despite this,
those present agreed that it was one of the brighter moments in
the sports program and gave every indication that new interest
in sports was being aroused.

Dominated by the Lynx for the past several seasons, the Store-
house League is looking forward to a real dogfight for top
honors this year. Owner George Sanders predicts his ‘‘Car-
dinals’’ will be home free when the season is finally over, but
Harry Taylor figures his ‘‘ Rangers’? will have a lot to say about
that. Two new team owners, John ‘‘Gunsmcke’’ Pisieczko
and David L. Valimont aren’t saying much, but each wear
a confident smile. With so many untried players on hand,
this reported will shy away from making predictions and just
give a brief glance ae each teams strength and weaknesses, i
alphabetical order.

THE CARDINALS—George Sanders, Owner
George Miketish, Manager
Barney Wagner, Captain

Only four men seem to be sure of starting berths on the Card-
inals, which means that Little Miketish is planning to keep
moving his players around until he finds the right man for each
position. Big Shakey Young definitely nailed down the second
base sack, while Haymen seems secure behind the plate. Peewee
has been elected to play the hot ‘‘shot’’ corner and an old pro,
Big Mack Averrette, will probably alternate between first and
third, depending where he is needed the most.

Miketish, a thirty game winner last year, will handle the
pitching chores with Johnny Downs coming from the bullpen
when needed. Dupree, LaRue and Billy Holley will give the
Cards the best hit and run combo in the league. Nick, Bob Smith,
Don Allen, Raymond Hooks, and Frank Wysock are all figuring
on being in the starting lineup on opening day, so no one’s job
is actually sewed up. The only apparent weakness that the
Cards may have is that of having to bench so many good players,
but Mac, Barney, and George should have enough experience to
soothe any hurt feelings.

THE COLTS—John (Gunsmoke) Pisieczko, Owner
Herb Elbot, Manager
Wiliam Harvey, Captain
A lightweight team at the plate, the Colts are locking toward
hustle on the field to win games. Manager Elliot is hoping
that his starting pitchers, Jose Walls and Tennessee Mahaffey
will be the impetus that pushes his team to the top. Behind the
pate, team captain Bill Harvey will have his hands full as both
hurlers throw nothing but fireballs. An air-tight infield will
feature Rabbi at first base, Bob Yurkin at second and Jim
Fisher at third. Elliot will play short-stop and manage from
the field, a tough job to handle. The outfield will see a couple
of new men as George ‘‘ Dynamite’? McFeat and Stanley Gold-
stein take to Easterns baseball diamonds for the first time.
McFeat makes no secret of the fact that he will be shooting
for Rookie of the Year Honors and he has potential to be top
contender for that crown. Jimmy Agnew will play left field
while Gunsmoke and Rags Beiland will keep their explosive
bats handy for pinch-hitting roles. In the bullpen, Johnny
Sparango and George P. Davis are two valuable firemen when
it comes time to put out a hot enemy rally.
THE PHILLIES—David L. Valimont, Owner
George Futch, Manager
Owner Valimont has signed up a record crop of rookies and
has a number of veterans on hand for the Phillies’ opening day
game. The question is, will he be able to salvage ten starters
from these players the other teams overlooked. The clubs
strength and weaknesses are both located on the mound where
John ‘‘Lucky’’ DeFelica is the only experienced man. In con-
trast to this situation is the problem of too many players on

o4

second base. Chici, Bob MceGrogan and Elmer Register all lay
claim to the job. Don Ferguson appears to have the starting
berth at first but two men, Marlin Goldsmith and Barney Kelly
are seeking to play third. An old-timer, Champ, has volunteered
for the ‘‘suicide’’ corner but again there will be a struggle as
three players, Bob Pennel, Whit Rosenzweig, and Billy Archy
all seek honors at short stop. In the outfield, Futch will start
Harry Schwediz in center, and alternate Paul Rhine and John
McCandlezs with Bill Gardner and Tennessee Matthews in the
other two positions. Behind the plate, John Kennedy and Herb
Ellsworth will share catching duties. In the bullpen a lot of
games will ride on Frank Sisaks, ability to relieve when needed.

THE RANGHURS—Harry Taylor, Owner
William Williams, Manager

Out to give the other teams a hard time, Taylor has signed up
several men who have a heavy stick at the plate. Elijah Shepard,
Prank ‘Rico’ Darrah and Lucky Jackson will be the mainstay of
will the team in both batting and fielding. With talent like
Joseph MecEroy, Ted Higgins, and Martin Harris to work in the
infield, Taylors cnly worry will be the cow pastures. Wesly
Jacksen, James Moss, and Dennis Short may be the trio to
remedy that ill. Presiding for infield positions, John Agnew
Elmer Mickens, Clarence Adams, and Bob Smith will have
plenty of opportunities to show there wares as spring training
will start a few weeks earlier than usual. Cleve Brown is the
only pitcher on the Ranger’s roster, so this may be the teams
weak point unless they can work the schedule to allow Cleve a
little rest between games. Charles Johnson and Roy Hairston
will stand by for utility purposes and are expected to provide
a lot of help in pinch-hitting situations,

With all players declared free agents at the end of the last
season there was a wild scramble to sign up the stars and a lot
of hard working utility men were totally ignored. This may
prove disasterous to some of the teams as to many individual
stars can sometimes hurt a teams chances if they become tem-
peramental. However, all indications point to a tough season
and a possible race down to the wire.

The managers themselves have little hesitation when it comes
to picking the winner of the league crown. Francis Murphy as-
sures everyone that his Detroit Tigers will roar their way to the
top, while Johnny Robinson refuses to believe that anyone will
beat his Faleons, last year’s champs are conceding nothing and
Manager Dave Croxton has reserved room for another trophy
in his cell.

Looking over the teams we have to start with the best of last
years four, Dave Croxton’s Giants.

THE GIANTS—Dave Croxton, Owner

The power behind this team is located on the pitching found
where Dave ‘Tron-Man’ Wilder is still terrorizing batters with
his bullet like whip pitch. Backing up Dave, Earl Brown has
speed and a change of pace to confuse and befuddle opposition
hitters. First base will see Charley Whiting a good defensive
player while C. Holland has taken command of the second sack.
A perennial favorite of the crowd, Jake Buck is back at third
and Croxton himself will round out the infield by playing short-
stop. H. Powe’l will be on hand to take over at either second or
short if needed. In the outfield swiftness of foot is the keynote
with William Samgon in center, T. White in right field and C.
Thornton playing the left field line. Junior Creditt will call the
signals from behind the plate, while Eddy Whelan will roam in
short field.

THE DETROIT TIGERS—Francis McLaughlin, Owner
Francis Murphy, Manager

Lured from retirement to manage, Murphy has decided to go
all out and will start the season in right field. With Murph’ its
either a home run or nothing so opposing pitchers take notice.
Franny McLaughlin will hold down the initial sack despite the
handicap of a bad arm. At shortstop, Freddy Adams was called
up from the Storehouse League where he proved to be one of the
best defensive men in the jail. William Perry is capable of
