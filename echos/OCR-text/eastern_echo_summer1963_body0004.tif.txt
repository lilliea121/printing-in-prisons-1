If a football were kicked around on a football field as much as the word “Re-
habilitation” is kicked around a prison, the football would be as flat as water on a
board. Rehabilitation is an intangible thing that cannot be measured with a yardstick;
that cannot be seen, yet must be felt by each individual as he approaches his release

date or the future will not hold too much in store for him.

It is easy for us to say: “I’ve adjusted to the program.” You do not have to tell
this to anyone close to you. If the program has done anything for you, the other people
will be the first to notice the change in you. This change will not be in your physical
appearance but will be shown in your attitude toward your fellow man, in your outlook

on life and in your future adjustment in society.

Let’s place the emphasis where it belongs and have rehabilitation come from

the heart and not from a lot of idle talk.
