sentenced; to the correctional institution in which
the applicant was or is confined in order to obtain
expressions of opinion as to the merits of the appli-
cation; and to the Board of Parole for its investiga-
tion.

Thus, at the time of the hearing the Board

regarding the applicant:

with the applicant’s home, job, and sponsor; (2)

avplicant has stated in the application and what
appears from court testimony; (6) the applicant’s
prior criminal record, if any; (7) a list of accom-
plices, sentences, places of confinement, if any.

In general, the application for commutation and
its contents is available to the Board of Pardons for
their study several days before the opening hearing.
The Board conducts hearings during ten months of
each year, and an application is generally acted upon
and presented to the Governor for his consideration
within two months after the hearing of the ease.

All hearings are public and are held either in
Harrisburg at the State Capitol Building, in Phila-
delphia at the State Office Building, or in Pittsburgh
at the City-County Building, except that upon due
notice hearings may be held in such other places as
the Board may designate. When John Doe’s ease is
heard, fifteen minutes will be allowed to his repre-
sentative (relative, friend, or attorney) to speak for

Eastern Echo

him in front of the Board members. In ease he does
not have any such persons available to represent him,
the Director of Parole, after a personal interview
with the applicant, will speak for him at the hearing,
as well as present the facts of the case as taken from
the institutional summary.

The Board may also request any person, inelud-
ing a present or former district attorney and any
official, to appear at the public hearing as a witness
in addition to other persons voluntarily arguing for
or against the prisoner’s application.

Although fifteen minutes is allowed each:side to
present their case for or against the application, in
practice it has been found that a layman or parole
officer arguing on behalf of the prisoner usually takes
about two or three minutes to present his ease; a
minister or lawyer, or a district attorney opposing
the application uses approximately five minutes.

The Board has all public hearings transcribed
and filed with the Secretary of the Board of Pardons.
The transeript of the hearing is then open for inspec-

tion by the applicant or his representative and by
the publie.

After the public hearing an executive session is
held during which the participating Board members
come to final decision regarding the reeommedation
they shall make to the Governor. Three votes in fav-
or of an application for clemency are necessary be-
fore the Board can recommend favorable action by
the Governor. If such is recommended, it is accom-

panied by a statement of the Board’s reasons for its
recommendation.

The Governor may approve or disapprove of the
Board’s favorable recommendation. When the notice
of his action is received by the Secretary of the Board
of Pardons, the Secretary makes a public announce-
ment of the Board’s and Governor’s actions as soon
as practicable. If the Governor approves of the
Board’s favorable recommendation, John Doe re-
eeives a Warrant of Commutation with the Gov-
ernor’s signature and the Seal of the Commonwealth.
This ends his connections with the procedures of the
Board of Pardons, and he is now eligible to appear
in front of the Parole Board.

The Parole Board may or may not release John
Doe after due examination of his case. However,
usual practice has dictated that the Board of Parole
accept the rather thorough investigation and sub-
sequent recommedation of the Board of Pardons, and
that they release the man on parole.

It is hoped that those readers formerly un-
acquainted with the involved processes of commuta-
tion will have found this article a helpful guide and
introduction to the more personalized and perhaps
more interesting opinions on this subject which may
be found on the following pages. —THE END
