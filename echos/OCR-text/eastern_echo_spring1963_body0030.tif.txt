This type of work is not a passing fancy with
Bernie. He began rather early in life when he ac-
cepted a position to manage a recreation center and
athletic club for the youngsters, and as time went
by he was called on many times in counselling the
youth of that era. Always congenial, with that price-
less and easy sense of communication which comes
from informality, his philanthropies have spread
from central city to secluded suburbs and have be-
come a perpetual part of his everyday life.

As he grows older, the urge to help people also
grows within him and it will never subside. Only
recently, as he was leaving the institution after one
of his many visits, he was overheard saying, “I love
this work and I cannot wait until the day | retire from
active business life because then I can devote all my
time to it.”

If it were possible to view his life in photographic
sequence it would be an endless panorama of good

deeds performed totally from the goodness of his
heart, with not one single thought of retribution.

Aside from his many private endeavors, which
for the most part are behind the scene, Bernie's pub-
lic life is also closely associated with charitable work.
His resourcefulness and versatility have found ex-
pression in his extra-curricular activities and his in-
fluence is felt throughout the many organizations and
business groups with which he is identified. He is a
member of the Federation of Jewish Charities, a lay-
man of the Jewish Chaplain’s Service and an ardent
fund raiser for the Allied Jewish Appeal. In Decem-
ber of 1962 Bernie was appointed to serve as Vice
Chairman of the Allied Jewish Appeal’s Metropoli-
tan Division, Region |. This organization, in con-
junction with the Federation of Jewish Agencies,
raised 4.9 million dollars for charitable distribution
throughout the world in 1962.

Mr. Bernard Watman is a man of whom his family
and friends are immensely proud. He is a man for
the needy and under-privileged to be thankful for,
and he is a man who greatly typifies the BROTHER-
LY LOVE which is so much a part of him and the
City of Philadelphia.

Question: “Do you think that this in-
stitution should be torn down? Why ?”’

Answer: No! With reservations, be-
cause it’s not being used in the way it
should be. It should be used as a Class-
ification and Diagnostic center and also
for the inmates who need therapy of

one sort or another.

Richard McClintic

Answer: No! Because this is the type
of institution that can be used as a
treatment center for the sick and men-
tally retarded, as well as a Classifica-
tion and Diagnostic Center. I think
that it should be remodeled within,
rather than torn down. There should

a great loss to the city of Philadelphia.
I think that the cost of building a new

red and prejudices. Philadelphia cer-
tainly needs such a hospital in addi-
tion to its present facilities.

Another, more modern prison should
be built elsewhere—outside the city—
where there is a healthier climate and
environment. It should contain all the
necessary facilities of modern penology
that are lacking here to rehabilitate the
inmates who someday will return to so-
ciety as useful citizens.

Answer: Yes. | believe that to carry
out a successful program of rehabilita-
tion, it must be done in more modern
surroundings. I think this institution
should be replaced section by section,
with more concern given to a modern
school system and a hospital block. I
cannot see how a man can make any

be a more standard and stabilized work
and educational program, better living
quarters, better recreational and medi-
cal facilities, as well as better eating
facilities.

Rob Watson
Answer: No! Rather than destroy this

institution, I think it should be remodel-
ed. Because, if destroyed, it would be

28

penal institution would, by far, exceed
the cost of remodeling this one.

Andrew Collins

Answer: It is my honest evaluation that
this institution should not be torn down
because it is of a strong and stable con-
struction. It should be renovated and
used as a maximum security hospital
for the mentally ill, who are growing
in number because of wars, racial hat-

progress in changing his pattern of
living and thought when he is continu-
ally surrounded by a dull, dreary and
ancient atmosphere.

With a new and modern prison, plus
a program outlined for a man when
he comes out of E.D.C.C., I believe that
it would be a big step in the right di-
rection.
