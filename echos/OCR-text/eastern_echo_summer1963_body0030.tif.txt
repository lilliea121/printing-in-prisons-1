Pearson disposed of his opponent early

In second place with a 10-2 score
and 63 Tie Breaking Points was Martin
J. Pearson (last season’s Champion.)

The 1962-63 Championship went to
Thomas Williams who posted a 10-2
score with 64 Tie Breaking Points.
Thomas finally achieved a long ambi-
tion. He always has been one of our
top players, but Ist place constantly

eluded him till now.

noteworthy performances

The Phila.
ments ended in the same fouled up
condition that marked the start. There
was a two month delay before play
finally began and by the end of May
the final results still weren't clear due

City League Tourna-

to postponements, forfeits and drop-

outs.

Our Industrial Team definitely fin-
ished in 3rd Place with 5 Wins (3 of
them forfeits), 3 Losses and 2 Draws.
However, the Official Scorekeeper has
only credited us with 3 Wins, 3 Losses
and 4 Draws. This situation will be
remedied as soon as he can be con-
tacted.

The Reserve Team finished with 5
Wins, 2 Draws and 4 Losses, with their
final position still in doubt pending
completion of other matches. One
victory, against Univ. of Penna., was
taken away from us because the Uni-

versity dropped from the tournament.

The Championship Team suffered
through the worst season ever, winning
3 matches (2 by forfeit) and losing 6
matches. Most of the losses were very
close, with one point meaning the dif-
and defeat.
Several clubs, notably Post #396,
Univ. of Penna., and the Pawn Club,

never before left here victorious, but

fence between victory

did so this season.

We promise you that next season
the ESP Chess Club will once again
attain the excellent status of previous

seasons.
