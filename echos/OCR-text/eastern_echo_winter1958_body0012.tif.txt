TO THE PEOPLE OF PENNSYLVANIA:

SOME THINGS TO THINK ABOUT

PREJUDICED JURIES

Sharp criticism from three U.S. Circuit Court
judges points up a practice in Pennsylvania State
Criminal court trials of turning over to juries pre-
vious criminal records of defendants in murder cases,
before the juries reach their verdict of guilt or inno-
cence. The practice is highly questionable.

It came before the Cireuit Court bench on the
appeal of man convicted of first degree murder in
a saloon shooting in 1949, and condemned to death.

Judge Albert B. Maris and Judge Herbert F’.
Goodrich, in a majority opinion, for other reasons,
refused to set aside or intervene in the conviction.
Judge William H. Hastie, in a separate opinion,
spoke forcefully against the Pennsylvania Court’s
method of informing juries of criminal records of a
man on trial, remarking that if he were Governor
of this State he would commute the condemned
man’s sentence to life imprisonment.

Judges Maris and Goodrich likewise attacked
the system, suggesting “it would be very much bet-
ter... to permit the jury to consider first the guilt
of the accused; then, after rendering a verdict of
guilt, to receive evidence and consider a second ver-
dict on the question of penalty.”

In view of the strong possibilities of prejudicing
a jury in a capital case the logic of these suggestions
seems unaswerable and the practice clearly ought
to be reformed, either by the Courts or, if necessary,
the Legislature.

DISPARITY OF SENTENCES

A university law professor has called for estab-
lishment of legal procedures to review criminal sen-
tences.

“The United States is the only country in the
world with a highly-developed legal system that
leaves sentencing entirely in the hands of one
judge,” Professor B. James George Jr., said.

Judge F. Ryan Duffy of the U. 8. Court of Ap-
peals has called the disparity of sentences handed
out by courts “shocking.”

Duffy cited the case of an inmate who is serving
one year for theft while another in the same prison
is serving seven for the same offense.

ANSWER TO PAROLE VIOLATIONS
Just give the prisoner that is released on pa-
role half a chance out there and let him live like

other people. Why send him back to prison for
petty offenses that would not even warrant a jail

sentence, much less prison, for an honest citizen?
Cut the long maximum sentences so that they will
not live in perpetual fear of being returned to pris:
on for 10 or 15 years. Let the minimum sentence
become the maximum sentence on parole. Finally,
cut out the practice of imposing endless sentences
in the first place. If these suggestions are followed,
repeated violations will become a thing of the past
and everybody concerned will benefit in the long run.

GOOD TIME FOR PRISONERS

Jackson, Michigan.—Senator Haskell L. Nichols
(Rt) said last week he believed prison inmates should
be awarded good time allowances, resulting in ear-
her paroles, for donating blood to the Red Cross, or
for taking part in any medical or scientific research.

“Prison Inmates have been very helpful on
blood programs and it seems to me that they should
be rewarded with special good time allowance for
their efforts,” Senator Nichols said.

“The objective of such a bill would be to recog-
nize a very good public service, even though the men
are in there for punishment.”

UNINFORMED PUBLIC

From time to time there is criticism from unin-
formed sources that our prisons are not harsh enough
—that our prisoners are coddled—that there is not
enough toughness shown toward our prisoners, many
of you wholeheartedly, agree with this criticism.
Loss of freedom and confinement is in itself a tough
enough punishment.

Philadelphia Inquirer, August 29, 1958—Firmer
treatment of inmates in the city’s prisons and an
elimination of “coddling” was recommended by the
Philadelphia August Grand Jury.

The Grand Jury also stated, “Money spent on
neuropsychiatric treatment for aged patients and
for ‘hardened criminals’ and ‘hardened teen-agers’
is wasted.”

The jury, in a presentation handed up the above
to Judge Byron A. Milnor. The jury in its 19 days
of work considered 1233 bills of indictment.

What is a “hardened adult criminal?”

What is a “hardened teen-age criminal?”

Is money wasted, when it is spent in treatment
of aged patients?

Is money wasted, when it is used to rehabilitate
a man, to make him a better man, to return him to

his family and community; to be accepted once again
by society?
