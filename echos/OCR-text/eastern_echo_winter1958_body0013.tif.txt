HARDENED CRIMINALS?? ARE THEY?

GEORGETOWN, KY.—La Grange inmates give
$102 for tot’s heart surgery.

“It’s the greatest thing I ever heard of. It
proves there is good in everyone.”

So said Mrs. James Covington. Mrs. Covington
is the mother of a 22-month old boy. Her son has a
hole in his heart, and only an operation can save the
child.

ANN ARBOR, MICH.—Seven Southern Mich-
igan inmates answer appeal for help.

A baby girl in Ann Arbor, Michigan, may sur-
vive a serious heart operation she underwent this
week in the University of Michigan Hospital, thanks
to seven inmates of SMP.

The surgery had to be performed immediately
and a rare blood type was required—B negative.

The seven convicts, in their prison garb and
wearing handcuffs were taken to Ann Arbor and
rushed to the hospital.

LET'S CHANGE OUR OPINION! NOW!

We so often read and hear about the calloused,
hardened criminal. Can that prejudiced point of
view be reconciled with the clamor these inmates
are making in their efforts to help others.

No remuneration other than personal satisfac-
tion was given these-prisoners for these donations
to humanity. Let us hope that when our books are
finally closed by the Greatest Accountant of all that
Justice will be better meted out than it has been by
the many little bookkeepers here below.

DOLLARS FOR SKCURER SECURITY

It causes one’s faith in human nature to waver,
and the inmate’s concept of “modern penology” to
fly out the window whenever one passes a new build-
ing now under construction here at ESP.

The Hastern State Penitentiary is classified as a
maximum security prison. However, there is now
under construction a new security building within
these walls, a maximum, maximum-security block.

As one enters, he is struck by the tightness of
the place and the over-abundanee of solid steel bars

and steel plate. All doors are electrically controlled
and operated from a master panel. There is a corri-
dor running the length of the building and bisecting
it, is a floor-to-ceiling partition of bars, so that even
when the inmate is out of his cell, he is still separated
from the patrolling guard by this steel bar barrier.
Hach cell is 8 feet long and 6 feet wide. Anchored
to the wall is an iron slatted bed (¢mmovable). The
occupant of this cage has approximately 6 feet of
walking space—two paces forward and 2 paces aft—
There is no hght within the cell proper, in the ceiling,
outside the cell, will be a small watt electric bulb,
this light will remain on 24 hours a day. Arrange-
ment of the cell bars will make reading very difficult,
as there is only a three-inch space between bars.
Food will be served through a slot in the bottom of
the door, this slot can only be operated from the out-
side.

NEW CONCEPTS IN PRISON REFORM

IN CONNECTICUT: Plans to construct a new cam-
pus style prison at Enfield, Conn. have passed the
state’s legislative body. The new institution is ex-
pected to be completed by early 1960.

Facilities at the prison will include all the latest
developments in modern prison administration.

There will be no cells or bars and all guards
will have the title of “custodian.”

Policy at the new prison will stress education
and rehabilitation.

IN MEXICO: How backward is Mexico? A new
prison in Mexico is now under construction, a prison
without bars or locks, called by its architect “A
Factory of New Men.” Inmates will live in dormi-
tories, and learn trades in modern work shops.

Mexican penologists have proven “prisoners
don’t have to be penned up in eells.”

THE PRISONERS’ BOOK

Most maximum security prisons are built around
a frame of severe rules. The “book” tells the pris-
oner when he is to wash his face or comb his hair.
They very nearly tell him when he can breathe.
Most of these prisons operate on the premise that if
a prisoner’s will and spirit can be broken, he will
obey prison regulations to a “T”. True, he will obey
prison regulations and may even become a model
prisoner. But when he is released, the tree that has
been bending with the wind will snap upright and
smack Mister Public right square in the face.

Maximum security institutions build only two
things in the prisoner; a terrible hatred of author-
ity—any kind of authority—and a penchant for con-
Spiracy and secrecy. As long as such prisons are
built in this country, there will be bitter and defiant
men released from them. Pennsylvania needs a new
prison, but an entirely new one. Not a rebuilt hulk
of a failure.— THE END
