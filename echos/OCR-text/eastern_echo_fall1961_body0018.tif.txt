How far Have Ke Gone ?

Have we really established a vocational program that
will produce capable and confident craftmen or are

our prison shops just time-killers, and, waste of money?

by Thomas Williams

The vocational systems now in use throughout most
of the United States prisons are a conglomeration of
differences in methods of use of prison labor. The
differences lie in the systems employed in accordance
with the location, size and type of prison. In order to
equip the man with the necessary job training pre-
paratory to release, many things have to be taken
into consideration. The screening process must be
employed. The questions that should be a part of
every vocational director’s job language are: What
type of work the individual desires? (Can we supply
his needs?) What are his educational qualifications?
(Can we teach him?) What type of job is suitable—
in regards to length of sentence? Are the salaries
adequate to the labor and to the minimum needs of
the prisoner? These questions were once thought of
as useless because of the punishment factor being the
dominating theme in most prisons. We cannot sepa-
rate prison labor from the rehabilitation programs
now in operation. It surely cannot be minimized. tht
a parolee is in society without the necessary training
to fit certain types of work, he will inevitably be dis-
missed from his job. Without adequate finances to
sustain his daily needs, he is surely a prey for any
type of illegal persuasions. If society must feel the
hostility of these individuals because of inadequate
training prior to release, then why minimize the ad-
ministration of job training as a prerequisite to re-
lease? It is definitely part and parcel of the total
rehabilitative program now in operation within the
nations prisons.

The inmates work program was once thought of as
part of his corporeal punishment. The idea was to
subject the prisoner to as much hard and useless la-
bor as was physically possible. This was demon-
strated most accurately when chain gangs flourished
throughout the United States prison system. In

many prisons the men were shackled and forced to
labor many hours at rock breaking. The only skill re-
quired was the prisoner’s own strength and endur-
ance to stand up—under such brutal work. The other
terrible extreme was idleness. The nonsensical idea
of this procedure was to keep the prisoner locked up
for an interminable length of time daily. His only re-
spite from the monotony of doing nothing was the
couple of hours in the small exercise yards. Its main
objective was ‘‘solitude with labor and reformation
through reflection and expiation.’’ This latter system
was known as the separate and solitary confinement
system. This type of system was most evident in the
smaller penitentiaries of this country. One of the
advocates of this system during the years of 1831 to
1915 was the old Eastern State Penitentiary at Phila-
delphia. Many of the prisoners to while away the
lonely hours did individual craft work in their cells.
This consisted of small shelves, seale models and
other assorted craft work. Most of these were sold
to the warders of the prisons or sent home. In 1913
the Pennsylvania plan of separate and solitary con-
finement was abandoned officially. This was as a
direct result of Legislation recommended by Gover-
nor Tener. The practice persisted, however, minutely
many years after the seemingly abolition of this
former policy. The idea that labor in prison should
be a productive, rehabilitative, and skilled endeavor
was not a new idea. Even among the terrible condi-
tions of yesteryear, there were men like Dr. Benjamin
Rush who preachd theories far beyond his time. A
prison booklet edited by Dr. Negley Teeters entitled,
‘“A Plan for the Punishment of Crime’’ states many
of the great theorics and plans of this man. His de-
nunciation in 1786 of the whipping post, pillories,
stocks and labor gave rise to postulates that were
advocated by many penologists. He stated that,
‘*The inmates of his house of repentance should be
self-supporting. The labor should be regulated and
