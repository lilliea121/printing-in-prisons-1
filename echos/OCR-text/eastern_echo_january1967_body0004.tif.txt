of men, women and children. Hastern inmates form a
community of men. Only-lonely-men. Heaped upon
this agony is the seemingly contrived, but nonetheless
present, lack of substantial means for the inmate to
gain or maintain a modicum of self reliance (To each
convict there are many more and varied agonies).
Such an environmental situation does not indicate a
rehabilitative process or spell S-E-C-U-R-I-T-Y.

Like every non-convict community, the convict com-
munity has need for a financial equilibrium. Convicts
earning 15¢, 20¢, 25¢ and 50¢ for daily wages, then
paying 27¢ for one tube of toothpaste, can find no bal-
ance here. It is true that an Kastern inmate can go
along day after day not spending one thin dime—and
still live. It is similarly true for the non-convict. Fre-
quently such people are called bums. Frequently these
people feel like bums.

Whatever reasons for the non-convicts bum be-
havior, the convict may have ample reason for behav-
ing as he often does. Perhaps he is saving for the free-
dom effort. Even the most frugal effort is costly to
the 15¢ a day wage earner. Perhaps he has found him-
self to be even more guilty than charged. This man
will not appeal to wife, parents, children or friends
for sustenance—the very people he has hurt the most.
Conversely, perhaps the underpaid inmate does ask
others for money. This action does not endear him to
himself. And in many instances this request in being
‘“answered’’ creates further hardship upon those who
should be receiving money from the inmate.

It is unlikely that anyone will view an abnormal
way of life as truly rehabilitative, but there are some
measures which could be undertaken to bring rehabili-
tation more in focus with reality. One of these is an
increased wage scale for convicts. An increase of sub-
stantial proportions simply handed out as a dole from
the state would not in itself supply the full answer to
the problem. But by earning wages commensurate to
the cost of prison living all inmates would have a
minimal opportunity for self-reliance.

After ten years in the womb, the Eastern Echo
has at last been born! This is the ‘‘feeling’”’
of the present editor and his staff. Consequent-
ly Vol. 1, No. 1, indicates “here we are’’ as
opposed to ten years of pre-natal Echo “‘pres-

Drawins A Line

We all know that maps are not the territory
which they represent. A map of infinite detail would
leave us hanging from a high level of abstract reason-
ing should we foolishly apply its symbols as being
knowledge of a certain nation and her citizens. It
may be interesting map knowledge that Italy is a
peninsula, geographically the shape of a crude boot.
It is important human knowledge that a vast majority
of Italians are Catholics (No matter, really, if Italy
has the shape of a Lollobrigida leg). Because Italy
is accurately represented on a map to have a lengthy
Sea coast, could we possibly know that this nation has
many or few ships? In this context, then, it can be
seen and understood that there are lines—lines of in-
terest and lines of specific importance—which repre-
sent our natural earth. But about the ways of man
who live upon this earth, there is no ‘‘map’’ for us
to follow.

Man, it seems to me, has a penchant for drawing
lines. The line which I wish to eall your attention to
today, is the one man draws between himself and his
fellow man. Like the lines on our maps, they repre-
sent a ‘‘territory,’’? but they are not the real article.

The person who says, ‘“‘I hate niggers!’’ has
drawn a line between himself and every black-skinned
human being on this earth. The guy saying, ‘‘All
faggots should be shot!’’ draws his particular line.
An Afro-American stating, ‘‘ Whitey is a more clever
version of the Nazi!’’ firmly draws his line. There
we have three misshapen ‘‘maps.’’ The reason I say
these are representative lines but never the territory
described, is because the identifying level of abstrac-
tion is so high and precarious that it crumbles in
every instance when confronted with reason.

‘‘ All criminals are animals and should be kept
in prison!’’

‘‘The only reason all people haven’t done what
I did is because they are afraid to!”’

All criminals are animals and should be kept in
prison? The only reason all people haven’t done what
I did is because they are afraid to? There it is—by
turning line drawing—map making exclamatory
statements Into questions, we have something every-
one of us can get next to; lines which reason can
formulate into understanding.

It is a fact that I am.a convict. It is a fact
that Mr. Brierley is a warden, What sort of a ‘‘map”’
can you draw from having only these two facts?
(Which of us is Shaped like a boot? Which lke a
heel?) Unfortunately, for those of us who are con-
victs, many people not im prison draw lines forming
maps of conclusion based upon the single fact—is
