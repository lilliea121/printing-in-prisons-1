The employer was still hesitant. “Frankly,” he
said, “an associate of mine once hired an ex-convict
and it was a costly experience.”

Hannum said, “Did your friend screen the man and
hire him on good grounds or was he just trying to do
somebody a favor?”

“No, he didn’t screen him,” the employer admitted.

“But why give preference to an ex-prisoner when
there are non-criminal applicants who could use the
* )
job?

“It depends on how well you want this job done,”
Hannum replied. “And remember that this man has
a great deal to lose if he doesn’t succeed.”

The employer capitulated.

When grateful convicts ask Hannum how they can
repay him, he answers: “Just keep your eyes open
and let me know whenever there’s a job opening in
your company.”

Osborne’s executive director, Austin H. MacCorm-
ick, a noted penologist, explains Hannum’s job-cast-
ing success this way: “Bob is a human IBM machine.
One part of his brain is an inventory of countless
trades and skills for which ex-prisoners can qualify.
Another part is an exhaustive file of employers. Press
an invisible button and Bob can pair prisoner and
position with electronic speed.”

The Osborne Association operates its vocational
program on a sparse annual budget of $25,000, con-
tributed by the agency’s 400 sponsors. Contributions
also come from police chiefs, prison wardens and
from former convicts who are now successful busin-
essmen.

To save a chent from skid row until he can get a
job, Hannum stakes him. with money for living costs
or establishes credit for him with some friendly res-
taurant and lodginghouse. The Osborne staff told me
proudly that out of $6982 lent to 985 needy men dur-
ing 1955, $2378 has already been repaid.

Less than one tenth of one per cent of all Osborne-
recommended men have ever stolen from the employ-
ers. On the other hand, an unserupulous employer
once phoned Osborne and requested an ex-prisoner
with bookkeeping experience. This employer had
been muleting his partners and planned to frame the
ex-convict for the company’s financial shortage.
When the man was arrested, Hannum had the facts
ventilated and established his innocence.

One of Hannum’s favorite stories concerns “Trig-
ger” L—, who had served time for armed rob-
bery. Trigger had to sweat it out for four months
before Hannum finally found a boss willing to gamble
on his going straight. For five years Trigger toiled
honestly, and saved enough money to open a hard-
ware store in the Midwest. Business was so good that
he soon needed an assistant. Mindful of the break
society had given him, Trigger stipulated in the ad:
Only ex-convicts need apply.

The successful applicant was a youth who admitted
having served two years for automobile theft. Three
months later, when Trigger told his assistant that he
was giving him a $10 raise, the boy made a tearful
confession.

“Yowve been swell to me, but there’s something
you should know. T’ve never been to jail. I lied be-
cause I needed the work.”

P's. He kept the job. - ©@

“What Can I Do?”’

In his spare time, a police officer in Reading, Pa., Detective Charles S.
Wade, runs a home improvement company which grosses nearly a million dol-
lars a year. What makes his company different is that most of his 45 em-
ployees are ex-convicts — many arrested by Wade.

Some of his employees formerly brandished guns at him. One, a | 6-year old
parole violator who had already fired four times at the police, pointed a shot-
gun at Wade and told him to stay back or get his head blown off. Wade put
down his own service revolver. “Son, you'r not in real trouble yet. Give me a
couple of minutes to talk to you... before you do something that will send

you to the chair.”

The youngster gave him three and a half hours to talk — but without
lowering his gun. Wade explained “You're going to jail, but when you get out,
{ promise you a job so you can live like a human being.”’ Finally the boy drop-
ped the gun, “You're the first person in the world that didn’t sound like he was

lying to me.”

Though most of the employees in Wade's firm are ex-convicts, only he
knows which ones these are. He starts all workers at a minimum of $60 for a
40-hour week, encourages them to develop skills that enable them to earn $80

to $90 per week.

Wade and his wife have recently purchased a | 0-acre estate near Reading,
which they plan to use as a recreation center for his employees and fellow
policemen and their families. It includes swimming pools, baseball field, lodge

hall and lake for boating.

“If I can educate the public to accept the man who made a mistake,’ Wade
said, “I can educate the man himself to accept the public.”
