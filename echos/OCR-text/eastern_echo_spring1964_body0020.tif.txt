SI AND

The Right to Know

by Thomas J. Williams

In the last decade there have been many significant
changes throughout America. Many important issues
on the horizon have confronted the United States de-
manding answers. Eighty-five percent of the issues,
the Cuban situation and many others, have been shuf-
fled and reshuffled until they resemble a mass of
jumbled words. Sometimes during this garbled strife
an issue is pushed farther away from our conscious
awareness—reappearing periodically when a particu-
lar person or group see fit to test its lawful validity.
This is often tried through the courts or by seeking
redress of grievances through important personages
within the community, state, or federal government.
Another instance is when an enterprising newspaper
or individual deems it necessary to air its views or his
views in an objective manner. Such has been the case
with the issue, CENSORSHIP, as it is popularly
known.

The word ‘““CENSORSHIP”’ derives from ““CEN-
OR,” meaning an official appointed to examine
books, manuscripts, plays, etc., prior to publication
or performance, to ascertain if there is anything im-
moral or offensive in them; one who censures or
blames; a critic. This definition is accepted world-
wide as definitively correct. However, its social and
lawful plausibility is questionable. It has become, in
the last decade, such an explosive subject that it has
been placed at the forefront with such other hotly
contested subjects as religion, unemployment, etc.
We can no longer ignore its existence nor its influence
over our private lives. It has caused much consterna-
tion and perplexity to our citizens, as evidenced by
the many examples of its philosophy in action.

Censorship, with its multi-ingenious ways of skirt-
ing truth, has been wallowing in its two main themes

popular at the moment. We know them as obscenity
and immorality. In regards to the former (obscenity)
it has been defined as: Impurity in language or action;
indecent; filthy. The definition just stated is short,
terse, and specific in its meaning. Yet, this very def-
inition, as complete as it seems, is the very one which
has today sent members of the Supreme Court in
consultation for months deciding on its lawful juris-
diction over individual choice. What makes it so
dificult to set in order, is the fact that every indi-
vidual has his own definite ideas of impurities in
thought and action. And those ideas are spread over
the entire country amalgamated into a mass of gen-
eral by-laws, which, in effect, could mean anything,
pertain to anything without spelling out specifically,
what, why, and how.

Some of these laws date back many generations,
when, during those puritan-minded times, it was im-
proper for a lady to speak to a gentleman on the
street, first. The Bible was the proper book to read
in the majority of the homes.

As our civilization modernized itself and sought to
rid itself partially of these chains of morality, it be-
came a tug of war between the new mind and the old.
What has made the situation so farcical is that man
finds it hard to eradicate the old, because of the anti-
quated mind still lingering within our masses, in
young bodies. And, this has brought about a conflict
of ideas on what is right and proper. Each individual
leaning on the teaching of his childhood, as the prime
factor influencing his ideas of today. This has befud-
dled the situation even more. Understandably, the
millions of parents sometimes did not, or do not,
have the proper education, freedom of mind, or social
