in the league. At shortstop he’s get-
ting the job done in fine style—and
keeps the Braves’ defense very tight
with glove and speed afoot in moving
to his left and right for those hard
smashes SHOT IN HIS DIRECTION.
Dick is really measuring up as a future
star. Hayman has been doing a lot of
the catching in order to help along his
young pitchers. Ernest Robinson, their
owner, has also been in several games
and don’t let anyone tell you he is get-
ting old. This ““Old Man”’ as they refer
to him almost killed the Falcons single
handed last season in the Championship
games. This is another year so, “Good
luck boys,’ and keep fighting hard.

The Dodgers, like the Braves, got off
to a very poor start. When the new
owners acquired this club all the play-
ers had been picked, but “‘Big John” re-
cruited what he could and is trying to
do the best he can. This club has the
material on paper to give any club in
the league a tough game. If the mem-
bers of this team would get together
and really put their minds down and
play ball the way they know how to
play they could be the spoilers in the
league. They have a good pitcher in
T. J. and Muggs is no easy touch either.
They have the best and for sure the
oldest infield in the institution in Joe
Buzzard-1B, Rock-SS and Rob Watson-
3B. Scoleri at 2B is far the youngest.
This boy has really learned to play his
position well and he can play the balls
hit off that wall just as if he has been
playing that position for many years.
As for the catching department we
again may not have the youngest but
we have the best in Alexander, Arkan-
sas and Rice. The outfield is not the
worst either, because there have been
some good plays made by Herb Allen,
Rudy, Turk, “Big John’? and Tampa.
Rudy and Charlie Whiting are excellent
reserves along with Slempa. We all
know that this team can play better ball
than the record indicates. It has been
oroven with victories over the Mustangs,
Falcons and Braves. There have been
games that this team had the lead until
the sixth and seventh innings only to go

Eastern Echo

down in defeat at the last moment be-
cause of errors. This team has only
been shut-out once and that was a no-
hitter thrown at them by “‘No No” of
the Falcons. They have the tools and

are going to go places once they get
started. This will be real soon—wait
and see. Come on fellows lets play
from the heart—you can do it.

The Most Valuable Player Awards - 1963

During the past winter many awards were presented to the various athletes

for excelling in their particular field as being the best.

HANDBALL

Of late there has been great enthusi-
asm shot into the game of handball with
the appearance of one, Paul Barringer,
who proposes his games as being the
best —-barring none. This has created
quite a stir among some of the better
players, such as Ed Parks, Frank
“Smitty” Smith, John Walker, Leonard
Massey, ‘Moose’ Holloman, Sam
Brown and Charlie Whiteside. They
are all ready, willing and able to take
on this “Demon” Barringer anytime.
Sam ‘“‘Blase’’ Jordan has stated he fears
none of the above on the court and is
ready to prove it to them. As a team
Ed Parks & “‘Smitty”’ state: They fear
no competition whatsoever from any-
one in the institution. We'll play any
and all competitors that may doubt us
as being the greatest since the Atomic
Bomb. This is what we two really are
—Bombs. Come one, come all, feel
the wraths of Parks & Smitty. It is a
known fact that before the long hot
summer is over many of these same
voices will be silenced when tourna-
ment time arrives.

Gongratulations

Our since departed Athletic Director
J. S. Thompson was presented with a
Sportsman's Award by Gus Force on
behalf of the participating personnel
as the outstanding benefactor towards
the elevation of the sports program at
this institution. We want to wish Mr.
Thempson lots of luck in his new
position.

At this time I would like to person-
ally congratulate the above recipients
and wish them continued success in the
future—inside and outside the walls.
May the year 1963 produce an even
greater amount of fresh new talent.
The above athletes proved their worth
as recipients of the trophies; this I’m
quite sure will boost the morale of the
sporting program here for a long time
to come. E.S.P. has always produced
an array of great talented athletes past
and present. Let’s keep up the good
work.
