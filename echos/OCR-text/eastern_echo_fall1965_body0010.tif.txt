PRE-TRIAL

PUBLICITY _

A VIEW FROM

In all the discussions regarding pre-trial publici-
ty, many voices are being heard. Both sides, news
media and legal groups, have expressed their view-
points. But what of the “‘middleman’s”’ viewpoints?

No one seems too concerned about the viewpoint
of the person who will be, or has been, subjected to
pre-trial publicity—the prisoner.

This is not surprising because the prisoner—or
criminal, or defendant, or whatever—is resigned to be-
ing ignored as he is put through the “grist mill’’ of
legal procedure.

There is much to be said in favor of both sides of
the argument. This presents a paradox because, at
the same time, there is much to be said against both

sides. In the past neither side has been without sin.

NO ONE CARES

There have been instances where newspaper cov-
erage undoubtedly helped form conclusions before
cases came to trial. But if those cases could be
tallied, they would probably be found to be very much
in the minority among the thousands that go through
the legal “‘grist mill’’ each year.

The publicity given the majority of cases has
little, if any, effect because it is forgotten by the
time the case comes to trial. It is forgotten because
no one cares.

Oh, they care enough to read the “lurid details’”’ of
the moment. ‘They care enough to want to see so-
ciety protected. But they don‘t really care unless the
case affects them personally. How many persons
keep abreast of every case, all the way from arrest
to conviction? Very few.

Even in prison, where the “‘lurid details’? are de-
voured daily, very few remember the details by the

time the convicted man joins them among the “‘num-

bered.”’

Where do newspapers get the “‘lurid details’’ to re-
late to their readers? From the very officials who
now want to shut the door in their faces. For years
they have been supplying the “‘facts’’ that make up

the news stories.

LIBELOUS PROCEDURE

BEHIND The BARS

many times, detrimental and erroneous—sometimes
knowingly false—statements are issued to the press.
Officials have come to feel secure in this libelous
action because the party involved usually has neither
the means nor the power for recourse.

The press too often accepts these official state-
ments at face value, safe in the knowledge that they
have an attributable source in the event the statement
is challenged.

A few years ago,a jury found a man not guilty ata
Detroit murder trial. A woman testified, no doubt at
great personal embarrassment, that she and the man
had been together in a hotel room at the time of the
murder. Her statement was substantiated, making it
impossible for the man to have committed the murder.

If he were not guilty, the conclusion that someone
else is should be elementary, and the case still open.

When newsmen conferred with the head of the
homicide division,,1sking what the police were going
to do, he answered,,‘‘As far as we’re concerned, the
case is closed. He's the guy.”

A police official has a public responsibility. Part
of that responsibility is not to make public state-

quitted the man. In this instance the statement was
made after the trial, but in many, many instances
comparatively damaging statements:are made before
trials, and just as readily reported.

ABUSES IN SILENCE

These are some of the sinsof the press. What about
the official faction that claims they can correct these
sins by withholding information and forbidding pre-
trial statements? Granting that they would achieve
their goal, granting for argument’s sake only, wouldn‘t
they be opening the door to other more disastrous
abuses?

As conscientious and sincere as the American Bar
Association may be in its aims, how do we protect
arrested persons from abuses that could come out of

the “‘silent treatment?”’
Somewhere along the line, some over-zealous police

official is going to take advantage of the opportunity
