The Relation
of
Man and Work

Rev. Paul Washington
Episcopal Chaplain

Today I see man’s relationship to work from three
different angles:

1. Those who need work, any kind of work, in
order that they can survive. (I know some fellows
whom you may know, and they would consider them-
selves rich to earn thirty dollars a week.)

2. Those who are securely employed who demand
more and more at the end of each contract, regardless
of whether they earn one hundred dollars a week or
forty-thousand dollars a year.

3. Those who consider work to be as necessary
toward a helpful life as eating or loving and being
loved, and they pray that from their work’s they will
again be able to sufficiently meet the financial de-
mands which they must face.

Jesus told what we know of today as “the Parable
of the Laborers in the Vineyard.” A man met some
men in the market place at six a.m. and entered into
a contract with them to work in his vineyard for a
penny (17 cents) a day. They agreed and went to
work.

He met a second group at nine a.m. and made no
fixed contract but promised them fair compensation.

He ealled others to work at noon, and finally the
last group one hour before quitting time.

At six p.m. all of the men were called to receive
their pay; the first group received the seventeen cents
which they were promised, but he gave all of the
others the same amount, even those who only worked
one hour. Some were fit to be tied, and I guess you
know who.

The Master was trying to say that all who wanted
to work should have this opportunity; and all should
receive enough to live on.

All men are expected to work for a living, but be-
cause of individual differences and the particular and
peculiar circumstances of each, the quality as well
as the quantity of work done by each will be dif-
ferent; but for everyone who offers the best of him-
self, he should reeeive enough to meet the basic needs
of his life.

To those who employ, He says: look upon the work-
man as a human being, not as a “thing,” to be used,

Eastern Echo

to be evaluated as an economic commodity. Look
upon him as a human being who wants to live, and
help him to live.

A man cannot be paid what he is worth. He and his
work are one. His work is his life. But every man
has his needs. Therefore, let the man who works,
work for the common good; and those who employ
do so for the same reason, herein lies the brother-
hood of man to man.

‘' Man is Born to
Labor and the Birds
to Fly. ’ (Job V-7)

Father John J. McHugh
Catholic Chaplain

Prior to the fall of Adam and Eve, work was only
a relaxation for man. But after the fall, God said to
Adam, “In the sweat of thy face, thou shalt eat bread,
until thou return to the earth out of which thou wert
taken.” (Genesis 111-19)

As the law of work was laid upon Adam in Para-
dise by God as an expiation of his faults, all who
work do the will of God, and performs an act that is
pleasing to Him. Work has a bitter root, but the fruit
it bears is sweet. The idler finds his time long and is
a burden to himself, whereas the industrious is con-
tented and cheerful.

It has frequently been stated that idleness is the
curse of most prisons. Because it helps them to do
“time” better, most prisoners want to work. Unfor-
tunately, labor unions, manufacturers. and security
regulations restrict the opportunity for a prison ad-
ministration to provide “on the job” type of training
that would be beneficial to an inmate. But despite the
limited facilities and the fact that there is not enough
constructive work for everyone, many inmates are
being taught proper work habits. They have come to
a realization that if they are to take their place in a
competitive society they must be better equipped.
This is especially true in the educational field as
evidenced by the number of those who attend the
school. Also in creative activity, as in the craft shops,
the art and journalism classes, many have displayed
talents of which they were unaware.

Prisoners are people and in keeping with their dig-
nity, should have ample opportunity to improve
themselves. Those in charge have an obligation to

encourage education and the positive value of work

as a therapeutic tool. Much has been done in this di-
rection but the situation is far from ideal. It is up to
the public to aecept penal institutions not only as
places of punishment and confinement, but as instru-
ments for improvement and rehabilitation.
