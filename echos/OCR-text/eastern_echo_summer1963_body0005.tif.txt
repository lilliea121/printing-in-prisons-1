STRIP MINING:

When a vein of ore occurs close to
the surface of the ground, the mining
method employed is called “Strip min-
ing” and/or “Open pit mining.” This
method consists of taking the material
from the surface with huge steam or
electric shovels. This is one of the
methods of obtaining coal in Pennsyl-
vania.

Bulldozer, power shovel, air compressor and a pneumatic drill is
the basic equipment for strip mining; also it is all that is needed to
start poison creeks, rivers, and wells from the toxic sulphuric acid that
is present in the uncovered coal seams. In no time, a once yirent
land can become a desolate waste.

Reflect upon the brutal and myopic work of strip-mining. They
search and tear, uproot and dig a rural tract of land, causing ugly
lacerations of the soil, leaving in their departure stones and rocks
and unproductive barrenness and deep wells of toxic water, in their
never ending search for coal. i
