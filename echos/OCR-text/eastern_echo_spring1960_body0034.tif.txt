Many inmates write to the American Civil Liberties Union for help. While A. C. L. U. is always open to re-
quests for assistance, we are very seldom able to help prisoners. Inmates considering asking for A. C. L. U.
help should know the following:

1. The Philadelphia office of the ACLU has no lawyer on its staff.

2. ACLU is never able to send a representative to interview an inmate.

3. ACLU does not offer assistance to persons convicted in Philadelphia County because the Defender
Association of Philadelphia is available to consider requests of this sort.

4. In general, where an inmate was represented by counsel at his trial, or sentencing, ACLU must
assume that the inmate received due process. We do not have the manpower to review every court
proceeding which turned out bad for the defendant.

5. ACLU is willing to investigate cases in which the inmate says he has not been represented by
counsel, or is unable to obtain counsel.

6.

Inmates writing to ACLU should state whether or not they were represented by counsel in the
matter complained of, and if so, his name and address.

7. ACLU does not concern itself with parole plans.

ACLU would like to do more for prisoners, but it is a small organization. We hope that this explanation
will help inmates realize our limitations, and will save inmates from disappointment.

CHECK MATE cont.

February 1st found Post 388 supplying the com-
petition for our Reserves in a match that saw A.
Swelly, Fr. Darrah, and C. Norman lose to Trucis,
Segal, and Spiegel, while Rade defeated Berry and
Harman drew with Kantner, for a 3$ to 14 point win
TOI mOStma oo:

In addition to the foregoing Association play our
teams were active in competition with the Temple
University Chess Team on December 12th, in a match
that gave Temple its first win in several tries at ESP
when Rubin and Heims won over Williams and
Hewitt. Swelly beat Darlington and Hallowell drew
with Hendrickson.

On January 16th, the Philadelphia Department
of Streets and Water Chess Team visited the institu-
tion to oppose our Club. The match found Swelly
drawing with Nyanette, Harman defeat Gerson (a
former olympic wrestler) in 11 moves, and Jordan

32

losing to Minkil.

On January 30th, ten members of the Marple-
Newton Chessmen came to the institution for a get-
acquainted match. This club is one of the newest
members of the Phila. Chess Association and is antici-
pating opening play in competition when next Sept-
ember arrives and another season of League play
starts. This Club promises to put new life and fire in
the Chess Association.

This group of energetic men did not fair too well
against our club as M. Pearson, T. Brawner, W.
Hallowell, A. Paschedag, F. Darrah, and N. Harman
won for our club over E. Kelly, T. Kelly, T. Reinners-
man, W. Morrison, G. Kirkpatrick, and C. Pierdim-
inico, during which time P. Murter and R. Cole de-
feated A. Swelly and A. Rade for two M-N wins. In
the other two matches of the day, R. Kreutz drew
with T. Williams and A. Suarez drew with R. Walton.
