seeking is the jury’s sense of justice. If we were
seeking a rule that accorded logically with legal
principles, we would not use the right and wrong
test. Instead we should have to use a test of capacity
to entertain criminal intent, or of amenability to pun-
ishment. But all we really want, and at all events all
we are ever going to get, is the jury’s judgment as to
whether, in the light of the defendant’s condition, he
ought to be held responsible and punishable.

And the best device for getting an enlightened
jury judgment is the Durham Case Rule. Under that
Rule, as the court in the Durham ease itself said, the
jury will be expected to apply the requirement ot
causal connection in such a way as to carry out its
traditional function of expressing the community
judgment on the justice of the case. ‘‘Juries,’’ said
the court, ‘‘will continue to make moral judgments,
still operating under the fundamental precept that
‘Our collective conscience does not allow punishment
where it cannot impose blame.’ ”’

And in making its judgment, the jury under the
Durham Rule will have the benefit of a fuller and
truer explanation of the facts of mental life. It would
permit the doetor to describe in his own language the
examination he made of the defendant and the diag-
nosis he arrived at, and the symp-
toms and other data upon which
that diagnosis was based. If, in his
opinion, the defendant is mentally

one’s conduct to the requirement of law—instead of
emphasizing the unitary nature of human personality.

And while the Royal Commission formula would be
franker, the Durham requirement of a causal connec-
tion between the disorder and the crime has merit.
There may be cases where the defendant was fairly
certainly suffering from a mental disorder, but where
that disorder had nothing to do with the crime. A
person may suffer from epilepsy, and yet commit a
crime when he was not in an epileptic state and when
his disorder did not affect his criminal conduct. It is
true that in other cases the closeness of the connec-
tion between the disorder and the crime may be much
more difficult to determine and will have to depend
upon facts of the given case; the question will not
usually be determinable on the basis of any general
medical principle. But where a person suffering from
a recognized form of mental disorder commits a
crime, there is always some likelihood of a causal
connection between the disorder and the crime; and
generally, the more serious the disorder and the more
serious the crime, the more probable it is that a causal
connection exists. At least in eases where the crime
is serious and largely unmotivated, the presumption
should be that the act was the product of the dis-
order, and the burden should be on the prosecution

to show that in the instant case the
defendant, though disordered, was
nevertheless responsible.

in his opinion the act charged was ———~
the product of that disorder. It is
one of the strengths, and not a
weakness, of the Durham Rule
that it would rely more on a dy-
namie and changing medical con-
cept of mental disorder than on a
engl amicl Sige west.”

It has been objeted that if what
we weallhy wee ms woe quer
“moral judgment,’’ we should put
that responsibility to them clearly,
and frankly, instead of obscuring
it by inviting the jury to explore
the meta-physical problem of caus-
ation. A majority of the Royal
Commission on Capital Punishment favored doing
just that—asking the jury whether the accused was
suffering from mental disease or defect “‘to such
a degree that he ought not be held responsible.’’
Professor Wechsler would have liked to see the Model
Penal Code adopt a rule that a person should not be
held criminally responsible if he was so mentally dis-
ordered that his capacity to appreciate the crimin-
ality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the
requirements of law ‘‘is so substantially impaired
that he cannot justly be held responsible.’’ The latter
proposal seems less desirable than the Royal Commis-
sion wording, because it does not really leave the
issue of responsibility to the jJury’s sense of justice.
It still focuses attention on two artifically abstracted
symptoms of mental disorder—capacity to appreciate
the criminality of the act or capacity to conform

Eastern Echo

though they deal with a subject

a where the law must rest on psy-
chiatric premises, the psychiatrists

tell us that laws’ premise are un-
sound. Specifically, they deny the
premise that mind is divisible into

processes are interdependent and
interrelated, and mental disorder
effects them all. Psychiatry denies
that either appreciation of crimin-
ality or capacity to conform can be
treated as independent functions.
If we are going to revise the legal rule, we should
seck to adopt one that will bridge the gap that now
exists between legal and psychiatric thinking. We
are going to have to rely on members of the psyehia-
tric profession to give us enlightenment and insight
into the mental condition of criminal defendants. We
cannot ask them to perform this function for us un-
less we make it possible for them to present a con-
scientious and scientifically meaningful diagnosis.
The only rule that meets this criterion is that set
forth in the Durham Case. ®
