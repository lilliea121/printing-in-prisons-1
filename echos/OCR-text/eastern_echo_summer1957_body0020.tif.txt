.. . ONE ERROR

remaining five grand around on the Yankees. At
nine to five, he figures to be able to buy Gloria’s
ring, and have quite a bit of change left over. So
now that the fix is in and the bets are down, Pete
goes home to gloat, and wait for the game to be
over so that he can count his ill-gotten gains.

The rest of this tender little tale was recorded
on almost every sports page in the country.

The Indians get one run in their half of the
third inning, and they can’t push a man past second
for the rest of the night. But it turns out that one
run is enough to wrap up the old ball game, because
Rube muffles the Yanks’ big guns by pitching a
no-hit, no-run game.

The next day the papers are full of the story
of the ‘‘nice fellah’’ that came to see Rube before
the game and gave him five hundred dollars to
throw it. In Rube’s own words, it goes something
like this:

“‘T’ll never forgit that nice man. He gave me all
that money jest t’ throw that there ball game. Well,
I throwed jes’ as hard as I could. I told him I’d
make it extry good. Gee, he was a fine gennulman.
I hope he ain’t mad cause I walked that one guy.”’

Nobody sees Pete for quite awhile after this,
but now he is back on the main stem and you can
see him every day in ‘‘Marty’s Cafe’’. This was
always his favorite spot. Only now, instead of being
waited on, Sure Pop is washing the dishes. He’s not
doing too bad for a guy that always thought that
*‘work’’ was a dirty word.

Gloria?... When Pete tells her he’s broke, she
drops him like he has leprosy. But that same night
the Indians bring Rube into the ‘‘Chartreuse
Chateaux’’ to celebrate his no-hitter. When little
Glory spies this human money making machine,
she turns on the heat full blast... And the next
time the Indians come to town, Gloria and Rube
get set in double harness.

You can still see Gloria around in the small

hours of the morning. She gets up at four a. m. to
milk the cows. Right after they are married, Rube’s
priceless flipper goes bad, so he has to quit baseball
and go back to the farm.

Yep... life is full of profitable little surprises.
