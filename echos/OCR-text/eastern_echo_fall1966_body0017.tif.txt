Each editor pervaded the magazine with his own
special personality. To speak in terms of this natural
trait as contributing to the success of the magazine
would be a prevarication. The majority of Echo
Editors assumed their literary position untrained,
and painfully groped their way through many dif-
ficult situations. It has been said that ‘‘The writer
as well as the orator employs for the accomplishment
of his purposes, the instrumentality of words. It is
in words that he clothes his thoughts. It is by means
of words that he depicts his feelings. It is, therefore,
essential to his success that he be provided with a
copious vocabulary and that he possess an entire
command of all the resources and appliances of his
language.”’

These words will be recognized by many of our
readers, for they embody a principal that is neces-
sary but not often possible.

In spite of the temporary drawbacks I have
mentioned, the Hastern Echo can well be proud of
its literary achievements. In 1960 Mrs. Dorothy
Scheer, long a champion of the rehabilitation of men
and women in prison, lauded the Eastern Echo as
one of the finest in the entire national Penal Press.’’
Other words of commendation have come from such
persons as Dr. Negley K. Teeters, Professor of Soci-
ology; Morris Gerber, Esq., (formerly a judge in
Montgomery County); James W. Percy, (former
assistant to Mayor of Laneaster); Erle Stanley

Gardner, Writer, and many others. Echo has received —

similar commendations from various agencies and
boards like the Pennsylvania Prison Society, the Half-
way Houses and others. (My apologies to those indi-
viduals I have not mentioned by name, for they have
been the unsung heroes of our cause.) Without the
encouragement of these people during the Hastern
Echo’s ten year existence, the magazine could not
have been possible.

For a few years the Eastern Echo basked in the
1959-60-61 tributes that had been heaped upon its
literary head. Soon thereafter it went into decline
after being condemned by a few persons who rose to
the prison thrones of officialdom estranged from and
antagonistic to modern concepts of penology. Their
inimical precepts took the form of extreme restric-
tions on material accepted for publication. Thus,
they inhibited writing skills previously displayed and
retarded the latent skills of the would-be writer.

The magazine that once had attracted distin-
guished persons to actually submit articles, commen-
tary or intelligent rebuttals to opinions, degenerated
into a retrogressive format. For it has been proven
that “‘resting on past laurels,’’ however justified, can
only result in stagnation.

Subject material of the Hastern Echo during its
decade of publication has been diverse, with many
shades of literary differences. Some of the subjects
delved in included Parole and Commutation, Juvenile
Delinquency, Psychology and Psychiatry in Prisons,
Worldwide Penal Treatment, Prison Reform, Modern
Penology, Criminal Law, Prison Labor, and others
too numerous to name.

Prominent persons in the community who have
suhmitted articles to the Eastern Echo for publica-
tion are herein listed with the titles of their articles.
Fall 1966

Negley K. Teeters

“‘On Public Executions. ’’

Hon. Judge Raymond Pace Alexander

‘‘A Judge’s View of Commutation in
Pennsylvania. ’’

Michael Von Moschzisker, Esq.
‘*On Stone Casting.”’

Hon. Judge Juamta Kidd Stout
‘‘Shall We Recommend.’’

Hon. Judge Thomas Reed
‘“After Sentence.’

Herman J. Pollock, Esq. (Chief Voluntary,
Defenders Association )

‘‘The Citizens Role in the Improvement of
Criminal Law.’’

Caleb Foote, Professor of Law
‘‘The Bail System and Equal Justice.’’

Paul J. Gernert, Parole Board Chairman
of Pennsylvania

‘Thre Durham Rule; Alcoholism and Crime.”’

On many occasions the persons listed were asked
to present their views on a particular subject. This
was done in order to acquaint the reader with the
other side. The editor responsible for this intelligent
presentation was James ‘‘Mike’’ Smith. He believed
that this kind of objective approach would evoke a
greater interest in the magazine.

He figured that most people had a danted view
on what the man in prison was aiming for, and to
present divergent views would provide the stimulus
for creative thinking as well as writing. The many
letters of praise that poured into the institution
from people of all walks of life lent validity to his
reasoning.

The Eastern Echo’s main premise has been a
magazine written by and for the inmates of the spec-
ific institution publishing same. This premise was
taken from the general creed of the Penal Press. The
“‘Echo’’ has added another sentence, though not writ-
ten. as clearly, was understood by the many staff
writers who have contributed articles throughout the
years. This addition embraces the idea that this maga-
zine is designed to help inmates by speaking through
them and for them, if for any reason they are unable
to do so themselves. In doing this, to present opinions
directly applicable to his incarcerated condition.
