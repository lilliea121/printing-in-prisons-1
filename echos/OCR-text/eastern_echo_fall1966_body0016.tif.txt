History of

lhe
Kastern
Keho

By Tommy Williams

The Penal Press is the official voice of men in
American prisons. Its origin is dubious and specu-
lative at best. Any notoriety has been of a dualistic
nature ranging from verbal acclaim to vociferous
condemnation. Yet, the Penal Press has survived,
mainly because many persons realized the benefits
of a constructive outlet through writing. The writ-
ings have been varied, but the slant has always been
directed at prisons, and people in prison. This is
not to say that this central theme has been the totality
of the inmate’s thought. Prison being the dominating
factor in the expression of thoughts through writing,
ean be justified, considering the closed environment
in which prisoner’s live. The writings of the Penal
Press have run the gamut in format; from the one
page sheets to the forty page slick cover magazines
of many of our larger prisons.

The Eastern Echo is the magazine printed here
at the State Correctional Institutional at Philadelphia.
It had its beginning ten years ago as a fledgling 20
page affair. Its inception can be attributed to the
ideas and official sanction of many. Included was
Mr. Frank G. Martin (Warden at that time - now
deceased) and the official treatment staff. However
the plans, groundwork and first edition can be cred-
ited to one man, Jerry Culp, the magazine’s first
editor. His goals regarding the Kastern Echo could
not be set in motion by himself as he was due to be
released from prison soon after the ‘‘Echo’s’’ first
publication date. Knowing this, he wrote his first
and last editorial as a sort of credo, which successive
editors have vainly sought to follow. I think it is
appropriate that a few paragraphs of this editorial
be quoted to illustrate the central meaning of this
man’s idea.

‘“‘Dear Reader:

‘‘This is the first issue of the Eastern Echo.
This magazine is the newest entry into the penal
press field. It will be the policy of the editors
to present articles, poems, and stories which ex-
press the thoughts and feelings of the men con-
fined at this institution.

‘‘The Eastern Echo is your magazine. It
will be only as good as you want it to be.

‘“‘The Hastern Echo is intended to be the
voice of the men in here. How powerful a voice
depends upon the quality and quantity of the
material submitted.

‘‘Many of us have long looked forward to
a publication for this institution. Since I will
be here for only this issue I would like to advance
my hope that the Hastern Echo will continue to
grow and take its place among the top members
of the Penal Press field. Keep this magazine
as the voice of all the men in here and not of
just one group. Remember that the articles and
stories published by the Hastern Echo will be
read by many citizens of this and other states.
Poor material will reflect on all. Good material
will bring favorable responses and undoubted
benefits. Make the Eastern Echo broad and pro-
gressive in its outlook.

‘‘Quard this tiny new flame of yours against
the glory seeker and the irresponsible. A new
freedom has been handed to you by those in
authority. They will wait to see how you accept
the responsibility.’’

This editorial speaks for itself. It lays down the
broad guidelines of Echo policy which subsequent
editors have felt obligated to follow. The words are
of another decade but time has not erased the value
of them.

Twelve editors have reigned over the magazine
since its auspicious beginning. They are here listed
in chronological order :

Jerry D. Culp: 1956
Joseph Corvi: 1956
