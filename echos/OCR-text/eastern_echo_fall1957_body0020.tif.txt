the wedding gilt

minutes more and he’d be close enough to the house
to park the car.

Having Ethyl write her sister Betty had been
a clever move, too. Joe had suggested that Ethyl
ask Betty and her husband to come to Kersey and
help them celebrate their anniversary. Betty had
written her acceptance and said she and hubby would
arrive on the 5:20 train. Just about three hours from
now. Ethyl was supposed to pick them up at the rail-
road depot with the station wagon, but when she didn’t
show up Jim and Betty would catch a cab... run
out to the house. They’d find Ethyl dead... call
the Police. And they in turn, when they came look-
ing for Joe, would find him calmly seated in front
of the mike sending his spiel of nonsensical chatter
out over the ether. Brainy, huh?

All Joe had to worry about was not being seen
or recognized while he was away from the studio.
The rest would take care of itself. All except the

tape of his voice. But he could erase that when he |

got back to the station.

Joe was on his own street now, just two blocks

from home.: Slowly he guided the car in against the
eurb ... shut off the motor. He eased the car door
shut behind him ... cut through the vacant lot...
and, coat flapping around his legs, trotted down the
alley that ran behind his house.

Joe could see the yellow-lighted bedroom window
shining faintly through the white-blanketed blackness
of night and he surmised that Ethyl was probably
reading; waiting until it was time to go to the
station.

He trod the steps slowly .. . cautiously ... one
at a time ... entered by the rear door. Joe knew
the location of each piece of furniture in the house
and moved noiselessly through the rooms... up
the stairs .. . down the hall, until he was outside the
door to their bedroom. He opened the door without
a sound and looked at Ethyl propped up against
the cushions on the bed. She was intensely absorbed
with a condensed version of Readers Digest Novels.
As yet, she was unaware of Joe’s presence and his
eyes unhurriedly took in the features and body he
had grown to hate violently: the chestnut brown
hair tightly put up in curlers... the grease smeared
face, plain and unattractive ... the body grown flab-
by, uneared for . . . the checkered bathrobe and
neck-high cotton nightgown. God.! Why couldn’t
she be as attractive and sweet smelling as Nicci.
Nicci, the beautiful. Nicci, his love, the girl he had
met one night in Joe-Joe’s Bar and Grill over on the
other side of town.

Ethyl sensed his presence ... threw the book into
her lap. Her clenched fist, baby-like, shot to her
mouth and she bit hard to stifle the scream of terror

that rose chokingly in her throat. She could taste
the saltiness of blood with her tongue. ‘‘My God,
Joe,’’ she gasped. ‘‘What are you trying to do?
Scare me to death? Why aren’t you at work?’’

‘‘Sorry, hon,’’ Joe said, smiling as he walked
slowly across the bedroom. ‘‘Terry dropped in a
little bit ago. Said a man should have a couple of
night hours with his wife on their anniversary.”’
Joe chuckled and Ethyl toyed with a smile shyly.
She held her arms out to Joe. ‘‘You silly darling,’’
she murmured huskily. ‘‘Come here to mama.’’

Joe sat down on the bed and his arms shot out;
quickly his strong fingers closed around Ethyl’s
throat. Tighter and tighter they squeezed and Joe
felt a perverse delight begin to suffuse his body. His
wife’s brown eyes bugged wide with terror and she
thrashed wildly from beneath the covers and the
green, silk spread. Her thick, heavy thighs flashed .
.. the rumpled, flower-printed nightgown around her
hips. Feet lashed out... caught Joe in the stomach.
He grunted in agony and his grip relaxed momen-
tarily, but it was enough, Ethyl tore loose... .
threw herself out of bed... raced for the open door.

Joe ignored the pain and darted in pursuit.
The hall was dark, except for the flood of light
pouring out of the bedroom, and as he raced down
the carpeted corridor he could hear Ethyl’s bare feet
thudding on the steps. Joe hurled himself down...
five and six at a time... caught her just as she
struggled to unlock the front door. Joe’s arms
wrapped around Kthyl’s flabby waist and violently
he tore her away ... threw her through the archway
into the living room. Ethyl fell heavily to the floor

. screamed shrilly .... ©‘ Youvre crazy... .
erazy. My God, Joe, what’s got into you? What
are you trying to do? You/’re ecrazy.’’

Joe’s breath tore at his throat. His body flew
through the air . .. landed heavily on hers . { .
pinned her kicking legs to the floor.

Ethyl screamed again, ‘‘Don’t ... oh, for God’s
sake, Joe... don’t.’’

Joe’s groping hands found her throat . . fingers
closed tight . . . squeezed . . . tighter and harder.
Kthyl’s scream changed to a sickening wheeze .. .
fainter ... fainter. Her struggles grew weaker...
less violent. Harder and harder he squeezed while
her face mottled deep, dark purple. And then she
was still. Ethyl was dead. And Joe was free.

Joe rose and with fear tearing at his heart ran
to the back door. Had anybody heard her scream?
Cautiously he let himself out ... stared into the
fog. Everything seemed O.K. Nobody had heard
her.

Joe Jumped off the porch to the sidewalk...
