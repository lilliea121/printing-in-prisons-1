Boy! It’s getting late. I’'d better hustle
back to the office. I was suppose to speak
to at least ten persons today.

Well, that says quite a lot for the sub-
ject at hand.

reporter:

professor:

Thank you, professor, [ can’t say that I
agree with all of your reasoning but ’m
proud of objectivity. Of course, you
know our paper would never accept your
views.

reporter:

professor: What did you say your name was again?

reporter: I didn’t sir, but it’s Ignoramus. J. B.

Ignoramus.

professor: That figures. Good day, my good man,
and may the blessings of ignorance go
with you. By the way, when you get
back to the office, look up the word

misosophist.*

reporter: Thank you. I’ll do that.

*Note: Misosophist, hater of wisdom.

MEDITATION OF GOOD
WILL FOR ALL BEINGS

May all beings be happy and serene!

May they be joyous and lve in safety!

All beings, whether weak or strong,

Small or great, without exception,

In high, niddle, or low realms of existence,
Visible or invisible, near or far,

Born or yet to be born:

May all beings be happy and at their ease.
Let none deceive another,

Nor despise any being in any state.

Let none in anger or ill will wish harm to another,

Even as a mother watches over her child,
her only child,

So with boundless mind should one cherish
all living things.

Radiating friendliness over the whole world,
above, below, and all around without limit.
So let us cultivate boundless good will.

— META SUTA (Buddhist)

AS EOIUNT LO BONDER . |. .

A prosperous man visits a long time friend and
says, ‘‘I am a humble man and owe my success and
happiness to my ever present state of humility.’’

‘“Then, why don’t you join me here?’’ his friend
replied.

‘‘Whatever possessed you to make a horrid state-
ment like that?’’ the perplexed visitor asked.

‘‘Because my friend,’’ the profound thinker an-
swered, ‘‘be it ever so humble, there is no place more
humble than a penitentiary !’’

—Frank Rouse

Eastern Echo/January, 1967

PUINGHOUS 2 oo 5

One cruel, cutting cutting word;
Then a lashing torrent.

A loved one cringes from

The hammering onslaught.

Inke falling glass;

Shattering the stillness

Of the mght.

—Frank Rouse

VERDI

Have you ever thought of a colors flavor?
Wondered what food has rts colors savor?

What tastes black or red? What tastes yellow?

This problem can make a bumpkin of most any fellow.

Perhaps at last I have found the one,

That tastes as tt looks sitting out in the sun.

A vegetable of which I am not very keen,
Celery is its name, a taste of green green green.

Wallander

NO TITLE

The joy and pleasure of your company,
Haunts me for my complacence in the past,
For reflection, produces joy and anger.
Both compete for control,

First one, then the other.

To remain whole in a half world,

One must not forget,

The wall is only skin deep.
