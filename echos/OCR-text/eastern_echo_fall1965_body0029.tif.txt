ed in the planning of this project, and rehabilitation

Vocational rehabilitation will be includ-

concepts and principals will thus go into many public
and private programs aimed at prevention, treatment

and control of crime.

One reason for this lack of emphasis on public of-
fenders has been uncertainty as to the extent and na-
ture of their disability. To understand this, it is
necessary to look at the eligibility requirements of the
State-Federal program. The regulations governing the
program specify that, to be eligible for service, an in-

(WL) Ele

must have a physical or mental disability which re-

dividual must meet the following conditions:

sults in functional limitations or limitation of activi-
(2) The functional limitations must result in a
(3) There

must be a reasonable expectation that vocational re-

ties;

substantial handicap to employment; and

habilitation services may render the individual fit to
engage in a remunerative occupation.

In considering the offender as a candidate for the
program the various Rehabilitation agencies undoubt-
edly face frequent difficulties, particularly in terms of
conditions one and three. Is there, in fact, a describ-
able disability with resultant functional limitations—is
a question frequently considered.

This leads to consideration of a second factor—
which has impeded large scale rehabilitation program
in the correctional areas—the question of the **worth”’
or ‘‘deservingness”’ of the convicted offender as a
client in the program. Public attitudes toward the of-
fender do pose problems for the professional as well
as the layman.

It is important to note that hard realities are in-
volved in this ussue. The problems are (1) there is a
mounting backlog of eligible people who are not reach-
ed by the program and (2) hardening debt situations
which make it increasingly difficult for some State
agencies to find funds in sufficient amounts to match
those available from Federal sources. Consequently,
we find State programs faced with burgeoning case-
loads, insufficient funds, and staff shortages.

There are obviously many offenders who have such
clear-cut disabilities as mental retardation, psychosis,
and psychoneurosis upon which eligibility can be bas-
ed. Even those who have no flagrant physical or men-
tal condition may, with intensive psychiatric or psy-
chological evaluation, be shown to have describable
emotional disabilities which are limiting and handi-
capping within the definition applied by the Federal-
State program.

The decision to declare the offender eligible for
service will ultimately be based on a judgment of

feasibility; that is, on the probability that rehabilita-
tion services will put him on the job. In these pro-
jects, it is possible to defer a determination of eligi-
bility until services have been provided to demonstrate
the client’s feasibility for rehabilitation. As more of-
fenders prove to be amendable to rehabilitation, they
may inevitably be up-graded on the priority scale of
cases chosen by the State agencies for service. ;
The Federal-State vocational rehabilitation program
undoubtedly holds the potential for making a major con-

premises: (1) Many offenders are disabled persons |
who are eligible for vocational rehabilitation services;
(2) The program provides an array of services design-
ed to assist disabled persons to become employed;
(3) There are ways in which the program can effective-
ly complement existing correctional programs in both
preventive and remedial efforts; (4) By augmenting
the vocational potential of a given offender, agency
efforts can increase the probability of his making a

successful adjustment to the community.

In concluding this discussion on VOCATIONAL RE-
HABILITATION, you, the interested or the prospective
applicant for this program, will be interested to know
that rehabilitative and correctional services are al-
ready joining hands in three areas. First, there is the
ever closer working relationship between special edu-
cation and vocational rehabilitation programs across
the ‘country. Second, many correctional institutions
provide rehabilitation services, in some degree, as a
part of their intramural program. Third, there appears
to be a closer relation between vocational rehabilita-
tion and the probation function of Municipal, State, and

this topic of Vocational Rehabilitation....because of
high crime rates....which are getting higher each year.
The problem of crime is associated with the more gen-
ral problems of proverty, unemployment and social
disadvantages. This should be of concern to everyone.
To relate the matter more directly to the mission of
the Federal-State agencies, we may see that evidence
is rapidly accumulating to suggest that vocationally
oriented services can play a vital role in contributing
to the social adjustment of the public offender. We
might see this work as providing an opportunity to
make visible the significance of the vocational reha-
bilitation process in dealing with one of the major so-
cial problems of our time!

This is not a social program; nor is it a welfare or
social security program. It is intended as a means of
helping the patient become independent—(con’d next Pg.)
