Doctor Blumberg stated that he was pleased that
the men were so exact in their attendence and had
put their interest in such a fine and worthy cause.

Equally pleased was Superintendent Rundle as he
made the following statement: ‘‘He was happy to see
the men take an interest in a program which not
only was beneficial to the men in the program, but
perhaps could serve a useful purpose in the future to
someone who did not gain the knowledge from at-
tending our Civil Defense Program.”’

‘ERRORS ’

You will certainly find
Bal Oe? Oe wy iin tie
‘“Echo,”’ but they serve a
definite purpose. They
are dedicated to those
persons who are always
looking for the faults of
others — they won't be
disappointed.

You Think It’s Easy?

Publishing this magazine is no picnic.
If we print jokes, people think we are silly;
If we don’t, they say we are too serious.

If we don’t accept contributions, we don’t appreciate
true genius.

If we do print “The Echo” it’s filled with junk!

If we clip things from other magazines, we're too lazy
to write them;

If we don’t, we are stuck with our own horrible stuff.
If we edit the other fellow’s stuff, we're too critical;
If we don’t, we're asleep.

Now some character will probably say | swiped this from

some other publication. — | DID.

The Ten Commandments of Prison

|. Thou shalt respect the rights of thy fellow pris-
oner, giving unto him the same consideration which
thou desirest for thyself.

2. Honor the rules and regulations, lest thy time be
prolonged in this land to which the judge has sent
thee.

3. ‘Thou shalt mind thy own business, lest thy pro-
boscis (nose) be scarred by the blows of thy fellow-
man.

4. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy

neighbor, lest thou be branded all the days that thou
dwellest here.

5. Thou shalt not steal thy neighbor's weed, nor
his pipe, nor his blankets, lest thou awaken some
night and find thyself stripped of thy dearest posses-
sions.

6. Thou shalt not “BUM RAP,” lest thy fellow in-
mates shun thee like the plague.

7. De the work which is allotted thee, lest thou find
thyself among the humble toilers of the BRICKPILE

gang.
8. Incur not the wrath of thy superiors, lest thou be
cast into the darkness of the hole.

9. Honor these commandments and refuse them
not, lest thou suffer great disappointment on the day
thou meetest the Parole Board.
