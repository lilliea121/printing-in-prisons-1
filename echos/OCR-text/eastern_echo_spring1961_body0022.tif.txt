Inmate No. X-9999 was an absolute genius, rated by
the psychologists of the Mideastern Correctional In-
stitution as having an LQ. of 2694. Unfortunately,
X-9999 was also a homicidal maniac as proven by his
identification of the lower left-hand portion of the
third inkblot in the Rorschach test.

‘“‘Dat reminds me of an open umbrella,’’ said X-
9999 with no realization that his unwitting psycholog-
ical faux pas had branded him as a psychopathic, par-
anoid personality with undertones of schizophrenia
and overtones of ergophobia. Of course, the fact that
his erime had involved the annihilation of twenty-nine
people (removing from the map the village of Pine
Cone, Pennsylvania) was also a factor in his classi-
fication as a rather anti-social indiv.dual.

In immediate recognition of his talents (asa genus,
not a maniac), X-9999 was assigned to general main-
tenance. Soon, he was deeply engaged in repairing the
three TV sets for the reereation room with the aid
of an old 1.C.S. manual and the 93rd. volume of the
Encyclopedia Brittanica. When asked by the various
officials how he was coming along, X-9999 would smile
inscrutably and go on with his work. Recognizing an
inscrutable smile as an invariable sign of genius, they
would nod their heads in satisfaction and go about
their business. In fact, X-9999 so impressed everyone
with his eagerness that they allowed him to work in his
cell where he wouldn’t be disturbed by people who
kept asking him such things as ‘‘ What is the atomic
weight of Lanthanum ?’’ ‘‘—139.92.’’ would reply X-
9999—or any other mundane questions.

During all this time, by the simple expedient of at-
tending sick call twice a week, arguing the merits of
Bull Durham as versus those of Target tobacco, and

denouncing the Communist, Socialist, Democratic,
Republican and Prohibitionist parties on any and all
occasions, he was able to keep hidden the fact that he
was actually applying his genius to the perfection of
a fool-proof escape plan.

On Wednesday, July 10, 1961, X-9999 waited until
the guard had made his check and then brought forth
from its hiding place a certain copy of ‘‘ Astounding
