Dear Reader:

iis hie = Wamtern or
1958 issue of the ECHO,
carries a theme of Mod-
crm IPEMOlOw yy. Wacn
article in this issue was
proposed as a reminder
to society that Modern
Penology is the present
day trend in prison
management.

Have we in Pennsyl-
vania advanced our
prison system? A good
beginning in finding the
answer is to carefully
read, The Right to Life,
EXCEPT, by Editor
Cuff, on P-4. Erle Stan-
ley Gardner’s The Fork
In The Road, on P-6,
gives us some of the
Factors —f0 © Onsid er,

On P-8, we offer to
the People of Pennsyl-
vania, Some Things To
Think About.

Shortly before his
deathy = Rope = Bis  Xxeii
offered a special prayer
for prisoners all over
the world. Our Catho-
lic Chaplain, Rev. John
J. McHugh, submitted
this prayer to us for
publication. It appears
on P-15.

On P-18, you’ll find
an amusing Satire of a
Conviets First Day in
Free Society.

Fiction is well repre-
sented in three original
stories which we hove
you will enjoy. To
make you laugh, we
have begun a _ humor
page featuring the car-
toons and gags of our
laughmaster, Bob
Cullen. His Pen-Grins
will be found on P-383.

With this issue we
abe 1 1d) UW Oe Gamer mee
a Situations Wanted
feature, endeavoring to
help those inmates who
have been granted pa-
role, subject to a suita-
ble parole plan, but who
have been unable to ob-
tain employment. You
will find this feature on
the inside of the back
cover.

We invite your com-
ments.
