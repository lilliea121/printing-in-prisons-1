fellows in the audience. Mr. Dolson first became
aware of the sports program when he brought a
softball team in to challenge the inmates here. He
told us frankly, that he never knew any games ex-
isted here before. That shocked some of us slightly
because sports has been a most predominant thing
here. None the less after the game several weeks to
be exact, he wrote a most stirring column which
stirred the entire inmate body. On behalf of the in-
mates here, C. C. Clark stood before the audience of
more than two hundred and thanked Mr. Dolson for
his kind and warm praise in the article. ’'m quite
certain this reached the heart of the sports writer,
and as one he was sincerely applauded by all. Indeed
it was a tremendous ovation to be sure. A point of
interest to this reporter was the statement that
Mr. Dolson made admitting that he dosen’t care too
much for professional basketball, or its interest. No
doubt he has personal reasons for his statements.
The final visiting speaker was Mr. Tom Ferrick of
American League pitching fame and now pitching
coach for the Detroit Tigers. He told us some of his
pitching feats and other highlights in his American
League career. All warm and exciting stories of
players he encountered on and off the field of play.
His main concern today is the future of the Tigers
as a playing unit and as a contender for this year’s
pennant race. He firmly believes that Detroit can
win the flag by the good hustling of the up and com-
ing youth movement from the minor leagues. If the
1961 season was any of the Tigers hustle, then he may
be right. I for one hope so. To Mr. Tom Ferrick and
all Detroit fans, don’t forget the Yankees who reign
in the same league.

Superintendent A. T. Rundle gave the closing ad-
dress, prior to the presentation of trophies to the
various athletes for outstanding performances during
the 1961 season. Mr. Rundle stressed in his address
to the inmate body, that he fervently wants more
and more fellows participating in the various games
and sports that are being played at this institution.
He wants them to show a far greater interest than
ever before and play the games fair, hard and clean,
with good sportsmanship on and off the field. For
this builds a man’s character and molds it for the day
of release. When the rules of the game are deeply set
with the man then the rules of life are much easier
to cope with when he is released. With great con-
viction in his speech, he made known to all within
his voice range that he would do his utmost to have a
better program in sports. First the inmates them-
selves must show by performance their interest. This
brought forth a standing ovation by everyone in the
auditorium that evening. In concluding his address
he clearly stated that when next year rolls around,

he wants to see not two hundred, but four hundred
men, at the banquet. From where I sat, he meant
every word. Before the distinguished guest departed,

After the presentation Mr. Byron left us with a
parting message, wherein he said, “Men we come to
the end of a wonderful evening and hope to come
back next year, if not sooner. In the meantime I wish
each and everyone good luck and God speed.” With
that message still lingering in the air, each guest
filed out with the applause from us, ringing in their
ears. Indeed it was truly a wonderful evening. @
