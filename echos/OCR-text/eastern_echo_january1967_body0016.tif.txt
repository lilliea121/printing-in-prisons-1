to make of events of two thousand years ago more
than history—supernatural, mythological. This, in
turn, makes the entire episode unintelligible to mod-
ern man. Bishop Robinson insists that Jesus of
Nazareth was not a God nor a supernatural being
invested with earthly garb, above the sum of things.
Jesus of Nazareth was the greatest example in bib-
lical history of absolute immersion of self into the
ground of being. In this incarnation, Jesus becomes
God. A thing said well is genius. A thing said ex-
ceptionally well is God! (emphasis added)

As stated earlier, these are, indeed, weighty mat-
ters worthy of serious attention. If this writer enter-
tained any doubt on this score, long ago, he would
have invoked James Gould Cozzen’s atheistic epithet
which is quoted here only to show how narrow
minded and mean some of our modern writers are
when it comes to religion:

“As hypocrisy is the homage vice pays to
virtue; Religion is the homage nonsense
pays to sense.”

But Bishop Robinson deserves better and he must
be accepted on his own terms and on the basis of
what he is attempting to accomplish, ie., to demy-
thologize Christianity; to discover God and to rede-
fine him. There is no mythology nor ambiguity in
the Bishop’s restatement of God. All is clear!

Restatement : God is ultimate reality.
Question: What is ultimate reality?
Answer: The ground of Our Being.

We have now abandoned all obscurantism and
superstition and have discovered the God of the
Bible who “conquers power and space by his
weakness!” (direct quote)

Bishop Robinson is a cool one. Icily he strips away
the fat and flab of superstitious Christiology. He is
not, however, above introducing into his script, lan-
guage of striking lyricism, heavy with erotic religi-
ousity—almost mystical in its fervor as when he im-
passionately describes that “depth of God” which
underlies his thesis: “God is Depth! God is deep.
Deep, the opposite of shallow; deep—opposite of
high; deep is truth! Deep is suffering. Deep—the
depth out of which the psalmist cries to God! God
is of deep things, the inexhaustible mystery of life;
the ultimate meaning of existence, power and uncon-
ditional devotion; intimation of eternity; awareness
of unconditionality, numinousity, ecstasy!”

And, of course, the Bishop is fully backed up by
holy writ when he disclaims the divine nature of
Jesus Christ and repudiates such childishness as
Jesus’ temporary visitation on earth as being an
episode in which Jesus was sent from heaven by God

as Son and envoy. Doesn’t the New Testament state
unequivocally that Jesus was the word of God; God
was in Christ? The spirit of translation from the
Greek runs: “And what God was, the word was.”
Jesus was the complete expression of God. Jesus
said: “If I claim anything for myself, do not believe
me.” Jesus referred to himself as “the son of man”
(Mark 14:61), never, the “son of God.” Others said
that about Jesus—as, indeed, they are still saying
to this day!

We, thus, have come full circle and ask the Bishop
to tell us in one fell swoop: Which way to God? The
Bishop answers obliquely, like going up the down
stairs: “Love is of God—this idea touches funda-
mental reality in the universe and the ultimate char-
acter of being.”

Alas, Bishop, on what terrestrial or subterranean
shores may we find God.

Bishop: “The infinite world points beyond itself
and is self-transcendent. The Divine is found in the
ecstatic character of this world!”

“But where, Bishop, where?”

Bishop: “Search the scripture, Psalm 189—‘God is
in every direction... ”

“Honest To God” is heady stuff. When the book
was first published several years ago, it sent shock
waves throughout the Christian world, particularly
in the United States. The impact was of such di-
mensions as to prompt Bishop Robinson to write a
fatter, weightier sequal to explain it. Some of the
most brilliant religious minds of the day are grap-
pling with the serious matters ventilated in Honest
To God. Indeed, these matters push thought beyond
the frontiers of Christian orthodoxy. All of this may
be exciting and momentous for some—and thank
goodness for them! Nevertheless, as a person of in-
different religious interests, this writer finds Bishop
Robinson's @ la Paul Mich s) Ground of Our
Being” as elusive and meaningless as he finds prim-
itive and irrelevant to life, the traditional, super-
natural concept of “God out there” or wherever.

Protestant Chaplains.)
