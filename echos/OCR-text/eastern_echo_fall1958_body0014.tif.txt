Responsibility comin

spoke out against the persons who prejudged any
any offender. He properly felt that his job was to
represent his clients to the best of his ability as the
Courts were charged with the pronouncement of
judgement.

Mental capacity is important but not to the ex-
tent to excuse absolutely. If all men, no matter the
circumstances, had counsel, mitigating factors could
be properly developed and offenders sent to the
proper institutions for treatment if required. This
inures to the benefit of the defendant, and society
would be saved from subsequent serious heinous
offenses if the offender were permitted to continue
unchecked and untreated. Former Justice Cardozo
wrote of the “Tyranny of Labels” which seems ap-
plicable to the question of criminal insanity. Ab-
struse reasoning and “labels” have distorted “right
and wrong” to the utter and abject confusion of a
lay jury. In 1868 in Mass. it was stated:

If we should count as insane all grown up per-
sons in the Commonwealth (Mass.) who are not sane
in heart, not sane in conscience, and not sane in
reason, the remainder might be a small minority.
But those only are set down as insane whose mental
facilities are so disturbed that they cannot train in
the social ranks; and who are adjudged by certain
officers to be incompetent for self guidance for the
management of their own affairs. These are ruled
back by the law into the condition of children and
wards.

POST TRIAL

Prisoners are human beings and are keenly
aware of their imprisonment. They accept honest
opinions when seeking advice of counsel in any mat-
ter—civil or criminal. As an example: When an
inmate seeks advice on a proposed petition to the
Board of Pardons, an honest opinion should be giv-
en as to the merits, judging all factors. It is indeed
unfortunate that some lawyers proceed without ex-
amining the full record and without seeking infor-
mation that vitally may affect the reception of such
petition by the Board of Pardons. We have seen
applications (with considerable fee) where no pos-
sible merit existed. Counsel should be frank with
the inmate and so advise him rather than give hope

where none could possibly exist. This is a matter

of Executive Clemency and there should be some-
thing outstanding presented with all of the factors
carefully weighed to merit attention. The same
applies to parole at the minimum date. Counsel
ean be of great value in presenting certain facts to
the Parole Board, but rarely can counsel interfere
with the discretion which is vested by law in the
Parole Board as judgment has already been rend-
ered at sentence. The determination of the Board

is confined to whether the man is able and ready to
resume his place in society. Juthermore the Pa-
role Authorities have facts sometimes not known to
counsel. Lawyers know or should appraise them-
selves of these facts relating to parole procedures.

When advice is sought on a petition for habeas
corpus, honesty and frankness should prevail. This
is not to say there are not some worthy cases as
some should be pursued to the limit where there is
real merit. However, Appellate Court records are
replete with frivolous petitions that obscure the
worthy few.

In presenting these comments, I sincerely hope
they are accepted in the proper spirit. Prisoners
are in many cases greatly misunderstood but there is
one thing certain: they want frankness and an
honest opinion. . Vacillation, no. In summary I sub-
mit that in every phase of criminal proceedings
promises should not be made that cannot be fulfilled
or for which there is no basis in counsel’s best judg-
ment. This is particularly true in appeal matters
which if unwarranted only delay the offender in
facing reality and adjusting to his new situation.
Finality of judgment must take place some time.
Promises that cannot be kept tend to keep the man
upset and unable to adjust because of anticipating
something that cannot materialize or is a waste of
time and money.

In all stages if the prosecutor, defense counsel
and court could maintain the ultimate objective in
mind, i. e., what is best for society and the offender,
and not be overzealous beyond need, having as a
polestar, “justice”, no offender could look back with
misgivings, wondering, “What is Justice.”

To conclude, I should like to propose, without
presumption, that Men of Law broaden their know-
ledge beyond that obtained in law schools. This is
particularly important to those who lean to the
practice of criminal law. So many lawyers avoid
this field as though it were a plague and not be-
fitting them. Perhaps that is why it has not at-
tained the level it should. After all, this field affects
us vitally dealing as it does with humanity, and life
and liberty upon which rests the foundation of good
government. Law schools now offer courses in
Legal Medicine, Psychiatry and allied fields. Every
lawyer interested in criminal law should study
prisons and prison philosophy. That in addition to
being a place as (not for) punishment, it also has a
more important role—to prepare the offender to re-
sume a useful place in society. How many Men of
Law really know the real purpose of imprisonment
beyond the punishment and deterrent purpose?
When those so vitally involved in criminal process
begin to fully understand this, society will profit im-
measurably and perhaps give a helping hand to the
unfortunate even after release, providing, of course,
the offender exhibits a sincere desire to prove his
worthiness. Civilization has advanced  tremen-
dously—Has it here?
