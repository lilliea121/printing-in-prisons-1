The Gods of Mirth marked this one

of larceny screamed, ‘And Qurs!”’

In the long history of rogues, rascals and seal-
lawags, perhaps none has ever been more compas-
sionately and amusingly brought to life than Arlan
Grover Cleveland J. Von Schaedler, known to his
fellow prisoners here as ‘‘The Preacher’’. Reference
is made to the factual biographical sketch, as well
as a full biography in process of being written, by
inmate George Makin.

None of us relish judgment of our parts, those
damning segments of our lives. All of us perhaps
hope that someday the inestimable kindness will be
done to us, that someone troubles to see our lives
whole and from that majestic perspective realize
the melody of personality and character which .. .
yes, required our very lifetime to evolve. A lesser
scope of sight diminishes insight into judgment, the
kind we all have both suffered and made, yet be-
neath which who is there can stand.

In light of judgment, Arlan Von Schaedler is,
or was, without a doubt a rogue. A merry one, but
definitely. Born under the Belt Line Bridge on the
outskirts of the ‘‘ quiet little town of Hamburg, Pa.,”’
the gods of mirth marked this one as their own,
while legions of larceny screamed, ‘‘And ours!’’
At the same time in her horsedrawn sleigh enroute
to a “‘frolic and’’, his 800 pound momma must have
also claimed him at once as her very own. Not to
be outdone, the proud and surprised papa, ‘‘Hap’’
Schaedler, might well have said, ‘‘A-men!’’

Makin records that Arlan reached the singular
height of second grade before being expelled from
school. But naturally, for stealing bull frogs. Then
follows a stint with Childrens Aid when momma art-
fully put him through an open window. Mere

happenstance that the house belonged to another
family and that a ‘‘curious cop mistook them for
gypsies’’ when they moved away, carting ‘‘bag and
baggage’’.

In a matter of days, the Schaedler ‘‘brood”’ re-
grouped in Shoemakerville, but the grocery stores
could not stand the strain and 3 weeks later momma
and papa, the little Schaedlers, and Arlan, too, were
sent packing out of town. Or perhaps it was the
restaurants which found too often that during mom-
ma’s colossal fainting spell the check somehow never
seemed to get paid. Or it might have been the shoe
and clothing stores that suddenly ‘‘came to real-
ize’’. ““The performance was good most anywhere.’’

Comfortably nestled back in Hamburg in a
large frame house, three stories high, and just as
snug as a bug in a rug they didn’t have’’, everything
went well until the critical visit of the landlord
who, in toasting himself before the cheery fire, some-
how found when his head lay back that he could see
the roof! Unpleasant fellow that he was, he asked
Arlan’s papa, ‘‘My, vot’s hoppened, Hop? Dere’s
no shtairs leading hup da shtep!’’ Papa’s quick
thinking hustled the bewildered landlord out, but
the happy spell was broken and the Schaedler’s
moved out ... just before the large house collapsed.
“It vas a bad house. I’m glad I movft avay from
it,’? commented Arlan’s papa. But it had been
warm. The second and third floors, beams, furniture
and woodwork, not to mention all those lovely 2 x 4’s
underneath the plaster, or the doors and window
frames and—as the observant landlord noted—the
stairs, had helped insure at least that much!

Of course, Arlan knew tribulations, like having
