ECHO IN
RETROSPECT

by ROBERT D. HEINEMANN

How does one set out to examine a prison maga-
zine from its initial issue two years ago, through
its Winter of ’57 edition? A literary review would
tell us some things, but perhaps the crux of the mat-
ter lies deeper.

Deep within whatever tradition it has estab-
lished .. . in ECHO’s case, an inmate-centered one.

Deep within the personalities responsible for
the editorial policies which formed and kept that
tradition.

Deep within their thoughts, decisions, acts and
influences, their spoken and printed words which
moulded those policies.

Yet how deep should one writer presume to go
into such matters? Perhaps a set of notes with some-
thing left to the other fellow’s judgment would be
most appropriate.

It should be axiomatic that the caliber of a pris-
on magazine reflects the measure of responsible free-
dom granted to it, as well as the abilities of its
inmate staff.

ECHO really began as an abortion. In which
deliberate failure probably laid much of the basis
of whatever success the magazine later enjoyed. As
planned and even as material for a first issue was
being collected in September-October 1955 by its co-
founders, Andre L. Paschedag and William Cress-
man, it was wisely decided to scuttle and disband it
before the appearance of a single issue. I say wisely
because it is the consensus that this decision helped
clarify the matter of censorship before it could de-
teriorate into ‘‘control.’’

With the impetus provided by this spirit, a
second founding occurred some months later, led by
the capable first editor, Jerry Culp, and his two as-
sociates, Cressman, a highly literate young man, and
John L. Williams Jr., a proverbial ball of fire. It is
well to consider this second founding as in a sense
the first: What trials Jerry bore in overcoming re-
luctance and inertia in trying to get the show on the

14

road cannot be over-estimated. Indeed, as one of
his contributors I must admit I was remarkably
inert, and reluctant to ‘‘take a chance’’ on a largely
unknown and still somewhat indeterminate situation
which in part characterized the magazine. With pa-
tience and firm tact, Culp and his associates nursed |
the March 1956 issue into being.

That the integrity of a prison magazine is never
finally won or earned, Jerry knew. It can be lost,
stolen or traded away in one mistake, one unfavor-
able official decision. In pointing up just one aspect
of this bitter truth, Jerry immortalized himself in
ECHO’s first, and his only editorial.

‘c .. The EASTERN ECHO is your magazine.
It will only be as good as you want it to be. (It) is
intended to be the voice of the men...

‘c. Keep this magazine as the voice of all the
men ...and not of just one group ... Make the
EASTERN ECHO broad and progressive in its out-
look. Keep in mind the man who will occupy your
cell after you’ve been released—and the man after
him. Guard this tiny flame of yours against the glory
seeker and the irresponsible. ..’’

He neglected to say that the glory seeker and
the irresponsible could appear from other than in-
mate ranks. Still, the second and third editors were
moved to look back upon the ‘‘Culp Word’’ as a
eatechism of ECHO tradition itself.

Immediately after this single issue, Jerry gained
his freedom via parole and the second editor, Joe
Corvi, assumed command, with future editor No. 3,
myself, as an added associate. Cressman and Will-
lams remained at their editorial posts. In his brief
tenure of office Corvi, a great strapping fellow with
drive and determination, furthered the magazine in
many ways. He added the feature, now familiar,
known as ‘‘Spotlght.’’ He fired at least this former
associate with a concept of public relations. And it
was Corvi who continued the tradition by fighting
for all of us the battle against the sole attempt to
blue-pencil the magazine. He resigned after a single
issue.

The Fall of ’56 issue was, then, the first set up
