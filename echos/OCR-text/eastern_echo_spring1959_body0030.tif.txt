BEST TAIL FORWARD

by JAMES "Mike" SMITH

The “Darwinian Ex-
plorer’” rose from _ its
launching pad at 1430
hours. By 14385 hours it
was, in the language of
the technicians, a full-
fiedged “bird.” <A direct
wire to the Capitol Build-
ing was utilized to inform
the President and a se-
lect group of Republican
senators that our latest
balaneed - budget - break-
er was successfully blast-
ing its way into the wild
blue yonder.

Ruefully cancelling

= r his golf appointment for
that afternoon, the President called a press confer-
ence. Following the administration’s policy of bi-
partisan participation in national affairs, reporters
from both Republican and Democratic newspapers
‘were permitted to attend. When refused entry, a
protest was lodged by the local representative of
“Pravda,” but was disallowed because of his admit-
ted allegiance to an organization frowned upon by
the Un-American Activities Committee.

After a short delay caused by a temporary mal-
function of the teleprompter, the President greeted
the assembled reporters with his usual appealing
smile and made his opening remarks.

“Tiadies and gentlemen of the press. I wish to
announce that this afternoon the United States suc-
cessfully launched a rocket which has the capability
of reaching the planet Mars. The latest indications
are that this rocket, the ‘Darwinian Explorer,’ will
successfully fulfill its mission. Since the rocket has
as a passenger a small but highly adventurous mon-
key, the accomplishment of this mission will make
the United States the first nation on earth to have
placed a living organism on a foreign planet.”

They shot a rocket into the air, where it fell they know
not where, We lose more damn rockets that way,—
monkeys too!

To quell the uproar which followed this an-
nouncement, the President’s Press-Secretary indi-
eated that the question period was now open. In
order of seniority the reporters addressed their
questions to the President from the floor.

“Mr. President, may we accept this to mean that
the American way of life has proven its superiority
by demonstrating the worthlessness of such cheap
Russian propaganda tricks as their satellite around
the sun?”

“Mr. President, what effect do you believe this
rocket will have on the 1960 elections?”

“Mr. President, certain critics of the foreign aid
program have intimated that our entire space pro-
gram is merely an underhanded effort to discover
more countries to whom we can give our money.
Would you care to comment?”

“Mr. President, have you seen Mr. Hoffa’s state-
ment in which he regards the use of monkeys as an
NAM plot to wreck the test pilots’ union?”

“Mr. President, speaking of monkeys, Mr. Harry
Golden, editor of the ‘Carolina Israelite,’ last week
voiced his fears that if such a monkey were to land
on an inhabited planet, the inhabitants would mis-
takenly accept the animal as a representative of the
human race, and perhaps refuse to make further con-
tact with us because of the animal’s stupidity. Do
you have a comment?”

Just wait until the SPCA hears about this.

After fifteen minutes of such questions and com-
patible answers, the President nodded to his secre-
tary, who signaled the end of the conference. At his
signal the senior member of the press corps rose and
said loudly, “Thank you, Mr. President.” This for-
mally indicated the end of the meeting, and also al- —
lowed the senior member to get a head start in the
mad dash for the telephones in the lobby.

When the room had been cleared, the President
looked at his watch. He smiled and said, “It’s only
ten after three. I can still get in nine holes after all.”

Some time later the Prime Consul of the Martian
Central Congress met with his cabinet and scientific
advisors to discuss the latest reports from the Main
Observatory. The newly appointed ezar of the “Spa-
tial Integration Bureau” opened the meeting.

“Planet #3 has recently evinced an interest in
spatial integration as reported by our observatories.
While their efforts toward space travel have been
rather juvenile compared to those of the civilized
universe, they do indicate that, contrary to our pre-
vious calculations, the natives of Planet #3 do have
some intelligence. To date, the planet has not been
explored by any member of the Galactic League
since it was feared that such premature contacts
would disrupt the natural evolution of that species.
However, because of our reports of their activity, the
League last week granted its approval of our re-
quest to be allowed to make initial contact and sub-
sequently integrate Planet #3. Our expedition was
to leave tonight under the able leadership of Am-
bassador Van Quinnik, but later developments have
caused a change in plans. It seems that the maturity
of the natives of Planet ¢3 has been vastly under-
