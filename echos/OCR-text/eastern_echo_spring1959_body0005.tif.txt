Dear Mr. Cuff:

I am writing for the Lighthouse staff
to thank the committee of the EASTERN
ECHO for the subscription to your maga-
zine.

We shall read it with interest and want
you to know we were proud to receive this
award.

THE LIGHTHOUSE,
Philadelphia, Penna.

@ We are nonored to count THE LIGHT-
HOUSE oganization among our friends.
Your wonderful work should have the
fullest support of everyone.

Dear Sirs:

My Dad, Joe Cederholm, told me about
the chess games played between your men
and the Franklin Mercantile Chess Club
a few weeks ago. These games gave him
much pleasure; he looks forward to another
round of chess with you soon.

He gave me a copy of the ECHO, which
I enjoyed and I would like to read more
issues.

@ The chess games were enjoyed by all,
we’re looking forward to a return match.
Thanks for the plaudits.

Dear Sir:

We cannot help noticing the absence of
the HASTERN ECHO on our exchange
list. We would appreciate an exchange
of publications, effective this month, if
possible.

Congratulations on your many reprints
among Penal Press members, and for your
fine work in promoting the Dorothy Scheer
program last year.

Best of luck to you and the staff through-
out the coming year.

THEY HAVE A POINT

An archaeologist just back from Pompeii
reports that he has dug up an old peni-
tentiary in which he found a lot of petri-
fied prisoners.

In the famed Boot Hill cemetery at
Tombstone, Arizona, where a good many
western bad-men le buried, one epitaph
. recognizes bluntly and simply the error
of society, ‘‘Hanged by Mistake.’’ Those
three words constitute one of the strongest
arguments against capital punishment.

From the Superintendent's Desk:

We must realize that 95% of men are
eventually released from prison. Their accept-
ance if they show good faith is important. They
must eat and earn a living the same as any
other person. We don’t deny that some will
never profit by understanding and a good pro-
gram in prison. I speak of the majority with
whom we are concerned. We have not yet
reached the millenium. We must rid ourselves
of the obsession that the criminal’s guilt, found
or acknowledged, absolves us and absolves so-
ciety from the responsibility for positive regenerative treatment for
him. Such a course will require extensive education, not only of the
public generally, but also of the Bar, the Bench and the Press.

William J. Banmiller

When a Court fixes a sentence, it is in effect predicting a time when
an. offender will be ready to be released. The Psychiatrist does not
venture to foretell on the admission of a patient suffering from a form
of mental illness which he believes to be curable, the precise date when
the patient will be so improved as to warrant his discharge. He will
have procured a detailed medical, mental and social history of the pa-
tient and unlike the Court, he will know intimately the facilities of the
institution and he can control the routine and treatment of the patient
and will himself see him frequently.

Our Criminal law and penological concepts of treament are very
old. It is even today deemed as something eternal and unchangeable.
They have considered the act committed rather than the individual
offender, his make-up and his need for treatment. To administer it was
the comparatively small task of determining guilt then alloting the
dose of punishment to the degree of crime. The criminal act rather
than the criminal was measured.

For this reason, we must recognize that science has entered our
field to a greater degree than ever before. Through Psychiatry, Psy-
chology, Sociology and Social Work, we are now seeing the behavior
of the individual and we have new tools for case study and treatment.
There is a shift in emphasis from the act to the individual, from punish-
ment measured by crime to treatment aimed at readjustment.

Until our sentence structure meets this salutary thinking, we must
do what we can with judicial predictions. At Eastern we set up our
type of custody within a frame-work of a relaxed, informal and less
rigid program than might be expected in the case of institutions which
are housing many serious custodial risks. Yet there is no loss of pro-
tection for the institution and society and good programs, we feel,
are in operation.

HE ES:Re STORY,

The building of E.S.P. was begun in 1822 and the cornerstone was laid on May 22,
1823. The edifice that it marked is the oldest Pennsylvania penal institution in
continuous use since its first prisoner was received on October 25, 1829.
