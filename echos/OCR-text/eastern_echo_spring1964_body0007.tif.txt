is their duty to attack and disparage anything new.

Tradition and habit play important roles in the
history of man. Yet, all the great discoveries, the
social reforms, the scientific breakthroughs, were
made, not by clinging rigidly to the lines of out-

moded tradition, but rather by visualizing something
new, a better system, and daring to cast off the op-

pressive ties of habit and tradition and step forward
into the light of discovery. Unfortunately, it is not
always easy to convince the populace that the new
method is the better method. The adversities suffered
by such men as Galileo, Columbus, Leonardo Da
Vinci, Tom Paine, Copernicus, and many others,
signify man’s resistance to change.

Tradition serves a necessary purpose and we rec-
ognize that certain traditions must stand. We are also
aware that traditions can outlive their usefulness. We
hope that society can find the courage to eliminate its
outworn traditions and cut the antiquated bonds of
penology and surge forward to a new, enlightened
understanding between society and the deviant.

Hundreds of books and millions of words have
been written on the subject of penal reform and
much has been accomplished. Yet, it falls far short
of what is required to significantly affect the crime
rate and recidivism. If society remains apathetic to
the plight of the convicted offender, can it expect a
continuous rise in the crime rate? Indications are that
society can look forward to an increase in crime.
More prisoners are being put into more and more
prisons. This is a clear indication of the need for a
drastic change in the treatment of offenders.

Eastern Echo

It is society that must recognize its responsibility
and be willing to shoulder the burden of reeducating
and retooling offenders to successfully compete in
our most competitive of societies.

At the present time a person is convicted of a
crime and sentenced to a penal institution where he
forfeits—among other things—his right to engage in
productive, gainful employment. In a culture that is
based on the family unit and gainful employment,
this forfeiture might seem justified at first glance. A
second and more penetrating inspection will bring to
light a very serious paradox.

Would anyone seriously consider exposing a pa-
tient with a bad cold to pneumonia in order to cure

the cold?

Would anyone seriously consider exposing an of-
fender to a much larger dose of the economical ad-
versity which already afflicts him in order to affect a
cure?

Obviously, they certainly would. For this is exactly
what society does when it banishes its offenders to a
penal institution and denies them the right to support

themselves and their families. | am referring now to
the offender who, because of financial inadequacy,

turns to crime.

How will prison help him? Will it remove the
cause of his deviation or will it aggravate the very
cause that prompted his deviation ?

And what of the offender who had no pressing
financial problem before his commitment? Will he
find the added burden of enforced pauperism too
