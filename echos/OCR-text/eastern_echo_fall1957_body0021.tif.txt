the Preece

Moonlight flooding a silent room

Liquid silver o’er the countryside

The fragrance of apple blossom perfume
Thriiling the senses in tides

Diamonds in necklaces hung from the shrubs
Designed by the early dew

The tinkle and chatter of nocturnals astir
A nightingale’s song sifting through

The scroll work of cloud sprinkled with stars
Created by the Unseen Hand

Designed by God, displayed to all

beauty unequalled by man

Dedicated A Millie

The letter that you wrote to me
Surprised me to no end

For | thought you had forgotten
My thoughtful, gentle friend

The soft words that you filled it with
Touched deep within my heart

Each punctuated paragraph

Expressive in its art

The human spark of kindness
Lies within each lilting line

| savor every single word

And answer it in kind

| gently place it here among
The treasures | possess
My Bible and my Rosary, in
My velvet treasure chest

EASTERN ECHO

fata

Autumn - Autumn - dancing maiden
Beauteous and color laden

Spectacular in your array
Extravagant in your display

Tresses garlanded — multi-hued
Gowned in finery, imbued

Temporal nymph, enchanting Miss
Arouse me with your frosty kiss

Lull me in your noonday sun
Oh, voluptuous and tempting one

Flee now! before cold winter’s breath
Divest you even unto death

Ah! Autumn - Autumn - dancing maiden

If the best of the best
Met the worst of the worst,
| wonder what the outcome would be.

If the best of the best
Helped the worst of the worst,
Then the worst of the worst would see

_ That the best of the best
Were akin to the worst—
No haughtier than he is he.

Soon the worst of the worst
And the best of the best
Would be one—

And the world would be free.
