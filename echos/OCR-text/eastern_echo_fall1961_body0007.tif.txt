the pace with which he was making them, nor could they afford to bar-
ter their own goods at the low prices he did. The workers also mur-
mured, for they found their wages were small and could not provide
for their wants. And it happened that one of them found that the
Giant was making the goods for the first merchant and this enraged
them. So they went in a body to the governor and made known their
grievance and he took counsel with them and they made law that
henceforth the Giant should not do labour that would interfere with
that of the free men.

So they took and put him in his chains and he lay fallow and his
spirit was twisted by the idleness that lay on his hands, so that each
time he was released he gave vent to his anger and committed acts
that were offensive.

On the 7th of October, 1571, two great fleets met in
a struggle that was to go down in history as the last
erusade, the Battle of Lepanto. The Christian fieet,
under the indirect command of Pope Pius V, was
composed of two hundred galleys and eight galle-
asses, while the Turkish forces, with Ali Pasha as
admiral, numbered two hundred and seventy-three
galleys. In one of the bloodiest engagements on rec-
ord, the Christian forces smashed the Turks and put
a Stop to their transgressions in the Eastern Mediter-
ranean. Garlands were heaped on the brows of Don
John of Austria, Barbargio of Veniec, Gianandrea
Doria of Genoa, Sir Richard Grenville, and Cervantes
for their part in the campaign, but not one rose was
given the criminals of a dozen countries who saved
the Christian world. These nameless ones manned the
oars of the ships that carried the Europeans to viec-
tory. A conservative estimate of the number of con-
victs pulling the sweeps for the winning side would
range in the neighborhood of nine thousand, while
the Turkish oarsmen—obviously an inferior grade of
eriminal—numbered eleven thousand men.

For centuries the Greeks and Romans had used
slaves and prisoners-of-war to work their galley oars,
but as the slaves of the Mediterranean countries were
liberated they were replaced by convicts, this prac-
tice spread throughout the continent and one of the
most horrible forms of prison labor came into exist-
enee. A vivid description of galley life was given by
John Marteilhes in his book Memoirs of a Protestant:
“The prisoners reached the sea-port on foot, travers-
ing a large part of France in scanty clothing and
chained by the neck in large gangs. Once drafted on
board ship, and posted to his bench, he remained
there always, unless taken to the hospital or the
erave. Six slaves, chained to the same bench tugged
at each oar, which was some fifty feet in length; they
were compelled to keep time with the others before

or behind, or they would have been knocked senseless
by the return stroke. They rowed naked to the waist,
partly to save clothing, still more to offer their backs
to the thongs of the quartermaster, who flogged free-
ly, and backed up every order with each stroke. In
all naval engagements of those days, the oars were
shot at first, hence the galley slaves suffered first and
most, and were often decimated while the garrison
and crew escaped untouched.”

After the battle of Lepanto, the use of galleys de-
clined and finally gave way to the use of the fleeter
sailing ship. At the same time the medieval period
was ending and the modern period was beginning.
This shift in eras was accompanied by an increase in
the criminal faction. Despite a flexible death penalty
that terminated many a career, there was still a sur-
plus of criminals, few places to confine them, and
even worse—in the eyes of the warders—no labor to
keep them busy. By the way, when we speak of erim-
inals in this era we are using the term broadly. The
type that we now regard as a vagrant, or beggar, was
the major criminal class of the medieval era. Those
who were apprehended during the commission of a
crime did not have to worry about serving sentences
because they were usually put to death.

“To continue, in 1597, England passed a law that
allowed convicts to be deported to labor in North
America. Portugal had instituted a similar system
over a century before, sending criminals to the Cape
Verdes Islands, Angola Brazil, where they worked,
more or less on fortifications. Spain also tried this
practice and as early as 1497 Ferdinand and Isabella
decreed that certain types of criminals be deported to
the mimes in Hispaniola. Holland, in turn, deported
their felons to labor in the Dutch Kast Indies; the
convicts of Denmark found Greenland their work-
shop, and Italy turned the felon into a farmer on the
