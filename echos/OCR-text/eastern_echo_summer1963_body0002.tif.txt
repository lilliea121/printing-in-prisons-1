the editor speaks...

ae Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.”

| have been associated with the ECHO in various capacities since it
came to life in the Penal Press field in 1956.

This is my first faltering step at editing, and until | can feel the
pulse of the magazine and know we are receiving only an enlightened
censorship and reasonable cooperation from the official family, we will

curtail any editorializing until we have that assurance.

My associates in the print shop have all been most cooperative. The
entire ECHO staff are a hard-working, cooperative crew, and we promise
this: The ECHO ain’t what we want it to be; and it ain’t what it’s gonna
be — but it ain’t wot it wuz.
