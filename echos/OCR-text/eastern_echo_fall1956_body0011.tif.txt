pamphlet, circular or whatever that had been
printed to the nth degree would suffer if in the
process of binding or folding, the men in this de-
partment were not particular with their work.
There are at least two men in this department who
could take the place of their counterparts on the
street and hold their ends up. Since ours is not
a large Bindery the men are instructed and able to
learn all the particular phases of the Bindery
Department.

The Print Shop as a branch of our vocational
training program may be judged by the excellence
of its product and the number of trainees placed and
accepted into the printing industries.

(After 16 years service in our Print Shop, Mr.
Bachman just recently terminated his connection
with the institution. The men of the Print Shop
sincerely wish him continued success.)

to express their appreciation:

Dear Mr. Tredinnick:

It has been some time since I last wrote you,
so I thought it was about time I informed you of
my progress. Also, I’d like to relate a conversation
I had with Howard Wilson, business manager of
the local.

As you know, I’ve been employed continuously
as a linotype operator since my release two and a
half years ago. During that period my salary has
always been over $100 a week; and, I’m pleased to
say, for the past six months I’ve had a day situa-
tion, which, of course, has made a happy change in
my way of living.

Howard Wilson was in the shop the other
day, and I had a chance to talk with him for
a-tew minutes. | asked him about S$ - . — . — —

I said, ‘‘I’m glad to hear that, and I know Mr.
Tredinnick will be, too.’’

He laughed and said, ‘‘Don’t worry about that.

Fred knows all about it. He also knows that every
man he has recommended to the union is working
steadily, and that the union, from Muir (the
president) on down, is 100% behind him.”’

Of course, I’d known about some of the others
you’d helped whom I was personally acquainted

Well, Mr. Tredinnick, Mother just called me for
dinner. However, before closing, I’d like to say
once again how much I’ve appreciated all you’ve
done for me, from the time you first encouraged
me to work on the lnotype machines until the day
after my release when you sent me down to union
headquarters. It never fails to give me a real thrill
when I’ve heard of someone you’ve helped, and
it is my earnest hope that you’ll be able to continue
to do so for a long, long time.

Sincerely,

There is very little I may add that could be
more impressive than the above letter. We often
hear the gripe that society won’t give us a chance.
Let’s try to turn the odds in our favor and return
to society with something to offer and I’m sure that
breaking down the barrier won’t be too difficult.
