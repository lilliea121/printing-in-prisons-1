contribution to any discussion of commutation. His
apt observation is easily confirmed by anyone having
an acquaintance with the news media of today. Pub-
lic opinion must first be formed before it can become
effective. This can be done only by making the sub-

ject a public issue by means of mass communication.
If this is so, one must investigate the motive for

making any subject a public issue in the first place.
Unfortunately it will usually be found that the orig-
nal purpose for stirring up public opinion in any area
in this day and age, is a political one. Political plat-
forms must have planks, and to our regret we often
find that subjects best left outside the political arena
become targets of political discussion. A common
editorial headline is, “Take the politics out of the
Pardon Board.” Ironically, the only politics in the
Pardon Board lies in the fact that it has wrongly be-
come the subject of such editorials by political
writers seeking a “burning issue.”

How effective is sereening by commutation inso-
far as public safety is concerned? Again we turn to
the Prison Journal; this time Mr. Marvin EB. Wolf-
gang, Department of Sociology of the University of
Pennsylvania. He states:

“The rate of failure on parole among those per-
sons whose minimum sentences were commuted is
only half the failure rate of all released prisoners
Om Waieole . . . 5

“Perhaps it is not unexpected that those on pa-
role whose minimum sentences had been commuted
should show a smaller proportion of parole failures,
for their cases have been evaluated by two separate
administrative bodies—first by the Board of Pardons
and then by the Board of Parole. Prisoners whose
appeals were heard, and petitions for commutation
of their minimum sentences granted by the Pardon
Board, and were later released on parole by the Pa-
role Board, have been through two screening agen-
cies and have twice had their institutional records
subjected. to serutiny. The Board of Pardons, by
reason of its function, is the more selective body;
therefore those cases granted a reduction in mini-
mum sentence and subsequently released on parole
should logically be expected to be more successful
than all persons released on parole. The latter group,
after all, is composed of those whose appeals for re-
duction of their minimum sentence had previously
rejected, presumably on the basis of their unfavor-
able past behavior or institutional experience .

Eastern Echo

The fact that there is a statistically significant differ-
ence in the success-failure rate of these two parole
groups, and that the difference is in the direction of
the theoretical expectation, speaks well for the Board
of Pardons.”

Mr. Wolfgang’s study justified statistically the
judgments of the Board of Pardons in releasing men
from prison. All reports to the contrary, the commu-
tation process is not a hit or miss proposition, with a
resultant danger to the public. It may be an expres-
sion of mercy, but commutations are granted as the
result of an inmate’s appeal being considered worth-
while under all possible reasoning, and not as the re-
sult of an emotional appeal to the people concerned.
A little straight-thinking must certainly bring one to
the conclusion that an inmate released after strict
screening is more apt to be qualified to rejoin society,
than one who was not sereened by any board. Pris-
oners serving all their sentences, do so for one and/or
two basic reasons: (1) They have not been found fit
to rejoin society by the sereening agencies of the
Board of Pardons and/or the Board of Paroles. (2)
The pressures of public opinion refused the two
Boards their normal latitude of judgment, and the in-
mate’s appeal was refused as a result of a “Get
Tough” policy. It is the writer’s opinion that in both
instances, the releasee will be more of a threat to the
peace and safety of society, than the man released
earlier through an action of clemency.

In the last analysis, until such time that legis-
lative changes are made in the sentencing procedures
of the Commonwealth’s courts, the Board of Pardons
must be enabled to continue its vital role as the only
recourse open to a prisoner seeking relief from an
excessive sentence, correction of an inequitable sen-
tence, and/or the merciful rejudgment of society.
Arguments pro or con will accomplish nothing bene-
ficial to either the prisoner or society. A closer study
of the facts concerned may do so. We hope we have
successfully accomplished our intention to present
those facts.
