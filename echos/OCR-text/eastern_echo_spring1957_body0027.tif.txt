I was General Santiago Hicks

At the head of a grand revolt,

And my only friend from start to end
Was a punishing Army Colt.

I might have been a president,

A prosperous man of means,

But a gunboat came and blocked my game,
With one hundred and ten Marines.

So I awoke from my dream, dead broke—
Drifted from bad to worse;

Sank as low as a man can go

Who walks with an empty purse.

But stars, they say, appear by day,
When your down in a deep, dark pit;
My lucky star found me that way,
When I was about to quit.

On a fiery hot, flea-ridden cot,

I was down with the Yellow Jack,

Alone in the bush and all but dead,
When she found me and nursed me back.

She came like the miracle man of old
And opened my poor blind eyes,

And upon me shown a bright new dawn,
As I turned my face to the skies.

There was pride and grace in her brown young face,

For hers was the blood of kings,
In her eyes shown the glory of empires gone,
And the secret of world old things.

We were spliced in a Yankee meeting house
On the land of your Uncle Sam,

And J drew my pay from the U.S.A.,

For I worked at the Gatum Dam.

Then the devil sent his right-hand man

(I might have expected he would),

And he took her life with a long, thin knife,
Because she was straight and good.

EASTERN EcHo

Within me died hope, honor, pride,

And all but the primitive will

To hunt him down on his blood-red trail—
Find him and kill, and kill.

Through logwood swamps and chicle camps,
I hunted him many a moon,

And I found my man in long pit-pen,

By the side of a blue lagoon.

The chase was o’er at the farthest shore—
It ended my two years quest,

And left him there with a vacant stare
And John Crow on his chest.

You see these punctures on my arm?
Do you want to know what they mean?
Those marks were left by fingers deft
Of my trained nurse, ‘‘Miss Morphine’’.

Of course, you'll say that’s worse than drink;
It’s possible, too, you’re right,

At least it drives the things away

That come and peer in the night.

There’s a homestead down in an old Maine town,
With lilacs around the gate,

And the Northerners whisper, “‘It might have been”’,
But the truth has come too late.

They say they’ll give me one month to live—
A month or a year is the same;

I haven’t the heart to play my part

To the end of a losing game.

Kor whenever you play, whatever the way,
For the stakes that are large or small,

The claws of the tropics will gather your pile,
And the dealer gets it all.
