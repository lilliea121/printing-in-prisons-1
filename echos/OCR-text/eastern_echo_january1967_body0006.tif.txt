superiority on which Anglo-Saxon civilization is
based. It is nevertheless one of the most effective
smear and indoctrination devices developed since the
crusades. Of course “White” and “Caucasian” are
equally as barren of biological and scientific signifi-
eance. As such there are actually no “White People” ;
except the ‘albino’, who is a very pink or ghostly
white in color.

So my call to all who are prone to believe in the
‘old Myths’ of an archaic age, is to wake up and
recognize that this is a New Era of New Revelations
... New Religions... New Systems of Philos-
ophy which are turning the tide of Spiritual and
Social interests away from the orthodoxy of the past
ages. The ery of the orthoroxy has been, “Believe
and Ye shall be saved”; but the new ery is,“God Is
Dead”; “Seek Ye The Truth and The Truth Shall
Set You Free” and —By knowledge is man saved!

As a first entry in Echo history on a racial subject, Mr.
Payne is to be commended for assisting in the birth of
Echo Baby. Rather than seeing ‘‘the problem” as a
“Negro Problem” or a ‘‘White Problem’”’ (or as a Red
Problem or a Yellow Problem), this writer understands
racial problems to be ‘‘Human Problems.’’ Perhaps Mr.
Payne will accept this invitation, to expand his opinions
by being more definitive in the April Echo, on the ‘‘Cau-
casian Problem’’ as he sees it. Others wishing to com-
ment on this subject are invited to do so.—The Editor.

Surprise! Surprise! Surprise!
Maybe God is black

Only white in disguise

Was lus har kinky and curled
Or did he use dyes

But don’t be on edge!

We have a graven image!

The High Cost Of Living

by Harry Zietz

In 1953 the Bureau of Correction determined
that the correct amount an individual inmate should
be permitted to spend on Commissary items was four
dollars weekly. Today, fourteen years later, this same
four dollar limit exists, but the four dollars has a
purchase value of approximately two dollars and six-
ty cents! Generally, prices have risen about forty per
cent on Commissary items, while the four dollar week-
ly limit has not been considered for adjustment.

To illustrate the difference in prices over these
years the following comparison is submitted:

ITEM 1958 1966 DIFFERENCE
Cigarettes (Car.) $2.20 $2.80 Plus $ .60
Ice Cream 20 33 i .08

Cigar, Tobacco, ete. (Generally ) Z 04
Soap .08 ollZ} a 04
Toothpaste oe CAL 2 05
Mise. Toilet Articles (Generally) ee:

TOTAL: $.92

The above illustration covers only a few of our
Commissary items and there is already an increase of
of ninety-two cents! As a further illustration there
follows below a table showing a ‘‘normal’’ or ‘‘near

average’’ weekly order using items most popular and
necessary with the comparable prices:

ITEM 1958 1966 DIFFERENCE

1- Carton Cigarettes $2.20 $2.80 Plus $ .60

1 - Car. Matches 08 14 x 06
Candy (Assorted) AT soll gee 0s
Total: $4.00 $5.16 $1.16

As can be seen by this illustration this ‘‘normal’’
order of what we could purchase in 19538 for four
dollars would now cost $5.16, an increase of $1.16.
Therefore, we must eliminate from our 1966 order
$1.16 of the merchandise, leaving us $2.84 of the four
dollars the Bureau determined we could spend in
1953!

In addition to the above illustrations, during the
middle and late 1950’s we were permitted to purchase
all clothing items separate from the four dollar limit.
Now such items as socks, handkerchiefs, bath slippers,
