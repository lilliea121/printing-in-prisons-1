And look!

Henry Chadwick was the father of baseball,
Alexander Cartwright designed the first baseball
diamond—Two Old Cat was the first style of the
game. Cincinnati was the first pro club and the
first paid players. Candy Cummings was the first
curve ball pitcher, William Caldwell printed the
first article on baseball, the first umpire was J. A.
Cross, and the first player to be expelled from base-
ball was a shortstop named Craven. Henry Cote of
Grand Rapids in the Interstate League still holds the

record for the greatest number of games caught in
a scheduled season. Charley Comiskey was the first
baseman who created the style to play off the bag.
‘“Casey at the Bat’’ was the first poem on baseball,
and last but not least, Cooperstown, N. Y. is the
Shrine of baseball. :

Now Steve, suppose you had a team of Cochrane
and Nig Clarke as catchers, Clarkson, Cicotte,
Coombs, Camnitz and Stanley Coveleski as pitchers,
an infield comprising Hal Chase, Eddie Collins, Joe
Cronin and Jimmie Collins, and the outfield with Ty
Cobb, Sam Crawford and Fred Clarke patrolling
the gardens, with Dode Criss as a pinchhitter, for
why I don’t know, for the Lord knows this club
would never need a pinch-hitter.

Also relief pitchers Hugh Casey and Otis
Crandall.

Manager, who better than the peerless leader
Frank Chance, and the club to be captained by one
of the greatest field leaders that ever lived—Fred
Clarke.

And the umpire of course would be Tommy
Connoly.

So Steve you can go over the rest, and I wager
you could pick three teams that could lick the
Yankees every day in the week, for weeks and
weeks on End. I believe a lot of the boys would
have plenty of fun, also friendly arguments picking
favorites from this list herein, also trying to figure
a letter which would equal the caliber of players
equivalent to the letter C.

PEN-CELL LEAGUE

Joseph ‘‘Knock-Knock’’ Jowett, Commissioner

BIRD-DOGS, Louis “‘Scratch’’ Straccioni, Manager

This is the club to beat, or to be more realistic,
try to finish second to. Having remained un-
defeated through nine straight games, there is no
indication that the Bird-Dogs won’t maintain a
reasonably good standard of performance through-
out the season. Harry Fricker has nine home runs,
Jimmy Morrison, six, and Billy Hollowell, five.
Each can knock the wall down, or the ball over it on
any given afternoon. Front line pitching the best
in the league with an added surprise in Paul Neal
who has a 3-0 record to date. Neal is not as stingy
with base hits as Heinemann, but can be depended
upon to get the ball in there and let the opposition

hit it to the near perfect defense his team has shown
so far. The leading hitter, Billy Hollowell, has a
.600 average while leading pitcher, Bobby Heine-
mann, sports a 6-0 record.
Prospects: Will be the 1957 Champs.
RELIABLE A.C., John ‘‘Obie’’ O’Brien, Manager
Can Obie find first-flight pitching in Irish, Stew,
or Ski? As of this date the pitching for Relhable
has been un-reliable. How much will the loss of
Whalen’s. big bat be felt? Boots is the team stand-
out, at the catching spot he has plenty of hustle,
but can the team get along without secondary
catching? These are the questions that autumn will
answer. ‘Team lacks defense in spots and over-all
power in the batting order. Obie is the leading
hitter with a 400 average. Trish, the leading pitcher
with a 3-2 record may yet come up with a good
