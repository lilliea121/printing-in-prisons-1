Article IV

Since hope is a more potent agent than fear, it
should be made an ever present force in the minds of
prisoners, by a well-devised and skillfully-applied system
of rewards for good conduct, industry and attention to
learning. Rewards, more than punishments, are essential

to every good prison system.
