behind —

the idea

Tom had a problem. As he sat on a wooden bench
ni the exercise yard of Eastern Correctional Institu-
tion, he mulled it over again and again in his mind.
After serving the minimum of a 5 to 10 year sen-
tence for Burglary, he had applied for parole. It had
been granted,—on condition. The condition? That
he obtain a sound parole plan—job, home and spon-
sor—before he could be released.

But the release date had come and gone. For de-
spite all his efforts, Tom had failed to formulate the
necessary parole plan. His contacts exhausted, he
needed a minor miracle. He was a typical “‘hold-
over.

But Tom did have a friend. Another inmate. And
his friend, Steve, chanced upon a four-page pamph-
let written by Joe Paull, entitled, “Let's Do Some-
thing About Holdovers.”’

It was not the first time either inmate had heard of
Mr. Paull. Both had, in fact, “‘seen him around the
institution.” But here was more than the figure of
the man, more than his tremendous word-of-mouth
reputation. Here was the man’s own statement of

his living concern.

As Tom eagerly scanned the pamphlet, he real-
ized a new hope had come into his life. Here was
another chance to formulate that vital parole plan.

That pamphlet which Tom read and based his
hope upon, reads in part:

“What is the cost of a mistake? or several mis-
takes? How long does one continue to pay the
price? A lifetime—perhaps? Those individuals eli-
gible for release from penal institutions quickly learn
the answer when they try to formulate a parole plan.

Eastern Echo

“Society is not quick to forgive and forget, un-
fortunately. This is the bitter lesson the pre-release
inmates are forced to review over and over when
seeking to complete a parole plan. They seek re-
demption—but all avenues are closed to them.
Home and sponsorship are denied them, just as is
gainful employment. Thus, they become a statistic
—a ‘holdover.’

“There is nothing novel about the ideas | shall ex-
press about two phases of parole work which I re-
gard as very important. No doubt my opinions have
been discussed many times before. Yet, from my
point of view, and those of penal adminsitrators,
these two responsibilities cannot be overemphasized.

“One is the reduction of ‘holdover’ cases or more
precisely, the releasing of eligible inmates on dates
set for their release.

‘The other is the importance of getting public co-
operation to solve the ‘holdover’ problem.”

Concerning the importance of Job Security, Mr.
Paull had this to say:

“It is my belief that the strategic point at which
corrective influence can be mobilized to reverse the
direction of a man’s life, to sever his connections
with antisocial groups and restore him to society is
the point at which an inmate leaves prison and takes
his first job. If he flounders around in a shifting labor
field—-with intervals of nonemployment in between
—he cannot so easily resist the ‘easy money’ of the
street corner. On the other hand, if he has a job
which assures him of a steady income and which af-
fords him the recognition that all of us need, respect
and trust, he will develop into the type of individual
