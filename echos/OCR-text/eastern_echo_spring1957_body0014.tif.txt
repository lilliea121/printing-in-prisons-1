In Steo With The Times

PROGRESSIVE
PAROLE

by Andre L. Paschedag

In modern times, particularly under the present
administration, giant strides have been taken in the
direction of ‘‘progressive penology.’’ The many
administrators, psychologists, social workers, cus-
todial personnel, and other adherents of progressive
penology have slowly but inexorably overcome the
dread inertia of the falsely sanctified ‘‘status quo,’’
and this enlightened system of penology is starting
to grow and bear fruit. Fruit in the shape of human
beings, not made snow-white pure or blameless over-
night by some mystical process, but human beings
who have paid a just debt, and who, in the process,
have obtained a new set of values which should
enable them to rejoin society without harm to them-
selves or their neighbors.

I say ‘‘should’’ instead of ‘‘will’ because most
men released from a penal institution must face two
more obstacles to successful rehabilitation after the
penologist has completed his work. The first ob-
stacle is the largely personal problem of peacefully
finding employment, pleasure, security, and the other
accoutrements of civilization, while bearing the
onerous classification of ‘‘ex-con.’’ The second is
the largely public problem of adaptation to the
regulations of a still greatly unprogressive system
of parole. Failure to successfully overcome either
of these problems creates a recidivist, just as failure
to provide proper post-operative treatment creates
an unwell patient or a corpse.

Since the first problem is largely personal, the
public can do very little to help and discussion would
serve no purpose, but the problem of ‘‘unprogressive
parole’’ belongs to society and should be discussed
and acted upon as a public problem. In the hope
that this article may serve as a catalyst for local dis-
cussion, I should like to present the following points
as food for thought upon the subject:

1. The Parole Board should be composed of
12

members qualified for their positions by formal
training and experience in penology, human rela-
tions, psychology, or other related social sciences.
They should be protected by civil service and free
from the whims and pressures of the patronage or
‘““spoils’’ system of any state government so in-
clined. Members should always be politically in-
nocent so that their actions may not be construed to
reflect the influence of any political power behind
the scenes. Only under such conditions could they
act impartially on the true merits of a case and
safely ignore the pleas or threats of those having
a personal ‘‘axe to grind.’’

In addition to the regular members of the Parole
Board, the Warden or Superintendent of the insti-
tution concerned should have a seat on the board
when an applicant from his institution is being
heard. He should be committed to vote as directed
by the ‘‘Staff Board’’ of the institution, since they
have previously and thoroughly evaluated the ap-
plicant’s record. Only in this manner can the
opinions of those most qualified to appraise the ap-
plicant’s rehabilitation be assured their proper
weight.

The entire Parole Board should be present at
the time applicants for parole are interviewed rather
than a sub-committee of one or two members. The
present system places too much weight upon the
decision of one or two members, while the other
members are personally unacquainted with the case
outside of the sometimes easily misinterpreted
records they have available. Since the decision to
erant or refuse parole is made by the board in its
entirety, it follows that all board members should
hear the applicant. A comparable analogy to the
present system would be a trial in which one-half of
the jury hears the case and reports their version to
the other half before bringing in a verdict.

The Parole Board should not regard itself as
a judiciary instrument, but rather as a Board of
Evaluation, determining the measure of rehabilita-
tion. It is the trial judge’s duty to consider such
factors as the seriousness of the man’s crime, his
previous convictions, his former parole status, and
other sentences pending before passing his sentence.
When the Parole Board bases its action upon any
such factors, it is forgetting its proper function
and is acting as a re-sentencing agency. There-
fore, the Parole Board should base its decision on
such valid factors as the inmate’s conduct, status
of rehabilitation, moral values, previous parole vio-
lations in the case of re-parole, and staff reeommen-
dations, leaving to the judge and jury the power
of determining guilt and proclaiming sentence.

2. Parole regulations should be realistically
interpreted by those concerned, rather than upheld
as an ideal set of commandments which may not be
broken without retribution. Some technical vio-
