THE
WEDDING
GIFT

by HAROLD GEORGE SHADD

Joe Nassar eased his tall, lanky frame forward
on the chrome and leather chair .. pushed the micro-
phone a little closer to the automatic turn-table.
Carefully he placed four long-playing records on the
shiny steel spindle sticking up out of the round, green
dise. He readjusted his shell-rimmed glasses ... .
scratched his well-formed nose... glanced at the
elock. 2:27 A.M. Three more minutes to go, then
he’d have an hour to himself—an hour in which to
give his wife, Ethyl, her present.

Joe and Ethyl had been married ten years ago to-

were going to be unmarried. Joe would be free...
and Ethyl ... would be dead.

Joe raised his curly black head from preoccupa-

bright warning. 2:29 A.M. One more minute.

He had gone over the whole thing carefully. If
everything went as smoothly as he had it figured,
he’d be able to murder Ethyl and not fall under
suspicion. He’d have the best alibi in the world.
His own voice. And... thousands of listeners.

2:30 A.M.

Joe flipped the switches and his deep, masculine
voice glided out over the air-waves, creeping into
the radios of cars speeding along the dark, almost
deserted highways; gliding into the home sets of the
late stay-er-uppers. His alibi. His listeners.

‘‘Good morning, people,’’ his tape-recorded voice
said. ‘‘This is Joe Nassar, your wee hour dis¢ jockey
... the old night owl .. . bringing you music to sleep
by ... or musie to wake up by, whichever your case
might be. For our first platter thig morning, we’ll
