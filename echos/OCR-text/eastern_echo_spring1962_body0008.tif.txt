Lee Arthur Vester, 14, a Negro, recently began
serving a o0-year term for murder, and in 1960,
Edward Vargas, 16, entered prison for a minimum
40 years for murder, in Illinois.

Today, in Indiana, a 9-year-old boy—Ronald Wing
—is in custody of juvenile authorities while pro-
cedures are being studied. He was held on a prelim-
inary charge of first-degree murder after the slaying
Ol a Snel, IB,

In Illinois, Stephen Schlonger, 138, has been
charged with murder in the death of a T-year-old
neighbor girl.

In New York, a Puerto Rican now 18, has but one
hope left: that Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller will com-
mute his death sentence, taking into account that
Agron was only a day past 16 when he killed two
boys.

The capacity to inflict death upon youngsters drew
a sharp condemnation at a recent Univesity of Chi-
cago conference of “Justice for the Child.” More
than 70 of the nation’s leading juvenile jurists, at-
torneys, probation officers, educators, welfare and
social workers at a seminar expressed outrage “that
any state retains and uses the power to execute a
minor. Justice for the child means exactly that, and
there can be no justice in executing a child, any
child, anywhere,” they said.

The juvenile court is not a court in the usual sense.
Basically, it is a place where a hearing is conducted
to decide what action can be taken in a case involv-
ing a juvenile.

The court’s fundamental aim was stated in the laws
by which Illinois created the first juvenile court in
1899. It is “that the care, custody and discipline of
a child (found to be delinquent, dependent or ne-
glected) shall approximate as nearly as may be that
which would be given by its parents.”

“The truly significant innovations of the Illinois
act was that children charged with law violations
were not being treated as criminals but were to be ac-
corded the same individual assistance as dependent
and neglected children,” says Judge Orman Ketcham
of the Washington, D.C. Juvenile Court.

“Tt marked an important departure from previous
English and American chancery proceedings which
had provided protection only to those children whose
distress was the result of their own delinquent acts.”

There is no uniformity to the age limits which
would bring a person under jurisdiction of the ju-
venile court, or bar him.

New York’s Children’s Court is limited to those
15 and younger, while California and Nevada juris-

diction technically extends to those 20 and younger.
In states such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Kentucky, Maine, Texas and Massachusetts, juris-
diction covers those 16 and under, and in Alabama,
Arizona, Hawaii, Idaho, Maryland, Virginia, Minne-
sota, New Hampshire and New Jersey, 17 and under.

These ages are varying definitions of children ju-
venile and minor. The board standard came from
common law.

Under the common law yardstick, children of 7
were deemed absolutely innocent, that is, lacking the
mental competence required for criminal liability.

Children between 7 and 14 were presumed to lack
such capacity. But this could be overcome by show-
ing that the child was sufficiently intelligent to
understand what he had done. At 14, a child was
presumed to have adult intelligence and stand liable
for his actions.

The common law groupings, which largely set age
standards for criminal capacity do not coincide with
statutes setting juvenile court jurisdictions. The re-
sults are that while a state may consider a 15-year-
old as a child, it may also be able to hold a 10-year-
old responsible for certain crimes.

The manner in which this is done is typified in the
Schlonger case. On October 4, the body of Yvenne
Elliot, 7, was found in Elmhurst, a suburb of Chicago.
She had been raped and slain. The Schlonger boy
confessed.

Ordinarily, because he was 13 he would come under
the jurisdiction of the Family Court, as the juvenile
court is called in Illinois. But the law provides that
the state’s attorney can bring any child from the age
of 10 before a grand jury on a homicide investigation
if he can show the child knew right from wrong and
was aware of his act.

Because of the difference in laws and their inter-
pretations, there is a hodgepodge of legal possibilities
that apparently contradict each state’s law concern-
ing juvenile court jurisdiction.

In New York, a 15-year-old charged with a serious
crime can be transferred to jurisdiction of the crim-
inal court. In Iowa, the juvenile court has no juris-
diction in any case in which the punishment for an
adult could be life in prison or the death penalty.
Indiana’s juvenile courts can waive any capital case
—without regard to age—to criminal jurisdiction.

Texas’ juvenile court has jurisdiction of those
16 and under, but it is possible to keep a 10-year-old
in custody until he is 17 and then try him for murder
committed at 10, although the death penalty could
not be invoked then.
