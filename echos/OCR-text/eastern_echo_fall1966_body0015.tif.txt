Bindery Department — The main function of this depart-
ment are folding, gluing and various forms of binding.
Folders include from the simplest Four-page Folder to
the Sixteen-page Folder. There are two methods of wire
stitching: saddle and side stitch. The more permanént
bindings are Edition Binding (hard cover), Perfect Bind-
ing (pocket books & telephone directory), and Mechan-
ical Binding (wire, strip metal, plastic or loose leaf).
With the increased use of snap-set forms for official use,
new semi-automatic gluing machines have been installed.

workers.

Shipping Department — Shipping is the final operation
of all printing orders. Invoicing, packaging, mailing and
transportation are a few of the various jobs included in
this department. It also operates as the receiving de-
partment for items and equipment purchased by the
printing plant. At the present time, this area is being en-
larged to facilitate its operations due to increased busi-
ness. Personnel in photograph are (from left to right)
