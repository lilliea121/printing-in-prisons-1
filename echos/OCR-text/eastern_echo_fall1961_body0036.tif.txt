Eastern League vs. The Outside
by
Bob Gullen

The Hastern All-Stars got the summer season off to
a good start by defeating a group of high school stars
under the sponsorship of Dom’s Bar. The insiders
played it elose to the vest in the first half and were
nursing a one point lead when the whistle sounded
ending the period. A change of strategy was dictated
by coach Thompson when play resumed, and the sec-
ond half saw the Easternites break the game wide
open, going into a sixteen point margin midway
through the half. The seeret weapon was a fast break
that had a big man flying down court instead of the
usual little fellow. The teenagers whittled away at
the lead during the closing moments but couldn't
quite make it as the game ended with the home team
on the front end of a 75-67 score.

For the visitors there were four men in double fig-
ures with John Hrickson, team captain, high man as
he tallied nineteen points. Tim Short contributed
thirteen markers while his brother Mike cut the cords
for eleven and Jack Foley had a total of ten. Bill
Lodge flipped in four field goals for eight points, Ed
Erickson added four points to the teams efforts and
Fred Corkery came through with a single that gave
him two points.

The home team five also had four men in double
figures as Alvin “Shakey” Young led the way with
twenty-one points. The Big “D,”’ Donnie Wise, had
seventeen markers, with eleven of them coming in the
first eight minutes. Billy Holley had eleven tallies
and Elijah Sheperd hit the hoop for ten. Under the
boards, Jake Welty kept it rolling wih six points and
Cochise Bell had two field goals for four. Al Sheperd
sank a long jump shot for two points and Little Ray
contributed a pair of lay-ups to run out the game.
Play-maker for the All-Stars was John O’Brien who
did not score, as was the ease of his alternate, Juice
Cohen, who also failed to tally. John Wheeler came
off the bench several times as a defensive measure
and put out the fire.

The play of these kids from the strect, gives an
indication of the wealth of basketball talent that is
present in the city of Philadelphia. Conspicuously
evident was the amount of poise they have developed
in so few years. The two coaches of the team have
reason to be proud of their efforts.

COLLEGE ALL-STARS TAKE EASTERN

One of Kasterns biggest basketball days was nearly
ruined as thunder squalls hit their area. Five of the
city’s and nation’s best players were on hand to give
the Eastern League All-Stars their first big test of
the season. Heading the list was Hal “King” Lear,
former All-American at Temple, and now one of the
top prospects in the newly formed American Basket-
ball League. In the backcourt with Hal was Herb
Janey, a popular figure on the Philadelphia area
courts and a member of several city championship
teams. At center was Russ Gordon, star of the pres-
ent Temple University team that has defeated the
best teams in the country. Under the boards, Jay
Norman showed the spirit that carned him a starting
berth on the great Temple teams that were in the
semi-finals of the N.C.A.A. tournaments and just
missed winning the national crown. Handling the
boards with Jay was Richie Washington, one of the
stars of the Spike’s Trophies team that captured the
Kastern Pennsylvania A. A. U. Title in the 1960-61
season. Richie is also a member of Spike’s American
Legion Team that won the title in its league the same
year.

The College five started off with gusto as Lear
popped the net with three consecutive twenty-five
footers that had the crowd on their feet. Hastern re-
taliated with a fast break and held their own for the
first half. Billy Holley led the home-towners with a
trio of driving layups while O’Bie and Shakey were
connecting from the outside. Under the boards, Jay
Norman knotted the count as he stuffed the roundball
through the hoop and, on the next play, tapped the
ball to Herb Janey who pushed in a pair of corner
shots. When the Easterners concentrated on Norman,
Lear took over again and ended up with fifteen points
in the first quarter. The fast paced action saw the
lead change hands several times before the period
ended with the outsiders leading 29-25. Adopting
new tactics the college five went into the old postman
offense, and shattered the Eastern defensive midway
in the second quarter. Until this pomt Coach Thomp-
son’s Five had amazed the crowd with the poise that
they displayed in handling the college stars. Un-
fortunately, Mother Nature was agin’ the home team
and thwarted their efforts to get back in the game hy
‘alling down the heavens in one great cloudburst of
rain. The College Five did promise to come back in
the near future and that return match is cagerly
anticipated by our team and spectators.
