EARL BROWN AND THE LITTLE GUY

‘A lot of people,” says Earl Brown, “say it’s the
little things in life that really count. Could be
they’re right. Is there anyone happier than the
small boy who owns a wide-brimmed hat and two
toy guns?”

THIS I BELIEVE, by EARL BROGAN

Perhaps some day, people will come to realize
the power of love and understanding, and through
the realization, will find themselves armed with the
necessary weapons to conquer fear, frustration, neu-

rosis and all of those things which are definite fac-
tors in the causation of criminal behavior. Then
and then only, will the world become a better place
to live in, and hostilities between men will no longer
be harbored in the hearts of man.

SNOOPY SALUTES

We are proud to salute MR. JOHN V. KRATZ,
of W.T. Peck and Company, Phila. Pa. Here is the
story.

TOM FLANNERY, linotype operator, was
geranted a parole, unfortunately Tom had no job or
sponsor (parole plan) and had no one to turn to
for help. In desperation Tom wrote letter after
letter to prospective employers in the printing
trades. In a few days a reply was received from
Mr. Kratz. Mr. Kratz understood Tom’s problem
and although he, himself could not help, took the
liberty of forwarding Tom’s letter to a friend. Sure
enough the call for help was answered. Today Tom
Flannery is on the road to success. We have others
with a problem such as Tom had. We refer you to
the article “EMPLOYER NEEDED” by FRANK
TERRES, in this issue of the ECHO.

VAN GOGH vs ONE EAR

Padded down seven block the other day, and
was startled to see JOE BARANOWSKI standing
in front of a mirror with razor blade in hand con-
templating his ears. Developed that Baranowski
had read where Van Gogh had cut off one ear. Our
boy Joe figures, that if it would make him a better
artist, he’d be willing to cut off both ears, and may-
be a few toes to boot. Seriously though, J.B. has
made such excellent progress, that he has been asked
to submit a canvas for the Spring Art Exhibit at a
downtown gallery.

EXODUS IN ALL DIRECTIONS

This pup was down the kitchen the other day,
lapping up a saucer of java, and listening to the
philosophy of SAM “COFFEE” BALDWIN, when
he was almost trampled underfoot by a mad exo-
dus of coffee dunkers dispersing toward the neck.
Found out later, that MAJOR STOWELL, had pull-
ed a Pearl Harbor on the local chapter of Don
MeNeil’s breakfast club—by slipping in the back
way.

WHO'S A NEEDLE?

Is it true, that during a recent operation in the
hospital, one of the interns mistook WILLIE “THIN

EASTERN ECHO

MAN” SUTTON for a needle, and had eight stitches
in the patient before he found out his mistake?

HAIRCUT, SHAVE, SHAMPOO, ANYONE?

Sticking his whiskers out, Snoopy predicts that
“BLACKY” BATTLES, will be the officers’ barber
when HARRY CHAPASCO, makes it out. The kid
has the knack, and under the tutelage of the old
master “SABU”, should come into his own as a
shearing artist. Wonder what he’d charge for a
poodle cut?

HORSELESS SHOE CLUB

On the horse shoe court, back of nine block,
RONNIE BUNTS and “HOUND DOG” MILLER,
trying to dominate the court. EDDIE BROOKS
vows to unseat them, if JOHN ZAK will stop throw-
ing the shoes as though the horses were still wear-
ing them. That can’t be though, judging by the
way — PUNKGY AN DIES.) Vn = an wivee 2
WINTERS and FLIP FLEMING scoff up the chow,
the nag would have been hamburger long ago. Those
boy’s need their energy, what with JOHN DILITKA,
RUSS SHANK and JOHN STRANAHAN pitching
the shoes like demons, and BOB “HUTCH” HUTCH-
INSON and “JERSEY” LAWLER coming on
strong, the title of King Pitch, is up for grabs.
