The ex-con doeswt get the chotce job.

great a hardship to overcome and resort to crime on
his release? All too often, this is exactly what hap-
pens. The prisoner is released with literally none of
his problems resolved, and in fact, many of his origi-
nal problems aggravated by his inability to earn suf-
ficient funds while he is in prison.

Employment after release in many cases, is just
‘another chapter in the never ending nightmare of the
convicted offender. Apathetic or downright antag-
onistic employers can make life miserable for a be-
wildered ex-inmate trying to readjust to a world that
passed him by while he was serving his sentence. It
is a fact that the ex-con doesn’t get the choice job. |
don’t argue the merit, I merely state it as a fact. He
is usually last hired and first fired if the economy
takes the slightest dip. The average offender (if
there is such a person) is at best, a semi-skilled work-
er and more likely a laborer. The very type of worker
that is easiest to replace.

To be fair, there are some responsible employers
who literally bend over backwards to help ex-
offenders to readjust. We are aware of the fact that
some humanitarian employers have had their trust

betrayed by the very ex-offenders who they had tried
to help.

I ask the following question here: What is the best
method of teaching good work habits—Is it done
through a system of rewards for good work?

Men who spend their time in menial, nonproduc-
tive jobs in prison lose sight of this ‘reward for good
work’ system. It is not reasonable to expect overnight
changes in these same men, who for years have had
the productive impulse stifled. Self-respect and dig-
nity, like a cloak, should not be removed and re-
placed at will. There is considerable evidence, that
in this culture a man’s self-respect, therefore much of
his social orientation depends on his “‘right to work.”’

Gainful employment and creative, responsible ac-
tivity, enables the individual to establish his individu-
ality and social usefulness. Deprived of work, he
often loses “relatedness” to life and the ability (or
desire) to be productive.

In prison, however, this “‘right to work’’ is too
often ignored. Immigrants living in the slum areas
illustrate the effects of unemployment among the
male members of the family. Because of the numer-
ous opportunities of the women to obtain employ-
ment, the roles of the family change, with husband
and wife situations reversed. This invariably results
in the loss of prestige and self-respect of the father

(or male), who sometimes turn to crime as a means
of regaining status.

If work, that is, satisfying, gainful employment,
does indeed play the important role in a man’s life,
that knowledge and experience leads us to believe
then we had better do something about our lack of
responsible, gainful employment in our prisons. A
good example of the lack of motivated work in pris-
ons, is in one institution which has more than half of
its population on menial maintenance work, such as
sweeping, washing dishes and yard policing. Neces-
sary work? To be sure. But hardly motivating and
in many cases, monotonous and depressing, with a
retraining value of zero. Most men are interested in
their work because of the standard of living it pro-
vides. To a lesser degree they are interested in the
amount of personal satisfaction they gain from their
work. The average worker's interest in his job tends
to vary with the degree of status and the pay level.
The lower the worker's status, the less interested he
is likely to be in his job.

CASE HISTORY
On the job in Raleigh, North Carolina, Jessie Ennis

looks like any other service station attendant. He
pumps gas, checks oil, cleans windshields. His blue
denim uniform and western style black boots, hide
the fact that he is a convict serving three to five years
for breaking and entering.

Ennis is one of more than fourteen hundred pris-
oners enrolled in North Carolina’s ““Work Release
Program’’ which was launched two years ago. He
holds and outside job during working hours and
spends his off duty time in confinement. His earnings
of fifty dollars a week pay his way through prison,
support his wife and three young children, and pro-
vide him with a nest egg for use when he is released.

Jessie Ennis, age twenty-two, dropped out of high
school in the tenth grade, married early, began a
family and ran into financial trouble. That makes
him a typical beneficiary of the “Work Release
Program.”

“Since I’ve been here I’ve gotten a different out-
look on things,” he says of his job. ““They don't treat
you like a convict. They don’t hold it over you. It’s
like | had come off the streets and gotten a job.”

His employer, Emmet Bagwell, has hired several
prisoners and plans to keep Ennis after he is paroled.

“Work Release’ has smoothed the way for the
transition from custody to parole for Ennis, it has also
