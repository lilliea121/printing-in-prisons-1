“Qhe Stones Will Crp Out”

Bp Rev. Edwin L. Gallagher, Catholic Chaplain

Each year the Catholic Church
celebrates the Feast of the Holy
Hantiive = Vou shouldn a be 100
much surprised to find the word
-“‘holy’’ linked with the word
.“‘family’’. Everyone wants a
‘happy household. A family may,
-indeed, be boisterous, playful, but
S it won’t be peacefully, truly happy
unless it is holy.

You have of course heard of
the ‘‘un-holy’’ family, the one that

begins in sin, continues in self-made rules of conduct
and frequently ends in divorce—leaving broken
homes, twisted lives and problem children. Were
you raised in such an atmosphere? If you weren’t,
if your parents were faithful to their marriage vows,
then demonstrate your appreciation by a wholesome
way of life. If unfortunately your childhood was
spent in an ‘‘un-holy’’ family, then the least you can
do is to make sure that your children will never suf-
fer as you did.

In observing the Holy Family, you’ll notice that
it was a child-centered family. Note also that its
members did not live in some dream world. They
lived at Nazareth—in an atmosphere so devoid of
culture and refinement and virtue that later one of

Mh,

the future apostles (Nathaniel) dismissed Our Lord
with the terse comment: ‘‘Can anything good
come out of Nazareth?’’ It’s not the neighborhood
that’s important, it’s the grace of God inside the
four walls that counts.

It is comforting to discover that the Holy

Family was dependent on the labor of Joseph’s

hands to earn its daily bread. Joseph didn’t waste
time and cause heartaches by trying to find short-
cuts to a soft lving. No, he worked to survive.
This they did—in bread and in virtue.

Note the three virtues required for a holy
family life—love, respect and obedience. These
make for unity; and where there is unity, there
can be no selfishness. Where we find a family
practicing these virtues, we find a happy family,
even though many material things may be wanting.
The ultimate foundation of a family’s happiness is
not necessarily to be measured by a giant color T.V.
set. You have met people with bulging pocket-
books and hungry hearts—and pitied them. They
stand sadly in want of a little love and respect and
obedience.

Consider the Holy Family of Nazareth and see
in it your ideal in clear outline. Then it remains for
you to pray for the grace to produce that radiant
ideal in your own family living when you get out.

Bp Reb. Anthony F. Wasques, Baptist Chaplain

Are you planted? Believe it
or not, you are.

I recall as a youngster in a
grade school, our teacher reading
to us a poem. A poem which, in
part, I stillremember. It told the
story of a little boy whose parents
found him one day, standing
NES quietly and seriously in the
==, = garden. In one chubby hand he

W. held a tall sunflower, which he
poy antes 2084) had pulled out of the ground,
roots and all. His feet were buried in the soft
earth where previously the sunflower had been grow-
ing. The poem concluded with these words:

“We asked our darling what pleased him.
He replied with face aglow:

‘Mother, I am going to be a man,

I have planted myself to grow.’ ”’

In his childish mind he had put two and two

together—and it had added up to ‘‘growth’’. If
the sunflower could grow—so could he.

And so, do we all. For whether it be for good
or for evil—we are all planted. And that which
we become is largely determined by that which
nurtures us.

On one occasion Jesus the Christ said: ‘‘I am
the true vine, ye are the branches.’’ And it was
not surprising that those who were nurtured by
Him as His branches, when the testing time came to
show the courage of their convictions—that even
their enemies could see ‘‘that they had been with
Jesus’’. It was that noticeable!

This is one of life’s irrefutable lessons that we
become like those we admire and listen to. We
become like those we look up to and follow. Do
not “‘kid’’ yourself, you are planted either to grow
into a fruitful plant or a parasitic weed. If you
want the BEST, listen to and follow the ONE who
said: ‘“‘I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.”’

How about cultivating your growth?
