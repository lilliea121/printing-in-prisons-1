more brutality and more innocent victims of crim-
inals now driven by revenge as well as whatever mo-
tive originally made them turn to crime.

The progressive methods sponsored by psychi-
atrists and sociologists are under indictment as fatl-
ures by many citizens. However, as seen by a sub-
ject of such treatment, their failure lies not in the
method, but in the lack of cooperation beyond the
bounds of the local authority of the psychiatrists and
sociologists coneerned. Their work within prisons
‘an only produce healthy results and_ statistics
through the cooperation of other authorities and the
public at large. Therapy within a prison can only
ignite within the prisoner a desire to reform, it can-
not answer for the cancellation of this spark by the
antagonistic attitudes of others.

Office meetings between felons and the repre-
sentives of free society should not be regarded as a
place where peace treaties are signed, or a surrender-
ing of the rights of society, but as an opportunity to
reach the man who lives at the core of every criminal.
Perhaps with proper follow-through such mectings
would lessen greatly the chance of more dangerous
meetings in dark alleyways.

A different type of letter was written by G.
Richard Bacon of the Pennsylvania Prison Society,
and brought forth an editorial response from the
newspaper concerned. We quote:

“Your editorial ‘Contrast in Pardons’
touches a controversial subject of great importance
to our state. .,. . However, it seems particularly im-
portant that any discussion should be based on accur-
ate statements of fact.

“Your statement that ‘during the Leader Admin-
istration the occasion was rare, indeed, when a peti-
tion for commutation of a murderer’s life sentence
was turned down’ is in striking contrast with pub-
lished figures. For the year 1958, commutation of
life sentence to make applicant eligible for release

was granted in 29 cases or 23% of a total of 126 cases.

“Your statement that a life term up to this year
in Pennsylvania ‘was something like 16 years’ is
questioned in the heht of the official figure of 18.5
years. =

In answering this charge of inaccurate report-
ing, the Editor stated, “The overstatement does not
nullify the theme, that pardons used to be much more
readily obtainable.”

Such a reply is a graphic demonstration of an
attitude which often leads to a sometimes frightening
distortion of facts, and a subsequent completely false
impression upon the unsuspecting reader. “The over-
statement does not nullify the theme!” Using such
a philosophy as a basis for our reasoning it would be
perfectly proper for us to say, “All editors are irre-
sponsible.” In defending this position we could then
deny that the obvious overstatement nullifies the
theme that some editors are irresponsible.

Speaking of newspapers, the comic¢ pages prob-
ably have more popular appeal than any other feat-
ure. For this reason we were pleased to find that
Messrs. Dallis and Heilman, creators of the “Judge
Parker” comic strip, have taken up the question of
the complex relationship between the parolee and the
community.

From past reading we have found that the
“Judge Parker’ sirip can be depended upon, not
merely for amusement, but also information and en-
lightenment concerning many of the social problems
of the day. Perhaps their efforts will in this instance
affect the thinking of many readers unreached by
other channels of communication. We must admit to
our personal curiosity as to what the future holds in
store for their latest protagonist, the parolee. What-
ever the resolution, we wish to compliment Mr. Dallis
and Mr. Heilman for their efforts in this area.

Upon this note, the defense rests its case, keep-
ing an eye upon the prosecution until our next issue.

From the Superintendent's Desk:

Continued From Page 3

A Parole Commission created in 1925 studied the
situation and testimony then revealed that parole
had then become no more than a “paper parole.”
Recommendations bore fruit in 1929 and in 1939 and
culminated with the Parole Act of August 6, 1941,
IP.ILi, SOL,

It will be seen, therefore, that there was a pleth-
ora of laws and perhaps there will always be, depend-
ing on many factors. No doubt, much thinking and
debate prompted all this legislation so perhaps it
would be well to adapt what we have by application
of modern thinking, and advances in judicial fields
(including pre-sentence reports), probation, exeel-
lent penal programs and parole. Penal programs
have advanced tremendously in the Commonwealth
as has parole. It is hoped there will be unanimity in
all fields toward a common goal. Many Judges now
feel that long sentences are no longer necessary as
the prisons can recommend and parole authorities
can defer parole until the offender has proved he is

ready for return to society. There is an optimum
time when a prisoner should be released. This is
possible with the Ludlow Act where the minimum
term cannot be more than half the maximum term
—it can be less—it should be less to enable modern

circumvented by multiple consecutive sentences -
which destroys all hope and makes the offender think
“What’s the use of participating in many programs
of rehabilitation if it is hopeless in the beginning?”

Advaneed thinking in this total overall modern
concept is reflected in the fact that if a parolee suc-
cessfully adjusts on parole for five years or longer
the Parole Board recommends commutation of maxi-
mum sentence to the Pardon Board. For parolees
with life sentences it is ten years or more of good ad-
justment while on parole. Thus, “Are long sentences
necessary?” Why not extend hope by shorter mini-
mum sentences?

If violation of parole, as figures show, decreases
sharply after the third, fourth or fifth year, it is not
unreasonable to assume that imprisonment too ac-
complishes the same after a reasonable time.
