HAWKS DEFEAT DONS, 61-57,TO
INITIATE SECOND-HALF OF HASTERN BASKETBALL

LEAGUE

Noy. 7—-The Dons and Hawks played the opening game, and
the Hawks won by a four-point margin. Before game-time the
Dons were heavily favored. This was due to the fact that Elijah
Sheppard and his Gentlemen had won the first half by a wide
18-3 margin, and that Harry Fricker and his Hawks had finished
10-11, a poor third.

In spite of the Dons razzle-dazzle ball handling, and busy
scoring trio—Woody (12), E. Sheppard (12), C. Adderly (14),
steady rebounding and play-making by June-Bug (6), Bernard
(0), fair support from the bench, C. C. Clark (8), Vernon (4),
McCloud (1), Juice Cohens (0)—the fighting Hawks took the
lead in the first minute of the final quarter and rolled on to a
61-57 victory, shattering the Dons’ 8-game winning streak.

The dominant factors among the winning heros were
Fricker’g superb all-round playing which netted (16); Roose-
velt’s bull-like defensive and tricky offensive moves (16) ;Bo-
gardus with his steady-eddie motion, and always good for the
tap, sunk (13); Freddie, small but determined (14); Pinky’s
aggressiveness on the backboards (2); J. Robinson, E. Brown,

THE LAST-PLACE CELTICS
SCORED THEIR FIRST WIN OF 2ND HALF

Nov. 9—The determined Celtics trailed the Reliables by 9 points
at the end of the 1st quarter and didn’t begin until the last 7
minutes of the 2nd quarter to pick up momentum. In the re-
maining 8 minutes of the quarter they overwhelmed the first-
place Reliables and made it a tied game. The Reliables and
Celtics scored point-for-point in the third period. In the first
minute of the final quarter the Celtics took the lead and surged
on to a 49-40 victory, pushing the Reliables out of a three-way
first place tie with the Hawks and Dons.

Cochise, one of the league’s tallest, was the deciding factor
with 17 points, and the biggest margin of rebounds.

Croxton, coming alive with a bang in the final quarter
with 8 points and his share of rebounds, could have won the vote
of the game’s hero. Fleming (7), Little Mace (7), Blackie (3),
Swanson (3), Turk (2), Trypus (7), all figured as Celtics
gained its first decision in the half.

RELIABLES VICTOR WITH EARLY LEAD
Noy. 13—After two straight losses to third and fourth place
teams, John O’Brien and his Reliables were thrust back into
prominence by defeating the first-place Dons, by 56-53. Tucker
proved to be the difference with his 27 points. O’Brien and
Curly played a whale of a game; respectively, they scored 13,
10, each. A. A. Joe (4), Wheeler (2), figured in the win for the
Reliables.
SUMMARY OF THE LEAGUE’S FINAL HALF

Nothing could stop the schedule, and nothing could stop
true lovers of the game called Basketball. They were there,
cold, rain or shine. Harry Fricker, star player, ground-keeper,
reporter and part-time score-keeper, wins Yours Truly’s vote
for the valuable member of the league. Much credit goes to
Thomas (“Big Low’’) Davis and Ralph (‘The Tank’’) Burrell,
for the holding together of the league, for helping with keeping
the grounds in shape, and refereeing the games respectively.
GAMES IN BRIEF: The second half had many exciting
moments, but some of the most exciting were whenever the Dons
and Reliables met. A particular game in mind between the two
was their second meeting of the new half, in which required an
extra period to settle a win for the Reliables, 70-68. Curly, for
the Reliables and E. Sheppard, his opponent, put on a whale of a
duel in rebounding and shooting. Shep was good for 29 points,
and Curly, 26. The Reliables coupled Curly’s good day with the
excellent defensive work of Brooks (6), MeFall (2), Robert
Erwin (4), and the sharp-shooting of O’Brien, A. A. Joe and
John Wheeler, who collectively hit for a total of 30 points.

As the Dons went down to the Reliables, the next day the
Hawks spread their wings before them and served notice that
they were out for the Championship. They battled the Reliables
down to the wire before bowing, 50-44. Big Jim pumped in 17
points; Fricker (6) and Roosevelt (12) before Curly, Tucker,
and Shakey pulled the game away with a 37-point combined
effort. The loss didn’t damper the Hawks’ spirit at all, for they
came back with a 59-54 victory over the Celtics. In this game
Big Jim drove, tipped and shot his way to 19 points, while
Fricker and Earl Brown drove the opposition mad with their
tricky ball handling, stealing to set up play and offsetting the
