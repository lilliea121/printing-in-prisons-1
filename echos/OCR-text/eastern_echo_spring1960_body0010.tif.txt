and Commutation

Heavily embossed within the pages of many dic-
tionaries is the word “COMMUTE” and its synon-
ymous counterpart, “COMMUTATION.” This word
hasn’t any meaning for the greater proportion of
society except when presented—at times adversely,
and sometimes beneficially. The full meaning les
not in the pages of a book, but in the hearts of those
who must feel the weight of its judgement.

The men in prison serving long sentences are a-

ware of the need for the duly elected Board that com-
prises the complete function of Commutation. There

have been many opinions in the past, pro and con, as
to the real purpose of the Pardon Board of this state.
The adverse opinions have not always been met
favorably by those who are dependent upon its le-
niency. The reasons are all too obvious, for this is
the long-timer’s only ray of hope for freedom. This
hope has or is becoming a clouded light, unable to

penetrate the darkness of a disreputable environ-
ment. The main aspect of this statement is: “the
prisoner sees his years of rehabilitative efforts inun-
dated into nothing by the repeated eries of “Non
Freedom.”

For a number of years there have been attacks and
eastrating remarks on the judicial system as a whole.
The intramural agencies and boards have been great-
ly affected by these oral arguments. Rightly so, in
the opinion of the aspiring political despots. Wrong-
ly so, in the views of the laws controlling their par-
ticular job. Commutation’s modern definition seems
to be, “Wholesale release of undesirables.” This is a
fallacy and ean only be corrected by the Pardon
Board’s adoption of the intended methods of evalu-
ating release, the analization not only of the length
of time served, but of the prisoner’s rehabilitative
efforts, psychological reports, etc.
