be heard en bane by a panel of three judges, none
of whom had sat in the trial itself. This panel, he
said, should have the power to change or alter the
original sentence as it saw fit.

It is this writer’s view that this is an answer
to any susceptibility to human frailties on the part
of the sentencing judge.

RENEWED EFFORTS TO ABOLISH CP

Philadelphia area Quakers have renewed their
efforts to have the death penalty outlawed in Penn-
sylvania and New Jersey.

The historic Quaker opposition to capital pun-
ishment was reiterated at its 278th annual sessions,
held in the City of Brotherly Love.

The Quaker religious and moral position is
summed up in a revised “Statement on Capital Pun-
ishment”, which says in part:

“We believe there is no crime for which the
death penalty should be imposed, and that it is as
much forbidden to organized government to deprive
a human creature of life as it is forbidden the in-
dividual to do so.

“We hold life, given us by our Father, to be
sacred and hence not to be taken from any one of us
by the judgement of man.

“We hold it to be our duty to find methods other
than intimidation, cruelty, retribution or revenge
in coping with wrong-doing and erime.

“We aim to prevent crime by removal of its
causes and, further, to use modern methods for re-
habilitation of the evil-doer in order to bring about
his regeneration.

“We speak at this time because we are in the
midst of unrest and upheaval, when the outlook of
religion and the influence of the spirit are profound-
ly needed by mankind.”

Noting that nine states have abolished capital
punishment—the most recent being Delaware—a
committee report says of the other 41, where juries
give the verdict of life imprisonment or death, “We
eravely doubt that a decision so momentous should
be entrusted to the judgement of any group of un-
tra ned laymen.”

THE IDEA OF PAROLE

Co Mi. (Git, tm los = @oltmmm = RKOOID IFO
MAQOUGIAT”, wianeln ayoyoeaies mm wae Work, Pa, Gaz
ette and Daily, had this to say:

“The idea of parole we always thought, was to
give persons who have been sentenced for commit-
ting crimes against society time off their original
sentences for good behavior and displaying an atti-
tude conducive to rehabilitation. The main object
thus is to reward a person who shows or displays
willingness to follow the straight and narrow path
from now on. It seems to us that the obligations of
a parole system are to find evidence of this willing-

EASTERN EcHo

ness and to give those persons a reasonable and de-
cent chance to become good responsible citizens.”

“It seems to us the system should be interested
in making a man’s rehabilitation as easy as possible
through parole processes. The idea should be to
give him encouragement and support, not discour-
agement and lack of support when the going gets
rough and the persons who don’t believe in any-
body getting a second chance open their loud
mouths. The Parole System should grant parole to
those who really deserve it and then do everything
to justify it. The concern should be with the pres-
ent and the future and not with the past. The sys-
tem should go to battle for the parolee instead of
letting him down when the going gets tough.”

SECURITY WITH A HEART

California’s San Quentin prison is experiment-
ing with a new visiting set-up on a 3-month basis
and for the first time in many years some inmates
will be allowed to embrace their still loyal wives
and children.

Under this “Michigan Plan” inmates will be
permitted to have summer picnics while the children
romp on prison playgrounds, or visit family-style
in special rooms if the weather is bad.

Michigan has gradually made the system work
as a technique of rehabilitation, with the pendulum
swinging away from bars and the chain step. Air-
tight security remains—but with a heart.

An attempt to encourage normal contacts be-
tween men and their families and a change which
might increase the n ormaley of life in prison, were
cited as reasons for the new procedure.

HELPING THEM COME BACK

ATTORNEY GENERAL Anne X. Alpern’s of-
fer to help 500 boys get jobs and an education when
they leave the Pennsylvania Industrial School at
White Hill represents much more than a human
gesture.

She has drawn needed attention to a most vital
problem on the delinquency scene in the State and
throughout the country. That is the problem of re-
habilitating the offender, of offering him the chance
to lead a normal, constructive life.

When a man, old or young, is released from
prison or industrial school after “paying his debt

beginning of a new chapter, and how that chapter
will end depends not on him alone. The community
has a part to play, also.

transition period. It is then that the community can
help make or break him.
