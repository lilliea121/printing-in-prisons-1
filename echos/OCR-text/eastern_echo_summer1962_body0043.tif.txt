The prison journal is a typical reflection of administration policy . . . The Penal Press is
roughly divided into three groups. First, we have those under complete and rigid control of
the administration . . . printing little more than official news of the institution and dull plati-

tudes in the form of editorials.

On a higher scale are the magazines which add to the diet, morsels of fiction, humor and

comment, but under strict censorship rule to prevent the appearance of what the Japanese call

“wrong thoughts.’

At the very top are periodicals entirely free from official pressure. They alone have gen-

uine sparkle and vitality, and generate in the inmate population real interest and support.
