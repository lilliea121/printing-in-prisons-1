twenty-yard line, when the menace of
the Cobra’s team brought an abrupt
ending to their drive down field. You're
right, fans—Rob (Fumbles) Watson,
handed the ball haphazardly to his
quarterback where it spun from his
grasp into the hands of a charging
Wildcat lineman. That did it as far as
the Cobras were concerned; for two
plays later the up-tempo’d Wildcats
scored their final T.D. On this particu-
lar play Griffin threw a fifteen yard
pass to Wallace, who raced down field,
out to the left side line and caught it,
then spurted ten yards unmolested in-
to the end zone. Thereafter, it turned
into a defensive battle. It was a gruel-
ing sight to behold the linemen of both
teams battling to gain possession of the
ball; the blocking by both were terrific.
In the final few minutes the Cobras got
the ball and made their desperate move
to go in for a last ditch score. With
Cobras’
front linemen, Hank Myers, Joe Miller,
*‘Tampa Red,” Big Curley, and the old

veteran, Pigmeat, they made every ef-

bruising blocking from the

fort to put themselves in the scoring
column. But the resurgent Wildcats,
fought just as hard to deny them that
honor; and this they did as the final
whistle blew to end the Championship
game of 1962.

Both teams had their moments of
decision, and opportunities to score.
The individual members of each team
are to be commended for the sense of
fair sportsmanship which was displayed
on the field. The many fans watching
and rooting got all the thrills and ex-

citement they would have gotten watch-

ing an outside game. During this con-

test, there were a few disgruntled play-
ers from both sides, heated arguments,
and a bit of extra pushing by careless
hands that wasn’t meant to be person-
al. Yet, this is man pitted against man
in a battle of recognition and praise
from the throngs gathered there to be
entertained by the combatants. This
is man out to prove his strength on the
field of battle against his adversary—
and the winner strolled from the field
with heaping praise and loud applause
ringing and stinging their deafened
ears. The ego of the winner is some-
thing to behold when his team is the

victor.

The disconsolate losers, though hurt
deep within themselves, smile when
patted upon the back by those who say,
“You played a darn good game.” To
some, it is a victory, and to others it’s
small payment when your body is ach-
ing and stiff with pain from the con-
tact with the ground and opposing
players. But high above and not seen
by any eyes there is a Greater Force
that smiles upon them all, for He too,
enjoyed the game—and admired each
of them for a performance well-done.
In His eyes, each of them is a winner.
Is God not everybody’s All-American
Quarterback ?

The third team in the league (Mag-
gots), coached by Jake Welty and as-
sisted by his young quarterback, Bobby
Volkert, would have enhanced its chan-
ces if a more experienced quarterback
would have been available during the
Suki, their
regular quarterback, was traded to the
Cobras—and this hurt the

more than they knew. No team is any

latter part of the season.

better than its quarterback. It was ap-
parent that Bobby had an arduous task
before him, and his teammates were
aware of it also. This dire situation
didn’t hamper the team’s spirit, for they
got themselves ready for each game
with skull sessions and extra periods
of practice which did help them to win
some games and keep in contention
with the other two clubs. But it became
obvious that it takes much from the
body and mind of a quarterback, when
the pressure of hard charging linemen
keep you dancing in your backfeld,
and your passes are plucked from the
air by the opposition. This is enough
to make one go berserk, especially

when you're doing your darndest to

become a Y.A. Tittle.

This young field general is a “‘must’’

for the future. He did gain more ex-
perience from his lack of quarterback-
ing and is destined to make himself
known in the league in the coming sea-
son. For he knows that from “‘little”’
acorns, great oaks kiss the sky.’ The
Maggots had a fine bunch of players.
Jake Welty, who coached his team like
the solid leader he is, did a marvelous
job at keeping them positive in mind
and spirit. It was his keen insight into
the game that made them a greater
threat around the league. Bob Johnson,
their hard running fullback, was ter-
rific. His bone-crushing tackles made
the fans shutter with fright—it was he
who put the great Tommy Griffin out
of commission in the “Old Timers’’ and
“Young Timers” game.

With such excellent players as Pen-
cil Willie, Flip Fleming, Norman Pear-
son, all-around performer ‘Chief’
Knock Knock, “‘Hosea,”’ and the might-
iest lineman of them all, Ed ““The Blitz-
er’ Parks, they were a cinch to win.
Parks came on in the latter stages of
the campaign to win the best lineman
award for the 1962 season. Just watch-
ing him perform on the field, handling
his position as linebacker on defense,
and plugging and opening up holes for
his backs to smash through for the nec-
essary yardage needed for their first
down was a pleasure to watch. He was
just tremendous! In Parks, the Maggots
have a great football player, who keeps
his teammates alive with his constant
chatter and pep talks that urge them
on in the coming attacks. Jake, his
coach, has repeatedly remarked, how
fine a job Parks has done all season for
his team; and his teammates never
cease in praising his stature on the field
as their very own, “Sam Huff.” Long
after his playing days days are over,
he'll be remembered by those who
knew talent, and most of all, knew him
as a great and thorough competitor on
or off the field of sports. Yes, sport's
fans, Ed Parks measures up immeasur-
ably, as did the majority of the Mag-
gots!
