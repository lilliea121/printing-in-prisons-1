It is not an easy task to play what is
musically acceptable to all; there are grains of great-
ness in some of the old familiar standards, and this
alone would constitute a sowing which promises a

of our times.

rich and ear-pleasing harvest. We also have a few
modern arrangements of light and tasty Jazz, and an
original composition or two, such as “Along Came

May, penned so beautifully by Freddie Adams.

There is much noticeable enthusiasm among
the musicians, and the population has not remained
indifferent to this musical endeavor. Many have
expressed their pleasure at our Saturday and Sunday
“Yard Sessions,’ although we are at present a little
handicapped by the necessity of both practicing and

playing at the same time, in the same area.

It would seem almost impossible to play the
old standards with the effectiveness and spirit that
this group is now doing. The full development of
the melodies reveal themselves as dependent upon
the individual skills of the musician and the instru-
ments used. The chief ingredients are there, dy-
namics, rhythm and tone.

With the forming of the orchestra, talents
have been awakened that otherwise would be going
to waste. There is no specialization of the individ-
ual, it is entirely a group effort. These past few
months have seen the group moulded into a close-
knit, cohesive and well diciplined independent or-
ganization.

It is the sincere desire of the entire group,
that the institution officials will incorporate our group
into the institution's Concert Band, but let it remain
under inmate leadership, as it has been from its in-
ception; with the privilege of practicing and playing
in the auditorium.

All in all, I believe we are in fairly good shape,
musically for some winter-time inmate talent shows.

routines brilliantly and effectively. He also plays
