criteria in assisting them with making a determina-
tion, before they vote on the application: Recom-
mendations of the institution staff, parole counselors’
recommendations, summary of the inmate’s institu-
tional record and activities, previous educational
status, family history, occupational history, and
prior job stability before arrest and during ‘inear-
ceration, as well as- psychiatric and psychological
recommendations. Both men were quick to explain
that they objectively evaluate any applicant, re-
gardless of the nature of the offense for which the
man may be in prison.

Members of the Parolee Comittee attempt to com-
municate with applicants they have accepted, as
much as is possible, before their release from con-
finement. Following this, they assist him in finding
suitable employment, residence (if needed), and ad-
vice or counsel after release, as approved parole
advisors. They attempt to act as a buffer between
the unfamiliar outside society and the parolee. They
concentrate their efforts toward the man’s eventual
readjustment. :

Explaining that they have received full coopera-
tion of all institution authorities in the various
prisons to which they have extended their program,
Mr. Behr said, “At the start, we received a few ex-
pressed reservations by some of our members about
our work. But these have been essentially over-
come.”

Both Parolee Committee representatives are
pleased with the program and they are interested in
expanding it to more inmates. When asked about
their personal goals, they explained they wanted to
make life better for former inmates and everyone
else. The Committee was of interest to them because

of the program itself and its great potential in mak-
ing life better for everyone. Both men indicated
they had no personal fears in working with prisoners
or former prisoners. “They are human; they’ve
made mistakes; they need help—we want to give it,”
Harting said.

Behr said, when questioned about expressions of
feelings by relatives and friends regarding their
activities: “They look up to us for what we are
doing. We have interested them in our activities.”

On future plans: They would like the Jaycees to
support or establish a half-way house ;* consider
seriously the ECHO’s suggestion to start a chartered
Jaycee Chapter for inmates at this institution (simi-
lar programs have been established in other penal
institutions in other parts of the United States) ;
stimulate more community interest generally; and,
they would like to encourage employers to consider
hiring parolees directly from prison.

The idea of a Jaycee Chapter being established
here, will be presented to the entire membership of
the Junior Chamber of Commerce of Philadelphia,
in the near future.

I the event inmates have a need to formulate a
suitable parole plan, the staff of the ECHO suggests
you contact Parole Counselor Bristol to arrange an
appointment with representatives of the Jaycee’s
Parolee Committee. We are sure, in the majority of
coses, an applicant will receive all necessary
assistance.

* The Junior Chamber of Commerce of Philadelphia
proposed establishment of a Jaycee Chapter at SCIPHA
in September; however, the proposal was rejected by the
Bureau of Correction due to current policy considera-
tions. Both the Jaycees and the ECHO staff are disap-
pointed. —Hditor.

WHEN A FRIEND 1S NEEDED !

For approximately nine years, a crisp, distin-
guished looking gentleman has been visiting inmates
at the State Correctional Institution at Philadelphia,
as well as most of the other institutions within the
Bureau of Correction, assisting them in formulating
parole plans, counseling, and, generally, acting as
friend to a friend or friends in need.

William T. Colborn, Jr., admittedly, age 70 (al-
though he doesn’t look much over 60), who presents
the picture of a towering muscular, six foot giant of
a man—and he is, in fact, a giant amongst men—has

been functioning in this unofficial capacity at his

own expense for over 9 years.

Colborn, who served in the United States Army
during World War I as a first lieutenant in the in-
fantry, has completed two years of college and two
years of business school to prepare him for his life-
time career as a very successful life insurance un-
derwriter and general broker. He has been employed
with the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company for
thirty-five years, but first started his life under-
writing career with Equitable Life Insurance Society
on May 23, 1921.
