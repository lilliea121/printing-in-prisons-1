pitcher in Hassa Johnson, and his records speaks
for itself. He has pitched three no-hitters, and
against the other three clubs in the league. When-
ever the Falcon’s and Braves get together its a “do
or die’ affair. So far the Birds have taken the Edge
in combat over the twisting Braves—and the sec-
ond half is going to be even more thrilling than the
first was. It is known around the league that this is
still the team to knock off in order to win the cham-
pionship. The Braves have a hustling team, and once
it finds the winning combination they'll be mighty
tough to handle. With such die-hards as Chuck,
Mack, Rock, Johnson and Johnson, the ““‘Band Aid
Boys’ they are going to be tougher anyway before
the season ends. Their Manager Hayman is some-
what perplexed after making a swap that sent Massa-
nova to Detroit for Carmine and Gerlach. Now he
knows much too late that he goofed and is taking
headache tablets to soothe his fevered brow. . . tsk
tsk. Oh, well, he'll get over it the Falcon’s will see
to that.

The second place Giants having lost their lethal
punch with the desertion of several players in which
they disagreed with an umpire’s decision, has caused
the “Big Bad Giants’ to fold and are now headed
for the dark dampness of the cellar. The players
that deserted their team-mates left their club at a
time when they could have made the first-half race
even closer than it turned out. Probably they saw
the handwriting on the wall that the Falcon’s had it
this year and they couldn’t do anything about it. For
the Falcons and Giants are old arch rivals of the past.
Even though the Birds were defeated last year, not
once did they leave the field due to an umpires de-
cision or a bad call. We took our bitter pills as well
as the sweetened one, we were not surprised by their
actions, it had to come sooner or later. What dis-
gusted everybody around the league was the disre-
gard they showed for the league in staying together.
The balance of the Giants team were in bad shape,
for this made the others disgruntle and very low in
spirits to be sure. | take this opportunity in saying
to their fine new owner Frank Rouse, that he’s do-

ing a darn good job of getting his club in order for
the second-half. To those players such as Earl
Brown, Whiting, Samson and Jake Buck we in the
league admire your steadfastness in sticking with
your team that only last season won the Champion-
ship, and did in grand style to say the least. The hue
and cry of last season were the “Mighty Giants’’, for
indeed they were. This season of 1962, the cry is
“the High Flying Falcon’s’’—so it goes that chances
go around.

I'm hoping the Giants become stronger on the
field and at the plate as well, for this tends to make
the final half of the season even tougher for the |
Braves, Detroit and the Falcon’s. Who said, it could
not be done!

In the first half Detroit had sole possession of the
dark dismal cellar. According to record, they'll win
this honor once again, unless they come forth with
greater effort and more hustle in the second half.
They have acquired some additional players such as
“Tampa Red”’, Medina and “‘Chief’’ who could help
Detroit in the Beef Department if nothing more.
“Noisey’ Baker, their firey manager has been con-
fined to the hospital for minor surgery and his voice
has been missed along the sidelines and coaching
box. We're all hoping for his immediate recovery.
