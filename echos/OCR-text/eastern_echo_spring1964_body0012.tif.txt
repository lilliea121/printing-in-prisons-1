of the charges. Just as often the court accepts the
plea of a confused defendant whose sole legal knowl-
edge is acquired from fellow inmates while awaiting
trial, and can be just as varied as imagination allows
—and almost never based on the law as is applies to
his circumstances!

For the law to function properly it must be as-
sumed that the prosecution and the defense have
equal resources—the true adversary system. Compare
the assets the prosecutor has in most communities
with those of most penniless defendants. At his dis-
posal the prosecutor has a veritable army of highly-
trained investigators and legmen. In addition, he has
legal assistants who are specialists in every field of
law; laboratory technicians, the full resources of the
police department and numerous clerical specialists
assigned to the various agencies. Furthermore, an
array of the same technicians are at his beck and call
in every level of government: city, county, state and
federal. All these agencies are more than eager to
aid the state in the preparation and prosecution of its
case. It takes a maharaja or a Hoffa to even ap-
proach this challenge of power. A million dollars
couldn't marshal compararable resources ever ready
at the prosecutor’s discretion.

Next consider the state’s sympathetic grand juries,
the indicting bodies. Compare this formidable pha-
lanx of opposition against a destitute defendant with
a public defender who may or not have even a sec-
retary, to say nothing of an investigator. A far cry
from equal abilities and equal resources. Rare indeed
is the grand jury foreman who at the termination of
jury duty doesn’t recommend that laws be tightened
to insure prosecution of the indicted and more liberal
laws to enable the prosection to prepare its cases.
These foremen are guided solely by the influence of
the attendant prosecutor. This is the only viewpoint
to which they have been exposed, and a good reason
why their reports sometimes mirror a righteous indig-
nation with unreasonable and unsound recommenda-
tions. The grand jury receives credit for its delibera-
tions though in reality, it usually faithfully parrots
prosecutor views. The truth is it is he, more than
anyone else, who decides which cases should be pros-
ecuted and which ones dismissed. It is not unusual
for a defendant to have to contend with over-zealous
prosecutors, hostile police, a distorted press, and a
judge who yields to public pressure. The judge who
is a stickler for the observance of the defendant's
rights is so rare as to be newsworthy. His counterpart
who deals out justice on an assembly line basis is of
interest to none but the recipient of his jet-propelled
legalistic dexterity. It must seem particularly disturb-
ing to those aware of the uncontrolled powers of the

courts to see, during open trial, a solicitous prosecutor
whispering advice, instructions, of God knows what
in the judge’s ear. The most naive observer will then
be forced to reappraise his faith in true justice and
look with compassion at the defendant. This is com-
mon procedure in courts where the judge is new and
inexperienced—and in some courts judges appear
unable to conduct a trial without aid and guidance
from the prosecutors, no matter how long they have
been on the bench! Is it any wonder public defenders
have been accused of pleading too many clients
guilty ?

The question of appeal—from the failures of due
process, with it’s prohibitive expense for transcripts
(which in many courts the defendant must procure),
a brief writer, and a lawyer with appellate experience

—is a noble, abstract dream when one is without
funds!

Recently there appeared in the newspapers the

account of a man in Loisville, Kentucky, who after
numerous arrests for vagrancy, was again hauled into

court on this charge. Again he was found guilty.
Through the efforts of an unusually dedicated lawyer
who appealed his case all the way to the United States
Supreme Court, the conviction was reversed. In doing
so the court severely reprimanded both the law en-
forcement and the prosecuting bodies of the city.
Nevertheless this year thousands of men will be in the
exact same predicament, only they will be less fortu-
nate than the above-mentioned defendant. Their
guilty verdicts will stand. Their unjust penalties will
be paid. No lawyer will be there to see that due
process is obtained, that the dignity of the individual
is respected. So this practice will go on, and on .
The law will have failed with persistent regularity,

espite the concern displayed by our highest court.
These are not isolated cases we speak of here. They
happen as standard procedures every day in courts
throughout the land! They are happening even as you
read this!

What is the attitude of the legal profession as a
whole, regarding this breakdown of procedure? To
begin with, the legal profession itself looks down on
the practice of criminal law as one would look down
ona poor in-law. Are the top law students of our law
schools ever encouraged to go into criminal practice?
Very seldom. The law corporations vie with each
other for the services of the exceptional graduates,
and it is a matter of prestige and a signal honor to be
considered by these corporate giants. Careers in
criminal law are generally sought as a necessity; sel-
dom, if ever, by choice. The giant legal cartels from
time to time volunteer their services for the defenses
of the poor, as do some eminent lawyers and legisla-
