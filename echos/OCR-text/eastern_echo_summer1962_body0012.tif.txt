society can accept. Moreover, he will feel that he has
too much to lose by the lure of ‘easy money’ invita-
tions.”

Mr. Paull cites cases in which a secure job was the
prime factor in a man’s rehabilitation:

.. . I call attention to the private institution, a
home for the aged (of which, Mr. Paull is Chairman
of the Board), which has seven (7) ex-convicts on
its payroll. Without exception, each of them are re-
spected and trusted employees. Even more, they
have proven to be the most dependable and con-
scientious workers. And, too, each one was a ‘hold-
Gver’ case.

“One hundred percent rehabilitation by indivi-
duals whose records are as ‘long’ as the proverbial
arm! I could cite many similar records compiled by
ex-convicts employed in commercial houses, factor-
ies, garages, laundries, etc.’

Here we see the results brought about by gainful,
secure employment. But there is room for expan-
sion. Mr. Paull’s own words:

“There is a vital need to assist the many men who
are unable to formulate a parole plan and, thereby,
reduce the number of ‘holdover’ cases in State’s pe-
nal institutions.

‘‘How can that be accomplished? I am inclined
to hypothesize that an employment placement pro-
gram from within the various institutions may be the
solution to this problem. This, coupled with a vig-
orous campaign to awaken the public (particularly
potential employers) to the ‘holdover’ situation,
would be a step in the right direction. Penal authori-
ties cannot accomplish the task of rehabilitation
alone. They can help prepare a man for release, but
it takes the combined efforts of the general public to
complete the task of reformation—specific help such
as entailed in a sponsorship and employment pro-
gram, together with understanding and a sympathe-
aic attitude toward an inmate who is striving to be
reinstated to his former role of respected citizen.”

The idea, I’m sure you will agree, merits your con-
sideration and Tom will certainly second the notion.

The man behind the Idea? Let me tell you about
Mr. Joe Paull.

A bespectacled, 65-year-old meat market pro-
prietor, Joe Paull is no Johnny-Come-Lately in the
field of helping others. Mr. Paull first visited the
Institution in 1923, at the invitation of the late Al-
fred W. Fleisher (then Chairman of the Board of
Trustees). Mr. Fleisher met Joe during the course
of charity work Mr. Paull was doing at the Temple
Men’s Club and at the Eaglesville T. B. Sanatorium.

At Mr. Fleisher’s request, Joe Paull came to
Eastern and performed for the inmates his strong
man act which had earned him the title of ““The Iron
King.’” When speaking of this visit, Joe Paull will
tell you, “I always thought that in order to get some-
thing out of life it is much more important to help
human beings than to just make money. Helping
gives a certain satisfaction that money cannot buy.

“Well here was I, donating my services as an ath-
lete, entertaining men in trouble. Trying to bring
into their lives a few moments of something a little
different from their everyday routine. But I realized
at once there were more important things than just
being an athlete. In my prison audience were men
who needed other types of help. I resolved to do all
I could to contact rehabilitated inmates and directly
aid them.”

And what a job he has done!

In this year alone, Mr. Paull has already helped
fourteen inmates formulate the parole plans needed
for their releases from Eastern. Former inmates now
working at various jobs and conducting themselves
so well, as countless others of his selection preceding
them, have given Joe Paull added courage to go
on in his work, following his well-known and fully at-
tested policy of:

“| help anybody. Religion, creed or color make
no difference to me.”

Throughout his work, Mr. Paull has had many
helpers. Looking over the list of those who aided
him we note:

The late Dr. Lynn Bowman, for many years Di-
rector of Morals here.

William Portner, Sweater Manufacturer, and his
friend Al Light, both of whom were doing similar
work before ever meeting Mr. Paull, but who gladly
cooperated with this man. Through them, Paul! was
taken into the B'nai B’rith, where he was immediate-
ly appointed Chairman of Social Service. Since then,
when seeking to aid others, Mr. Paull has received
all the assistance he needed, both financial and
moral, from the B'nai B'rith.

When legal problems arise, Mr. Paull always
could go to William M. Gerber, International Vice-
President of the B’nai B’rith, who gave freely of his
time and advice.

The list is long, and Mr. Paull smilingly remem-
bers that:

‘“T also had the honor to work with a man who
came into the prison quite often,—Siegrnund Klein,

the father of Phillip Klein, publisher of the JEWISH
TIMES in Philadelphia.
