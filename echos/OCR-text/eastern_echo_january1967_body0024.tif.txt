tations. Neither of us made anything of the scanty
garment but the gnawing thought was always there.
Very politely tucked away and never mentioned,
but we knew it was always there.

Her dislocations and damaged ribs adjusted
normally in the miraculous way human injuries tend
to heal themselves, but the severe leg fractures took
much longer to regain their strength. I was well
satisfied with the general overall progress she was
making, and naturally quite proud and elated with
the part I played. We had reached the point where
we did not discuss her accident anymore, and even
though Sybil had never, at any time, acknowledged
to me that I had saved her life, neither did she
harass me any more for having done so.

When I was reasonably certain that she could
be trusted with her own safety, I fashioned a pair of
crutches for her, at her own insistance, and went
about the hunting and general preparations | knew
I would have to complete before the savage winter
had firmly set in. And during my absenses, from
time to time, Sybil undertook the task of finishing
up our winter canning.

One such hunt took Bo and me about a half
mile upstream from the cabin, where we searched
both banks for fresh deer tracks. I made it a person-
al rule never to shoot any easy game at my front
yard pool, and even Sybil made a_ favorable

comment on that when she asked me about it.

I was gutting the deer | had just bagged, a
fair sized eight point buck, when Bo barked for my
attention, not far from where I was working. He
had found a dead otter bitch a few yards above
the stream bank. She was still warm and limp, and
oozing milk from her torn underparts. She had lost
her last battle, and the noise from my hunting had
probably scared off her assissin. Bo located her
den in no time at all, and | tucked the two otter
pups we found there in my shirt, and brought them
back to the cabin with me, along with the dressed
down buck, which I carried fireman style.

Sybil really came to life with the addition of
the two baby otters. Lately she made quite a fuss
over Bo, petting him and brushing his coat, but with
the two tiny pups she really extended herself. Sybil
took over their care immediately and promptly
named the two little ones Hansel and Gretel, al-
though unknown to her they were both males. |
found this very amusing, but I didn’t spoil Sybil’s
enthusiasm over her choice of names. The pups had
slightly different markings which made it compara-
tively easy for us to tell them apart. Gretels affec-
tion for Sybil was such that the pup snuggled up to
her at every opportunity, whereas Hansel accepted
Bo as his own personal benefactor.

One evening, only a few weeks after the
arrival of the pups, Gretel got out of the nest |
made for the two baby otters and found its favorite
spot next to the sleeping Sybil. But sometime during
the night Sybil turned in her sleep, and when she
awoke in the morning, she found the tiny smothered
creature under her own curved softness.

Her reaction to this discovery verged on the
brink of hysterics. Her highly emotional display
had reached a nearly uncontrollable state before |
was able to level off her, terribly distraught condi-
tion early that same afternoon. I had some very
important chores to take care of then, so [| left Sybil
to her own silent remorse.

When I returned toward dusk, the cabin was
in a shambles. My brandy bottle was empty, lay-
ing flat on the table, and Syble was sprawled across
the bunk in a drunken stupor.

I was enraged with her; not because of the
cabin, or the brandy, but because she had allowed
what I considered to be only a minor setback, to
return her to the morbid state she had previously
been in. And I was determined not to have all my
efforts dissipated at this stage. I yanked her up to
a sitting position and viciously slapped her face
again, and again. She came out of her stupor at
once, howling with pain and holding her burning
skin, cursing me with acid bitterness.

“You son of a bitch!’’ She screamed. “You
dirty rotten son of a bitch! Leave me alone, will
you! You think you're so goddamned high and
mighty that you can plan my life for me? Well I’ve
never seen you walk on water, and you're worse
than I am. At least I had the guts to try and end
my problems. I didn’t run off in the woods some-
where and hide from everything like you did. And
now youre nothing but a Goddamned, pompus
preaching worm. You leave me alone now, and
don’t you ever touch me again!”

There was no retort from me, because what
she had said was partially true. We sat there quiet-
ly, until she regained some of her composure, and
then, as though the animosity that hung in the air
was not even present, we set about straightening up
the cabin again.

We retired shortly after dinner, she to my
former bunk and me in the cot across the room,
which I had built shortly after her arrival. 1
dropped off to sleep after a length of fitful restless-
ness, only to waken again deep into the night. Sybil
