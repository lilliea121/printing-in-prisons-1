(not custody) from one institution to another. More-

over, under these various individual interpretations |

of custody and treatment, prison life in a medium
eustody institution under one superintendent may
be even more disciplined and regimented than that
of a maximum institution under another superinten-
dent.

Some people may argue that the terms maxt-
mum, medium, and minimum custody mean orily
exactly what they say, and are merely designations
of custodial degrees such as “all walls, some walis,
and no walls,” and bear no reference to treatment.
The question arises whether this should be true in
view of the other policies of progressive penology
which have been adopted by the states. If so, let us
dispense with the formality of classification which
at present leads only to a custodial limbo.

However, if classification is to fulfill its role as
one of the basic operating principles of the new
program, let us honestly view its shortcomings. Let
us admit that the fault lies not in the operations of
the clinics, but in the reactionary tendencies of a
sometimes devious penal philosophy which pays
only “mouth service” towards the system of pro-
gressive penology. Let us realize that the adherents
of this undermining philosophy cannot see fit to
fully cooperate with what they strongly feel is a
foolish, pampering approach to a problem they were
never able to solve. Let us remember that the major-
ity of the penitentiaries in this country were built in
the days when penology called only for bigger and
higher walls.

Perhaps such admissions would clear the air,
and facilitate a further practical approach to the
problem. Then perhaps a closer study could be made
of the federal government’s classification system
which is operating more successfully. Budget prob-
lems would necessarily limit any extensive attempt
to duplicate the federal system, but perhaps some
of their ideas could be profitably borrowed.

Why couldn’t the states install a system of grad-
ation within each institution proper? Upon the
receptee’s transfer to whichever institution he was
assigned by the Classification Board, he would auto-
matically assume the status of third-grade inmate;
after a defined probation period he would be eleva-
ted to second-grade; and through self-application
and treatment could (and should) become eligible
for the first-grade. Hach grade would carry with it
attendant privileges, increasing in number and
value. A misconduct would automatically bring a
demotion in grade with its lesser privileges rather
than a useless trip to the “Hole.” Thus each inmate
would be able to map his own progress toward the

rehabilitation desired of him by society and himself, -
and would be rewarded for his efforts and coopera-
tion by advanced status as is a citizen in free society.

Why couldn’t the states redefine the classifica-
tions of maximum, medium, and minimum as applied
to institutions? Dependent upon the evaluation of
the Diagnostic Clinic, the receptee would be trans-
ferred to one of the three classifications. The major-
ity would probably be transferred initially to a
maximum institution, some directly to a medium
institution, and perhaps first offenders with shorter
sentences directly to a minimum institution. Each
differently classified institution would have attend-
antly increasing privileges and relaxation of disci-
pline in conformance with the principle that they
have been earned by the inmate. Treatment pro-
grams would be most intensive in maximum institu-
tions, leaning towards less treatment and more aec-
ceptance of the inmate as a future free citizen as he
progresses from one type of institution to another.
Those inmates confined in a maximum institution,
upon working their way through the three grades
within the prison would be eligible for reclassifica-
tion and subsequent transfer to a medium institution.
Those inmates in a medium institution would follow
a similar procedure to attain a transfer to a mini-
mum institution. Major infractions by any third-
grade prisoner of any institution other than maxi-
mum would bring about a re-transfer to a lower
class institution. Punishment of misconducts by de-
motion in grade or institution with lesser privileges,
more stringent discipline, together with the inmate’s
own knowledge that he was failing in his progres-
sion towards freedom would certainly be more ef-
fective than any dank “Klondike.” No inmate would
be frozen arbitrarily in any grade or classification
for any reason if he successfully completes the neces-
sary time for promotion without a further miscon-
duct. Those inmates in a minimum institution with
first-grade status would be guaranteed commutation
of sentence after a set period of time in that grade
since they have been screened for eligibility for re-
lease by rising through nine stages of custody and
three different classification of institutions. There
would be no setbacks upon application for parole at
the expiration of the minimum sentence of any of the
latter inmates for the same reason.

Space problems within this magazine prevent
any further detailing of the outlined system. Per-
haps the outlined plan seems radical in its entirety,
but a great many parts of it have already been suc-
cessfully applied by the military and federal penal
authorities. All departures from the status quo
seem radical to one group or another, but the train
of progress must go on. Whether or not. the pro-
grams of penal reform in this country are to be left
behind at the station depends upon the voters of
each state and their mandates to the elected authori-
ties. The ball is yours, Mr. and Mrs. Citizen. THE END

Learn from the mistakes of others — you can’t possibly live long enough to make all of them for

yourself,
