will ever be free of crime and prisons
become outmoded and antiquated?

That question can only be answered sup-
positionally. If this country will under-
take to revise radically its present cap-
italist system of government then I
would say yes. You see, when any sys-
tem measures the worth of an individual
on the basis of his wealth, this creates a
monopoly of wealth by a few. When the
have-nots are stymied in their attempt to
achieve what the haves have, then this
obsessional desire makes them deviate
from the so called normal method of a-
chieving same.

That answers only a small part of it.
What about the persons who commit
erimes other than of a financial nature?

These crimes will be eliminated through
scientific diagnosis and treatment. You
know, many psychologists, psychiatrists,
penologists and criminologists like my-
self are dedicating their lives to the men-
tal sublimation and/or eradication of
criminal thoughts, traits, habits, ete.

Do you think much headway is being
made in this direction?

Yes indeed! Of course, there are hin-
drances; and one of the biggest is the
justifiable crime they call “War.” Rather
than face the fact that people who sit in
high seats are not always tall...

Ha. Ha. I like that, professor.
Don’t be rude, sir.

I’m sorry, just a twitch of the old funny
bone.

Now, as I was saying... they are
oftentimes more devious in their under-
takings than the so called common man
or middle class.

What about putting only persons of a
super I.Q. in responsible positions where
so many lives are dependent?

No, this is only a partial answer. The
more intelligent a tyrant is the more di-
abolical tricks he can perform, cloaking
his schemes with sugar so that when the
true bitterness is tasted it is too late.
Then, of course, you have the opposite
extreme. This would be sheer idiocy
also.

I don’t think I should take up much more

of your valuable time, so [ll continue
with just the question part.

Quite all right. [’m rather enjoying it.

What do you think is the greatest outside
contributor to crime?

People!

Do you believe that all persons housed in
prisons are deserving of their freedom?

No, I surely do not. Because you have
people in prisons whose mentality is so
warped that it can be termed a useless
cause as far as treatment is concerned.
However, what I deplore is the indiffer-
ence showed to those who make an hon-
est effort to reconstruct their thinking
into a pattern that will fit society’s
standards. Years of effort without tan-
gible rewards is a very embittering ex-
perience. After an interminable length
of time has passed, a reverse psychosis
sets in. This is one of the reasons I favor
non-abolishment of the death penality.
Rather than suffer any animal to years
of torture I’d rather kill it.

Now, that’s a macabre bit of reasoning if
I ever heard one.

It only seems that way. Each person has
his own ideas as to what is humane or
inhumane.

Do you agree with some opinions that too
much money is being spent on prisons?

I think that too much money is being
spent outside the prisons that was ini-
tially meant for inside the prisons.

I think you are trying to say something,
sir.

What you mean is; I am making an un-
founded accusation. This may be true,
but past experience has attested to the
validity of my statement.

The next question is a delicate one and
one of which I hesitate to ask. Here goes
nothing, anyway. Do you.think the sex-
ual suppression of America’s prison pop-
ulation is damaging to society and/or the
individual?

Definitely. When you take a force that
is instinctive within us, all out of its
natural context, finding no outlet, it is
diverted and in turn reverted back to
self, creating a narcissism type. Self can-
