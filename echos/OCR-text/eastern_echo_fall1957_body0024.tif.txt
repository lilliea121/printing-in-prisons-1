league; DuPree and Jackson keep the team on
their toes.

CARDINALS:

Leading Hitter: Junior, .375

Leading Pitcher: Big Jim, W—2, L—1
Team Won: 4 Lost 4

Manager: Junior

This is a very good team and it will be interest-
ing to see where they end. Snooks, Long, Junior
and Seymour are the big bats. Big Jim, George
Sanders and Tommy are the pitchers and with any
help may go all the way. I look for this team to
make the Lynx know they are in the league and
must be beaten if the Lynx wish to win the second
half.

PHILLIES:

Leading Hitter: Joe Brown, .474

Leading Pitcher: Louis, W—2 lLost—2

Team Won: 3, Lost 3

Manager: Joe Rut

The Phillies were the team to beat in the first

half but for some reason or other couldn’t win the
big games at the end. However, they have in
Louis Weston, Joe Brown and Bogardus three of
the best hitters in the league; in Salty, who is one of
the most hustling players, they should be able to
make the league know they are in it. Not enough
pitching to go all the way however, so 2nd or 3rd is
the best we can see for them.

ROCKET ‘‘88’’:

Leading Hitters: Cleve & Swartley, .347
Leading Pitcher: Doggie, W—2, L-—2
Team Won: 2 Lost 5

Manager: Cleve

This is not a last place team; however, not
enough spark and poor fielding keep them at the
bottom of the league. Swartley, Cleve and Robin-
son are good all around players and help make
this a team able to beat any other if they play
as good every inning as they do for three or four
innings. No game is over until the last out.

“CARDINALS’”’
By Benson, Reporter

The Cardinals a new team which began the
second half in the Storehouse League and very
capably managed by Snooks and Junior is now
showing promise and remains very close to the
top, the Cardinals have shown a very good defense
and a concentrated offense with good power at the
bat and a will to win among the players themselves.
As the second half draws down the home-stretch
the Cardinals will be the team to watch and beat.
The team staff assisting the manager is; George
Sanders, Captain, Yancey, Coach and Benson, Team

team and player performance.

Mexican League
By George Tucker, Reporter
The first half of the Season of the Mexican

League is now History. It was won by the Rams. .
Lae Big Jim Ford, Manager.

OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE
FIRST HALF
League leading Hitter: Albert (Curly) Heath

O07 plus 10 home runs.

League leading Pitcher: Iron-man-Dave Won 15
Lost 5.

The Second Half started off with prospects of a
great battle to the finish. As of July 22, each team
had played four games. There was a four-way tie
for first place, each having a 2-2 Record.

The Rams are seeking a repeat performance.
The Bears, Dodgers and Falcons say NO!

THE RAMS... With the pitching and hustle
of Iron Man Dave and the fine play of Lock, up from
the Cuban League, I think the Rams mean a repeat
of the First Half. Both Earl Brown and Champ,
each hopping around on one leg, are still playing
good ball.

THE BEARS ... The Bears with No-No and
Joe pitching could be classified as the spoilers of the
League. Wild Man Levi is doing a good job behind
the plate. Buffalo with his good eyes and two inch
strike zone is forever getting on base.

THE DODGERS... The Dodgers have streng-
thened their team quite a bit since the start of the
Second Half. The Dodgers need some base hits.
Keith is the only consistent hitter on the team as of
now. Buzzard did a fine job of hitting in the first
half. Foots is a good team man. Stoop is back
with the Dodgers and is covering short field lke a
blanket. The Dodgers are aiming for first place.
They finished second in the First Half.

THE FALCONS ... Now here is a team to
watch. They have signed Walkie-Talkie who is a
good pitcher and he is tricky, too, keeps the ball mov-
ing all over the strike zone. With Curley threatening
to smack the ball out of the park and Third Base-
man, Horse, gobbling up everything that comes his
way fair or foul. Watch Out. Hx-Umpire Mays
is back with the Falcons, bunting as usual.

All in all, it looks like a good Second Half. May
the best team WIN,

Hats off to scorekeeper, Jake, for the fine job
he is doing.

P.S.... Remember men: Umpires Slick and
Toby are doing their best. You have a right to
Protest. BUT KNOW WHAT CAN BE PROTES-
