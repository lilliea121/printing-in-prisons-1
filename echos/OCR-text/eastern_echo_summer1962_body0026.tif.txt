THE INTELLECTUAL TYPE — Series 00-16

There is this intellectual type of inmate we invite
for a guest shot on the program. This man has 3 de-
grees from well known seats of learning, is very well
read, far, far, above the average, 150 1.Q., his
diction is faultless, his delivery is perfect, the tonal
quality of his voice is the envy of professional
announcers, plus the fact that he is a recognized
authority on Atomic Energy, nuclear fission, and if
there are Burma Shave Signs on Mars! So I study
like mad on several subjects in his field, and invite
him to be a guest on my program. When he accepts,
I am over-joyed and | tell all my friends to be sure
tonlistenmaeienenele So what happens?..... I open the
program in anticipation of a waterfall of interesting

facts and real intellectual conversation.

“‘What would you like to discuss, Mr. Flannery’’ ?

I say to him “What would you like to discuss Mr.
Flannery>”’..... He arranges his notes, runs a
hand through his thinning hair, stares off into the
distance, and says, “I was just wondering what
happens to all the guys who are nick-named Red,
when they are old and baldheaded ?”’

My listeners were also waiting in antcipation, but the
guards quieted them down after a while.

Later on he wanted to know if I knew, why there
are 300 John Smiths in the telephone directory and
not one single Pocohontos — gees, | didn’t know.

UNREFINED PRESSURE GROUPS 1929 STYLE

As to be expected in a place of this kind, there are

the pressure groups. The Disc Jockey will be taking
advantage of his exercise period by some brisk walk-
ing, when a weazel looking guy will detach himself
from a group of other inmates... .(locally known
as Dirty Mikes Mob) this weazel will walk along
side of you, shift his Bull Durham cigarette to the
corner of his mouth, and say, “hey crud, Dirty Mike
says you should play Mack the Knife three times
tonight or else he'll take your Victorola away from

99

you .

“«. . . Dirty Mike says, Play Mack the Knife, or else!!

I usually smile and say, “Oh yes sir, it will be a
pleasure’. Actually it ain’t a pleasure, I hate Dirty

Mikes 4. but as you know, I'm yellow.

On another occasion Big Dutch sidled up to me
in the mess hall and said, “you the D. J. Mac>”’
“Yes I am’’ I replied... “Where do you get your
records Mac?” he asked, all the while he was stuff-
ing a wet piece of bread in my shirt pocket, ““Why,
] get my records most everywhere ’, | informed him.
““Well Mac’ he said, “from now on your getting
them from me....see?’» He walked away mumbl-
ing something about Elliot Ness. I heard later on
that they transferred him to the State Laughing

Ncacdernnys ae I'm glad too.
THE DEBBIE OR 4F TYPE

Then there is the meek type, or if you will “‘Deb-
bie-4-F. It will hang around for hours just steeling
his nerves and getting himself prepared to approach

-you with a request... .for records, of course. His

face glistening with nervous perspiration, hands
clenched into tight little fists, a fierce determined
look in his eyes. He'll take 5 or 6 fast little mincing
steps toward you, stop suddenly in front of you,
scaring you half to death, you never know who's
out to get you remember. In a voice barely audible
