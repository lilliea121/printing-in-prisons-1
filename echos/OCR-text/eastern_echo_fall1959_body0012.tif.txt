“Tm only human. I could have made a mus:
take!” That was the sum total of the apology of-
fered for a false identification which caused an in-
nocent man to spend two months in jail. Fortunate-
ly, another man confessed and correctly identified
his victim before a prosecutor, judge, and jury had
an opportunity to compound this “human” mistake.
Two reputable witnesses had placed the original
suspect thirty blocks from the scene at the time of
the crime. However, this man was an “ex-convict”
with a record, and thus, seemingly guilty until
proven innocent, contrary to the law of the land.

Why was he originally under suspicion? Be-
cause the true culprit had been seen running down
the 200 block of a certain street, and the suspect had
once lived on the 400 block of that street. The de-
ductive reasoning escapes me, but it is a vivid ex-
ample of the snares that are liable to trip the releasce
who is trying to “go straight.”

A very prominent citizen of our town was re-
cently quoted in a newspaper editorial as follows:
“T think this case should be up before the jury in
about two weeks—the jury should be out for about
five minutes and come back with a ticket for Belle-
fonte, with no redress.”

Same citizen, same editorial: “There will be a
ereat many lawyers wanting to defend him and de-
feat justice—all for publicity. If ever there were
WO CUts Oli wor Whe INO SeAii, we Was Ulett joeue,”

After such statements from an educated man
is it any longer necessary to ask whether pre-trial
newspaper publicity affects the judgement of fu-
ture juries? His remarks are only a more literate
expression of the mob’s howl: “Lynch him!’

Delaware legislators must have misjudged the
popular appeal of barbarism in passing their short-
lived bill for compulsory public lashings. Like Cap-

tain Bligh, they were set adrift on a raging sea. In
this instance, public opinion which quickly con-
firmed a wiser governor’s reasoning that such an act
might be distasteful to the voters of the state. Sorry,
gentlemen, you'll have satisfy your strange desires
by some other means. Have you considered sclf-
flagellation?

A recent book, which shall be nameless here be-
cause of my reluctance to give it publicity, offered
photos of prison life as taken by a former inmate.
The pictures were very dramatic, and the captions
more so, but how truthful were the combinations
