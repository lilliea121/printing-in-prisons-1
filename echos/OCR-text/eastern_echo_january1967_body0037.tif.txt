Questions Of The Week Department

When a parolee is arrested he can-
not be released from the County
Prison on bail, because immediately
following arrest his parole agent
lodges a detainer against him for
“violating parole.’ In most cases,
the arrest itself is the sole basis of
the violation, hence the detainer,
which has nothing to do with regula-
tions and terms he previously agreed
to abide by. A parolee, faced with
such a circumstance, must languish
in the County Prison for many, many
months before appearing in court, all
because of this unfair arbitrary de-
tainer. In quite a few instances he is
able to prove his innocence and is
found not guilty as charged. We
would like to see changes made in
this area that would do away with
this unjust practice. Are we not in-
nocent until found otherwise? Should
not a parolee enjoy the same rights
as others, or should such rights be
denied him simply because he is a
parolee?

Also, why is it that many inmates
are denied parole by the Parole
Board even though they unfailingly
adhered to the institutional rules and
regulations, participated in various
constructive programs in an effort to-
wards self-improvement, worked dili-
gently at their assigned joband other-
wise kept their ‘‘nose clean’’ during
the serving of their minimum sen-
tence? The Parole Board, in many
instances, has looked askance at the
meritorious record built up by many
of these inmates because, in its
opinion, the inmate only did the a-
bove things because he is “prison
wise.’’ We feel that if an inmate
could weather the storm without get-
ting into any trouble, then certainly,
such a parole applicant deserves
kindlier consideration from the Board
than that.

WHY ISN’T INSTANT COFFEE SOLD IN OUR COMMISSARY?

The sale of instant coffee, in several different types of packages,
was tried at various institutions of the Bureau. However, the problems
that were created by this resulted in the adoption of a Bureau Policy
removing instant coffee from the Commissary Lists at all institutions
and precluding its sale and availability.

Our ol’ pal Ed. Brewer, who does
a swell job in the Ice Plant, finally
got his new number. Good luck to
you, Ed... After many years of bat-
tling in the courts it appears now
that No No will gain the freedom
that has eluded him for so long. We
are all pulling for you, No No. Henry
Sliva, our respected senior citizen
who resided on 7 block for so many
years, moved over to 9 block. In
spite of Henry’s heart-breaking dis-
appointment in his quest for justice
from the courts and the terrible bur-
den he carries (which would defeat
a much younger man), he still lends
an ear to anyone who has a problem.
Nobody has yet to say that Henry led
him astray. We take this opportu-
nity to tip our hats to a man who we
consider to be a noble person.

J guess you guys heard we have a
new dentist, Dr. Schwartz, and he
must really be good. From what I
hear, guys are tearing doors off
hinges fighting their way in to see
him.

Aliso, hear Clyde and Gilmore are
looking for a new T.V. for the hos-
pital for Christmas. Sure hope Santa
is good to you guys as you are to
every one who comes under your
care. You’re the best, fellas. Keep
up the good work.

For all you guys who haven’t had
a good laugh lately stop behind the
kitchen some time and watch those
two forty year old midgets wrestling
with those garbage cans.

Has anyone noted in their trips a-
round the place, whatever happened
to that rambling wreck we called a

Longest ‘stretch’ current -31lyrs,

greenhouse? Our thanks to Bob
Lightcap for a wonderful job well
done. Now the greenhouse looks
like a greenhouse. Too bad you
couldn’t get 50¢, Bob, and stay work-
ing out there in that place you fixed
so nice.

‘Also, note the new fad which is
volleyball. It seems to have caught
on great. All the guys are having a
great time. Very few arguments over
the score or anything else but Ten-
nessee, the Commissioner, let it be
known to this writer that if Johnny
(the snake) Welty can’t keep his lip
buttoned and stay out of the net and
on his side of the net he will have to
suspend him for two weeks and dur-
ing these two weeks he must sit on
the bench and keep score. Tennessee,
our Commissioner, although a midget
has really developed a good thing in
getting together this volleyball crew.
Good work, Midget.

Also, there is some Mexican guy
around here who thinks he is ‘“‘Baby
Roof,’’ his own words. And he keeps
saying he is entitled to a wild hair
once in a while. Wonder if he means
he wants one of those jackrabbits
from the Texas Panhandle. Guess
the guy is just homesick.
