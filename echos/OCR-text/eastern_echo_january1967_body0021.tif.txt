filled, and the throbbing vacancy it left was
crammed with irreparable shame. I had to escape
the foulness of my fanatic deed, but there was
no escape.

I felt an overwhelming need to apologize to
Beverly. To plead with her. To comfort her. But my
feet were now rooted to the same position | had
taken when I first found myself in her living
room.

We stared at each other, my skin prickling and
my face burnig with shameful remorse. She was
composed now, and expressionless, allowing me a
hollow felling of justification. I wanted to forgive
her then, to erase her guilt for the grief she had
caused me, but she stopped me with a facial gesture
and her defiant nakedness.

Then, as we both looked on in shocked dis-
belief, the discarted whip transformed itself into a
wriggling serpent. It slithered over to where Beverly
stood transfixed, and slowly and methodically coiled
its glossy body around her lower legs.

I wanted to run to her and destroy the calcu-
lating reptile, but couldn't move. Nor could she,
except for her one blocdied arm, which shot up to
cover her terror filled eyes. The room vibrated
again from the long, piercing animal wails that
rumbled out of her constricting throat in croaking
bursts. The drumming agony of her garbled screams
were unbearable from every aspect, and my hands
flew to my strumming ears in an unsuccessful at-
temp to block out the tortured chants.

I struggled fiercely to waken from the wierd
reverie and was finally rewarded for my trying
effort. I was still befogged with sleep, but merci-
fully, the incredibly evil scene vanished, as | tried
to pull myself from the depths of slumber. I was in
the process of very slowly orientating my thoughts
to reality when the same piercing scream slipped
through my baffling nightmare and rang out again.
I sat bolt upright; drenched with sweat!

It was the girl. Bo was standing over her with
his front paws on the bunk frame, his long tongue
lolling in that impossible canine grin and his tail
wagging furiously. It was obvious that Bo was over-
joyed by the woman's first loud signs of life, al-
though it was equally evident that she did not share
his enthusiasm. This was understandable when you
take into consideration that she had been only an
eyelash away from death. And then, to awaken
into harsh, pulsating pain and find herself in such

strange surroundings, being hovered over by what
may very well be, in her agitated condition, a men-
acing wild beast.

My own mental capacities had just undergone
a harrowing experience, so it took me a little longer
than it should have ordinarily, to gain control over
the situation. I called softly to Bo and he came to
me immediately, happy in his own way that our new
ward had voiced her presense. I went over to the
girl right away, but she had lapsed back into a semi-
coma and was breathing hard, oblivious to my
closeness. Nevertheless, | pulled over a chair and
sat with her for a few minutes. She didnâ€™t respond
at all, but intermittently she did open her eyes and
stare at me vacantly.

I spoke to her quietly for the first time, hoping
that my mellow tone and some of the reassuring
words would sink into her pain ridden subconscious.
I was quite happy and relieved to see that the ash
gray pallar was almost gone, a hopeful sign that at
least the dreaded symptoms of shock were vanishing.
Her face was flush and warm, but not feverishly hot.
She opened her eyes again when [| touched her, but
she did not flinch when I made another quick survey
of her multiple injuries. The strangled moans,
though, were strange and mournful, but gave mean-
ing to her otherwise hollow existence. I gave her
another shot of morphine and some strong mint tea,
laced with a generous dose of the good brandy I had
been hoarding for some time. And the combination
of those two soothing remedies soon had her back
in deep slumber. Only this time she was sleeping
peacefully and not hammered into unconsciousness

by murderous pain.

I changed the bandages on the head cut and
other wounds and checked to see whether the splints
I had applied to the broken bones were too tight. I
had seen enough of what gangrene could do, first
hand, during the war in the Pacific, and did not
want a repeat of it now. Satisfied with the con-
dition of the fractures, | then restrapped the loose
raveling on her sprains and the rib bindings that had
slackened somewhat during my long sleep. The girl
moaned a few more times as I worked over her, but
the opiate had done its job and she never stirred.

I took a cold plunge in the pool to erase the
foggy feeling that still shrouded me. Then I fixed
a hugh meal for Bo and I, and did some serious
thinking about the girl and about myself while we
ate. It was almost useless to piece together anything
about the girl, because only she could clear up the
mysteries surrounding the crash. As for myself, |
was completely baffled by the horrible nightmare |
had, because up until this time I felt I had success-
fully shed all the hurt and animosity that had sent
