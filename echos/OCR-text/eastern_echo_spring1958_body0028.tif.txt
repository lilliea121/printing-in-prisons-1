‘he shrill blast of a whistle broke the rising dawn
asunder, and shattered the darkness into a
million pieces. The rain that beat a relentless tattoo
against the thick wall ceased, and a watery sun sent
feelers toward a forgotten earth.

Inside a massive stone fortress-like building, is
a world alone, a grim world of sweat and disinfectant,
of stone and steel, cement and hopelessness.

Activities begin slowly, and with an increasing
erescendo. There is a clang of key against metal
as locks are opened, bolts pulled, locks reshut. A
voice follows each clang with a ery of, ‘‘ Doctor,

Within the confines of cell 44 lies a forlorn, ill-

backs of his schoolmates. Some of the girls had their
hair done up, others had braided pigtails tipped with
flaring red or blue bows, which rested like little
butterflies on their gingham dresses. Most of the
boys looked tan . . . scrubbed and uncomfortable.

There were many experiences to be exchanged,
but these would be deferred till lunch hour. Then
