Our Football Season opened on Sep-
tember 28, 1963 with Big Mack’s Blue
Giants taking on the Giant-killing Pack-
ers. The results of the game were:
Packers, 25; Giants, 0. While the Pack-
ers, managed by Lujack, were reason-
ably well organized, the Giants blared
out a din of confusion leaving the score-
board at the mercy of Lujack’s backs,
Pinky, Richie and Socrates Cantoral.
Big Mack’s Giants would again suffer
the penalties of dissention among a
squad on the field. Packer Quarterback
Harry Zietz capitalized brilliantly, if not
amazingly, with the highest score this
institution can remember against the
Giants (55-0) at a later date. The Pack-
ers, however, weren't Devil-killers, as
Teasey Brumskill adequately reports on
the game which ultimately decided who

would prevail as Champions.

The 1963 Football Season came to
an end with the Red Devils squaring off
with the Packers for the Championship.
The Packers took the field confident of
victory; the Devils were determined to
win. The most notable thing about the
first half was the starting kickoff. The
ball was kicked to Nick who took it on
the run crossing the field, handing it off
to Wally who reversed his field picking
up blockers and went fifty (50) yards
before being pulled down from behind.
It seemed now that the Devils would

surely score early in the first quarter,

but the Packers’ defense was too much
with the front wall consisting of Hosea,
Pencil Willie, Cisco, Gazaille and Kings-
ley. The Packers then took over the ball
with Zietz calling the plays from quar-
terback, Richie at halfback and Sukey
as his running mate at the other half-
back slot and Stanley Moroz running
from fullback. For this game the Pack-
ers had their best fullback playing of-
fensive guard because of an untimely
injury to their starting lineman. It was
also notable in this game that Lujack

tween the two teams.

In the third quarter Lujack moved
from center into the quarterback slot
and it seemed that the Packer's were
on the move, but the fine defensive play

that Nathaniel Easley was playing his

the Devils to pick up needed yardage to
assure them a first down. Massey took
to the air, this time hitting Terry Ross
inside the Packers’ ten yard line where
the ball was spotted on the six or seven
yard line. Massey then crossed up the
defense by calling a running play which
picked up another four yards, then hit
Terry Ross in the end zone for the
touchdown. The extra point was scored
by Teasey on a slant from right half
through the left half slot, which made
the score read Devils 7 and the Packers
0 with the clock running out fast.

Lujack again started his team mov-
ing like the quarterback he is noted for
being with a strong determination to
either tie or win the game. He then
hit S. Cantoral with a short pass which
gave his team first down on the Devils
