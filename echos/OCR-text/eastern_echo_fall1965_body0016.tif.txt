The University of Pennsylvania won the College
League Tournament and we won the Industrial League
Tournament. Scoring honors went to James Ryder, who
had four wins, two draws, and one defeat.

RESERVE SECTION

The Reserve Team’s performance was not on par
with previous performances because of the inexperience
of the players. At the start of the season, our team
had many seasoned players who, for one reason or
another, had to be replaced by players with little or no
experience. These fellows gave a good performance!

PHILADELPHIA'S
UNIQUE
CHESS CLUB

by MORDECAI TREBLOW

Philadelphia’s Benjamin Franklin Parkway is a
beautiful tree-lined boulevard running northwest from
City Hall to the Art Museum. Along its borders are
many fine public buildings and museums built in the
classical Greek style used in our nation’s capital.
Here, in recent years, many fashionable apartment
houses have displayed the most modern architectural
design. However, less than four blocks north of the
Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 21st Street, sits a
building of medieval architecture complete with thick
walls and commanding towers at each corner. This is
the Eastern State Penitentiary, one of Pennsylvania’s
two maximum security prisons. Imprisoned here are
about 880 inmates, all of whom have been found guilty
of felony crimes. Approximately one-fourth of the

inmates have received life sentences.

Yet within these grim and massive walls resides

one of Philadelphia’s most active chess clubs and
certainly one of the most unusual in the nation. ‘The
Eastern State Penitentiary Chess Club, or ESP Club
as it is popularly known in Philadelphia circles,
boasts a membership of 76 which is well over 10% of
its potential. | certainly know of no other institu-
tion that has so high a percentage in its chess club.

The ESP Chess Club was started in 1957 and it
joined the Philadelphia Chess Association in 1959,

entering teams in both the Championship and Reserve
League; it is a charter member of the PCA’s Indus-
