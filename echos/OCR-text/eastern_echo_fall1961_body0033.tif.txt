of 530 Ibs. In third place was Jim Cook. Cookie’s
lifts totaled 510 lbs.

In the middleweight division, William Archy’s
combined efforts gave him a total of 570 lbs. Five
more than second place Dave Gibbs whose efforts

came to 565. Harry Zeitz captured third place with
550) Vas.

The lightheavy weight ranks saw a display of
power as Bob Solomone averaged 234 lbs. on each
of his lifts for a grand total of 70214 lbs. Runner
up was Francis McLauglin who sported a total of

680 lbs.

The heavyweight crown was given to “Big John”
Janaski who had no competition and lifted a total
of 540 lbs. The lifts were no indication of John’s
capabilities and it is to be hoped that next year there
will be more heavyweights on hand to pace him.

Meanwhile three block field was the scene of
joviality as the Sack race got underway. With a
couple of dozen entries two heats had to be ar-
ranged. Hopping to victory in the first heat Leon-
ard Massey edged out Nickens while ‘‘Irish’’ finished
third. The second heat had Jimmy White finding
victory in the bag while Turk shipped in second and
Billy Hollowell was a hard luck third.

In the next event Hollowell did gain a victory as
he and Ray Thompson galloped to first place in the
horse and rider contest. Ernest Jackson and Billy
Holley finished second while Earl Brown and Bob
Cullen loped in third ahead of Frank Bordner and
Jim Cook.

The afternoon wheelbarrow race was a team
effort for Dave Croxton and Al Shep who finished
first. Turk and Massey placed second while Ray
and lrish were third. Jassey and Chico took fourth.

As predicted by your Echo reporter, when the
season first opened, Croxton’s Giants ran away with
the pennant flag for the second year ina row. ‘The
rest of the league was very well balanced once
Detroit came up with a steady pitcher.

For an analysis of the first half, let’s take a look
at each team and its personnel in their order of fin-

ish.

The Giants — Dave Croxton, Owner Mer.

William Sampson C.F. Charley Whiting lb

C. Holland 2b Francis Murphy Ib

Jake Buck 3b = Junior Creditt Se.

Karl Thornton L.F. Ernest Jackson R.F.

Earl Brown P W. Wilson Ss

Dave Wilder P Charles C. Clark L.F.
Freddy Adams R.F.

The key to the Giants phenomenal pennant drive
was not paralyzing power at the plate, but brilliant
defense, team spirit and the bewildering array of
pitches thrown by those aces of the mound, Dave
(The Iron Man) Wilder and Earl Brown. The
Iron Man still possesses the power to throw aspirins
past the batters while Earl has developed a tantaliz-
ing curve that has baffled the best of Eastern’s hit-
ters.

Behind the plate, W. Wilson, (Arkansas) has the

weaknesses of the opposing batters down to a sci-

Eastern Echo

ence and also wields a powerful bat of his own.
Another of Croxton’s game winning gimmicks is the
platooning of players in key positions. The initial
sack has two players of equal ability sharing honors.
Charley Whiting is a fine glove man while Francis
Murphy can come up with that long ball. C. Hol-
land is cat-like in his playing of second base and at
the plate is an artist in the technique of getting on
base. The shortstop position is the private concern
of Croxton and his workman like job sets a fine ex-
ample for the rest of the team. An old friend of the
Echo sports pages, Jake Buck, the Giant stellar third
baseman, is equally adept at hitting or gloving hot
line drives.

Much of the Giants success must be credited to a
hit-proof outfield combination. The left field zone
is patrolled by Karl Thornton and any ball hit his
way is considered ‘‘down the well.’’ Center field is
the domain of William Sampson who has the speed
to cover his own territory and also back up the other
fielders. Ernest (Lucky) Jackson has been given
custody of right field and is miserly when it comes
to giving up a hit in his section. Junior Creditt al-
ternates between the short-field and catching chores.

A strong bench features Salty Powell, a clutch
pinch-hitter, the fine glove of C. C. Clark, and one
of the best infielders around, Freddy Adams.
