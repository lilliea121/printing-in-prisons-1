An Analysis
of the

by L. J. BIANCONE

While many gains have been made throughout
the American penal system in recent years, prisons
without incentive benefits incorporated into their re-
habilitation program apparently will continue to be
rated as dismal failures.

TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT

The terrifying realization that most of our
prisons are not rehabilitating a larger percentage
of their prisoners presents a significant problem for
society in general. Yet this same society seems to
be satisfied with the ‘‘out of sight, out of mind”’
attitude, notwithstanding the fact that 95 per cent
of all prisoners are eventually released from prison.
Penologists, on the other hand, urge treatment and
rehabilitation. The high percentage of inmates re-
leased. ... justifies the latter attitude. However, the
prisoner is ensnared between two schools of thought,
and is more or less left to shift for himself. Simply
marking time, so to speak, the inmate waits and
hopes for the: proverbial break, which usually only
comes at the expiration of his burden . . . obviously
too late. Thus, the psychological impact upon so-
ciety must be fatal. Whereas, a logical incentive
program could have materially helped to produce
the opposite effect—self-reorientation and adjust-
ment.

RING OUT THE OLD

Eastern State Penitentiary was the first peni-
tentiary in the world. Its history goes back to
1790, when it was converted from the old Philadel-

phia Walnut Street Jail. This penitentiary, in-
tended as a place of penitence, was first conceived
by an Englishman, John Howard. In 1828 the
present institution (Cherry Hill) was erected, and
designed to conform with the penal philosophy of
Mr. Howard and his associates, who were laboring
under the premise that prisoners have a contaminat-
ing influence upon each other. Thus, separate and
solitary confinement was adopted. Result: Prison
stupor, commonly known as the state of being ‘‘stir
crazy’’, and more hardened criminals. The system
was abolished in 19138.

RING IN THE NEW

Psychologists, and other trained personnel, per-
haps achieved the greatest gain in penal reform in
the early 30’s when classification of prisoners was
adopted. The philosophy behind this system is an
attempt at group segregation; i.e., prisoners of a
like status .. . which includes, among other char-
acteristics, age, attitude and previous crime ex-
perience ... are housed, whenever possible, apart
from dissimilar groups. This method has been found
a proven success in the elementary stage of ‘‘reach-
ing’’ the prisoner. However, it has its drawbacks,
too, which are usually due to lack of facilities such
as buildings, staff, personnel and a failure to ‘‘follow
up’’, as well as the inevitable lack of incentive
benefit.
