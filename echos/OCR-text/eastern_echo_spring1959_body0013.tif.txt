eurity is the function of determining the amount of
restraint necessary for the safekeeping of the pris-
oner. We may all agree that this service (actually
a side-product of classification) is successfully ac-
complished.

Of more importance to the public and the in-
mate is the second function of evaluating the needs
of the prisoner (in the terms of society) so that he
may be successfully treated, rehabilitated, recivil-
ized—ceall it what you will, prior to his release and
thus justify the program. Since it is well agreed
that the initial evaluation is thorough and efficient.
it should follow that the determined treatment
should be effective.

Yet, it is highly doubtful whether any correla-
tion exists between classification and future treat-
ment. Partisan defenders of the system are usually
well-armed with batteries of statistics which sup-
posedly prove the effectiveness of their program.
However, these statistics generally show only the
acknowledged improvement in the percentages of
successful rehabilitation as determined by parole
behavior, etc.

As an inmate the author would be the last to
argue that newly adopted programs of “custody com-
bined with treatment” have not been effective in
their efforts to increase the successful rehabilitation
of inmates. However, could this not be in spite of,
rather than because of the present classification sys-
tems? Could it not be that the success of programs
as a whole is due to the general improvements in the
relationships of the inmates, officials, and society ;
the higher qualifications demanded of employees,
from guard to director; physical and mental therapy
programs; the Vocational Industries program; more
contacts between prisoners and the public, and the
numerous other beneficial aspects fostered by this
new trend in penology? Is it not possible that an
overhauling and improvement of the classification
system would raise those self-same statistics to yet
ereater heights?

The cause of the present day successful treat-
ment of the inmate can only be determined by ob-
serving the direct effect of the many individual
factors. Such observation of the classification sys-
tems, if honest, can only draw one conclusion—that
it has little, if any, effect whatsoever.

Uhies completion of the receptee’s dossier, he is
interviewed by the Classification Board. It is the
duty of the members of this board to jointly organize
an individual program of treatment for the inmate
concerned. They are to be guided in their decisions
on future employment, quarters, type of custody,
ete., by the reports compiled earlier by the indivi-
dual members of the staff.

As stated previously, the reports are amazing
in their depth, and could be invaluable in choosing
a course of action. Paradoxically, they are practi-
cally useless under the present system, and a waste

of time on the part of the men who worked against
time and a rising reception rate to create them. The
members of the Classification Board, however earn-
est their desires, must temper their decisions to suit
more mundane factors than the records before them.
The word “classification” carries with it a connota-
tion of “placing into different groups according to
evaluation.” Accordingly it would follow that the
receptees would thus be placed into varying strata
of prison society by this classification. However,
other than a few limited differences in custodial se-
curity, such strata do not exist under the many
systems. This places the Classification Board in a
quandary similar to that of a fruit-grader who stead-
ily classifies oranges or apples as “small, medium,
and large,” and then has only one basket available
in which to place all of them. This situation can only
lead to frustration and a steadily increasing “who
eares” attitude toward classification on the part of
the grader.

A t present there are four types of institutions _
which may be said to contain distinctively limited
populations: State Industrial Schools, for youthful
male offenders; State Industrial Homes for Women,
for female offenders; the State Institutions for De-
fective Delinquents, and Penitentiaries for male
adults of varying degree custodialwise. Thus, a
receptee falling clearly into one of these classifica-
tions 1s easily and properly disposed of by transfer
to one of the above institutions.

A eritic may seize upon this fact to point out
that, unlike the fruit-grader with only one basket,
the Classification Board thus has available four dif-
ferent institutions varying in custodial degree from
maximum to minimum. This may seem advantageous
to the uninitiate, unaware that the varying labels
alone do not make for varying classifications of in-
stitutions. Under the classification system as orig-
inally outlined, the definitive titles of maximum,
medium, and minimum should not only designate
physical differences in degree of “escape-proofness,”
but also differences in general treatment in line with
the recommendations of the Diagnostic Clinie and
the Classification Board.

Necessary considerations such as over-crowd-
ing, problems of proper employment, physical dimen-
sions, ete., have had a tendency to blur the defini-
tive lines between the varying degrees. 'l'o a greater
degree, the sometimes meritable latitude of inde-
pendent action permitted the various superinten-
dents has resulted in individual alterations of the
specific intended - philosophies of treatment and
brought about a deleterious change in the entire
classification structure which completely offsets the
original purpose of the receptee’s transfer to a spe-
cific institution.

As a result there is little variance in treatment
