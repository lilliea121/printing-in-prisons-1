this stage it doesn’t matter as his posi-
tion is lost.

RESERVE SECTION

After suffering severe setbacks by
Marple-Newtown (114-314 and Post
#396 (1-4) the Reserve Team bounced
back with identical 314-114 score over
Bridesburg and Castle. With seven
matches remaining the team still has

the opportunity to finish high in the
standings. First place is definitely out

Grom Our Ch

of their reach, but it would not be too
optimistic to expect either a third or
fourth place finish.

CHAMPIONSHIP SECTION

The Championship team has shown
marked improvement over the play of
the previous season. This section has
some of the strongest players ever to
compete in the tournament. Franklin-

team has a victory over the Pawn Club
(4-1), a draw with the University of
Pennsylvania (214-214) and losses to
Greater Northeast (1-4) and Franklin-
Mercantile (1-4). The four remaining

The Law and The Gospel

Rey. Nathaniel Williams

Protestant Chaplain

The law and the gospel do not go in
company. They are by nature as far
apart as life and death. The one is the
ministery of death, and the other of
life. The law is the whip-lash of judge-
ment. The gospel is the silver bell ring-
ing anthems of love. The law brings a
work to do, the gospel brings a word to
believe.

The law is the reflex of one side of
God’s nature; it reflexes God as Judge
sitting in His chamber waiting until
man goes wrong, then man has to con-
front Him for sentencing.

The gospel is the good news that the
law has been honored, the claims met
and God satisfied: the good news that
Jesus honored the law in life, met the
penalty in death, and at God’s right
hand, a risen man, witness of God’s
eternal satisfaction. The gospel brings

the good news that there is foregiveness
with God, and that life eternal is his
gift. It brings a new life, in which and
by which, we may live above the law,
so binding us to the heart of God in
vital union with His Son, that we need
no atom bomb threats to keep us right,
but filling us so full of Christ if we will
ite that we may love one another as
brethren and neighbors in the Lord,
even as we love ourselves, while we
love the God, in Jesus the Christ, with
all the mind and strength.

In the words of the poet Mr. Kipling
in his poem “‘If’’, sets us a series of
hypotheses and I think it brings us
right down front nearing the task of
living under the law in the gospel. Mr.
Kipling said:

“If you can keep your head when
all about you are losing theirs and
blaming it on you;

If you can trust yourself when all
men doubt you and make allow-
ance for their doubting too;

If you can wait and not be tired
by waiting or being hated, don’t
give way to hating;

Or being lied about, don’t deal in

lies and yet don’t look to good or
talk too wise;

If you can bear to hear the truth
you have spoken’ twisted by
knaves to make a trap for fools;
And watch the things you gave
your life to, broken, and stoop and
build them up with worn out tools;
If you can trust your nerves and
sinews to serve their term long
after your gone;

And hold on when there is noth-
ing except the will which says to
them hold on;

If you can take one heap of all
your winnings and risk it on one
turn of pitch and toss;

If you can fill the unforgotten
minutes with sixty seconds worth
of distance run;

Yours is the earth and everything
that’s in it, and what is more,
you ll be a man, my son.”

The truest way to bring men under
law to God so that His will shall be
rightously obeyed, is to preach the gos-
pel, the good news of God’s love. Then
shall it become true, that ““we love Him
because He first loved us.”’ For the law
was given by Moses, but grace and trust
come by Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.

SAINTLY HOODLUMS

Because of apparent similarities a
prison is sometimes compared to a
monastery. There is a likeness in the
imposing stone structures, the regular
routine, discipline and confinement of
the inhabitants. The big difference,
however, is that the monks have freely
chosen their lot while the courts have
decide the fates of the prisoners.

Consequently, the attitude of monks
and prisoners is at a considerable vari-

32

ance. A monk radiates joy because he
has found freedom in his free choice
of detachment, whereas, one confined
in a prison against his will has lost free-
dom and is anything but happy.

So it seems rather incongrous to
speak of finding joy in a prison. Never-
theless, there are exceptional individ-
uals who have experienced true happi-
ness for the first time in their lives due
to forced confinement. Looked upon as
religious fanatics by some of the per-
sonnal and taunted by the sly remarks
of fellow inmates they live dedicated
lives in reparation for past offenses.
Inasmuch as the atmosphere of a prison
isn't very conducive to a pious exist-
ence these rare souls are perhaps more
heroic than some religious. Behind

iron bars in the seclusion of a cell
these so called hardened criminals find
peace and contentment in pious con-
templation.

This chaplain must confess that he
views with suspicion any sudden osten-
tation of religious conversions and is
especially wary of those who put on an
act for the benefit of the officials. But
it has been his consolation to see many
who were sincere in their intentions
and have persevered under most try-
ing conditions. Of course, there will
always be the cynics who cannot accept
the fact that some of the worst sinners
became the greatest saints. All they
have to do is recall the scene on Cal-
vary when Dismas, the penitent thief,
was given the assurance of Paradise.
