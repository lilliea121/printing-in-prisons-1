aecept a much easier assignment. That of just being,
Mr. Citizen.

You gentlemen, who have children—did they
ever make a mistake? If they did, you punished
them for it. However, they were not rejected after
the punishment period had been finished. Didn’t
you ‘‘eut the punishment short’’ on occasions? I
am sure you did. You felt that they had learned
their lesson, and would not make the same mistake.
But, you probably cautioned the child on future
conduct. Perhaps you even told him of the punish-
ment he might expect if he did it again. Wasn’t
this a type of “Parole? Oh yes, the nature on
our crimes are proportionately greater. However,
the length of our punishment is greater also. But,
the authorities thought that we had learned our
lesson. So, in some cases, they are “‘cutting the
punishment short. We are being placed on parole.
We know what to expect if we fail to justify their
confidence. But our parole needs the sanction of
other people besides our parole authorities. We need
your vote of confidence and acceptance. Without
it, we cannot be released. You see, you are a very
important person in the whole program. You might
even be compared to Nero. ‘‘Thumbs down,’’ we
go back to the dungeon. ‘‘Thumbs up,’’ we have a
chance to fulfill the life for which we were intended.

From another viewpoint, look upon us as possible
value to your company. For this purpose, compare
us with the inanimate. Supposing you were in the
market for a machine needed for production. Nat-
urally, you desire a machine that can do the necessary
job at the least possible expenditure. Your decision
is between two machines. Both salesmen are, under-
standably, praising their product. One of them,
however, frankly tells you of the former bad points
in his machine. He tells you, that his company
wanted the product to be ‘‘right’’ before presenting
it to the consumer. He further tells you, they
dedicated five years to additional research, and took
the machine off the market, until they were assured
it would do the job it represents! He finally offers
you an amazing proposition. His company will give
you five years of free service on this product, until
you are assured the machine is entirely satisfactory!
Would you be impressed? J would be.

Surely, you can see the parable. That is ex-
actly what we offer in a man released on parole. Our
product was taken off the market. We have had
the product under surveillance and expended monies
in research. We have diligently worked to dispense
with the ‘‘bugs’’ in our product that made it pre-
viously unfit for public consumption. Our staff is
assured that the product is now ready for the market.

However, we shall give you, free of charge an in-

spection team ecomprised of a parole agent and
sponsor. They will insure proper functioning. We

6

want the product to be all it represents. Rest as-
sured, if our product doesn’t function properly, it
shall be returned to the factory for more research.

So much has been printed about those parolees
who failed, that I cannot ‘‘pass-up’’ the opportunity
to publicize a man who made good. I am certain
that many of you have heard of Charles Ward. He
is the head of Brown & Bigelow. The head of this
huge company served a term behind prison bars.
Then he went out and became a multimillionaire.
Mention of this is made by Erle Stanley Gardner in
the March issue of Argosy.

An exeeption to the rule? Only in two ways.
In becoming a multimillionaire and, in not carimg
about making the fact known to the public that he
is an ex-convict! You see, gentlemen, Mr. Ward is
in a position where the petty malice of other people
cannot harm him, nor his family.

As I have previously stated, we do not ask much.
We do not seek preference over others. We don’t
believe, as others would have you think we believe,
that the world owes us a living. We are only asking

~ to be met halfway. We only wish to be considered

for our ability and potentiality. Many of us have
the abilities you seek. We hope that you will come
to understand and consider us as potential, useful
manpower. We have been analyzed. With your
cooperation, we would like to be utilized. EE]

As Exchange Editor of “THE EASTERN
ECHO,’ my duties are to read all exchanges re-
ceived from other institutions, and to make notes on
articles and stories that will prove interesting to
our (THE ECHO) readers.

One of America’s foremost Penal Press Publica-
tions is ‘‘THE MENTOR” published by the inmates
of Massachusetts State Prison at South Walpole.

In the April 1958, issue of THE MENTOR, two
items struck me as ideally suited for this issue of

THE JOINT IS FILLING UP: If they keep coming
in as they have been these past few months, where
are they going to put them? The prison has room
for approximately 900 men, including the segrega-
tion and new men’s section. The count is far over
that figure now—and every week men are being
transferred. The problem is easy to solve—just give
more men paroles. Surely, there are many men in
here who are deserving of being granted a parole
who were previously denied one.

of law and justice in erime annals took place in
England and was known as “Trial By Battle.’’ In
