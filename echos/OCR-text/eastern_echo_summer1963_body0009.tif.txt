Through a Glass -

IDS have been explored. Sinful souls researched
and staked out. Dreadful deeds have been scrupu-
lously depicted, analyzed and served up in weighty
tomes and histories. To date, none of the intelligence
culled from all this revealment has been able to
smash the glass darkly through which men convicted
of crimes are steadfastly seen by society in general,
and correctional omnipotents in particular.

Prisoners travel up and down penal circuits turn-
ing themselves inside out attempting to fit some
fuzzy, rehabilitative rationale; and in truth, as a
means of winning freedom, all that twisting and turn-
ing about is as efficacious as spitting in the wind.
Those who decide prisoners’ destinies ceased long
ago to believe sincerely that a system so thoroughly
crude in its approach to behaviorism has any com-
petence in inducing tractability in men living under
it. Such anxious little goodies as commutes and pa-
roles are dispensed in manners wholly irrelevant to
anything that happens in a man’s life—good or bad

lawful and the lawless, too many behavioral doors
must be passed through to uncover a cache of pre-
dictable, fundamental, characteristics common to the
just against which the unjust may be measured.

Let us not beat around the bush. Correction in
theory is scientifically insupportable, and in practice
incapable of delivering. Unless the purveyors of
the correctional syndrome are prepared to deal di-
rectly with major behavioral dynamics, that is to say,

to make neurological changes in the physiological ap-

hear no more about correction in theory.

As everyone knows these days, the human person-
ality is an incredibly complex blending of many ele-
ments, all aspects of which may be engaged by no
single act, however often repeated. A prisoner like
everyone else is many things, and, in most cases, the
least part of what he is, is revealed in his crime.
Despite all the hue and cry regarding the inherent
brutality of men charged with homicide, for ex-
ample, these men constitute the gentlemen of prison
society. They are the most tractable, least bother-
some, best adjusted of the prison body. Any warden
worth his badge will testify to this. For the answers
to why and how men are catapulted beyond the
