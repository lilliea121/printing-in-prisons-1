On February 8th, of this year a sports banquet was
held in the Chapel-Auditorium, in behalf of the
athletic program and those athletes who had been
outstanding in their particular field of sports. Each
year this affair is held and enjoyed immensely by
those of us who are picked as contributing, or being
a beacon for others to see and follow in our footsteps,
as we have in the past seasons.

This reporter arrived somewhat late. Upon my
arrival I was greeted by the sounds of singing and
moaning guitars. There stood three fellows Donald
\“Caleutta” Dietz, Edward Finnacle, and “Red”
Martin, who were putting their every effort into a
“Hillbilly” sound called “Mountain Dew.” Neverthe-
less they did a fine job of entertaining us until the
honored guests arrived. Then we all had the pleasure
of meeting some wonderful men in the world of
sports, such as:

the sweet and unsweetened humor, with which he so
aptly floored us. I firmly beleve that this gentleman
is In the wrong field of announcing. His succulent
tid bits were eagerly digested by us all. Many of the
fellows applauded him long after the banquet was
over, for it was fitting to be sure. Wherever you are
Mr. Byron, please return very soon sir; we love you
very much, for you are so rare among men.

Mr. Sweeney was next introduced as a former
fighter and sportsman in the Pennsylvania area for a
number of years. He defended himself like a champ
when someone asked him about the decision between
Joey Giardello and Henry Hank. The details he gave
were serious to some degree and rather humorous in
other ways. Being the referee for that fight made
him unpopular with many of the fight fans. He
scored the fight for Giardello by a close margin,
when the majority of the fans had Hank the winner

Our toastmaster for the evening, Pete Byron, a
very astute one, not to mention his witty ways of
keeping the audience on the tips of their seats with

on their score cards. After the fight people ques-
tioned him about his decision, some were not even at
the bout, he would ask them if they were, if not he
would say “I was.” It was such an uproarious thing
to hear him explain some of the action of this par-
ticular bout. Another funny thing he said, “My own
wite wouldn't speak to me after that, I believe her
money was on Hanks.” This to say the least, knocked
us out. That one shook the house of worship to the
rafters. During the course of his speaking he went
on to relate the period in which he had done his box-
ing and gave forth many exciting accounts thereof.
This was greatly enjoyed by one and all beyond
doubt. From my observation of Mr. Sweeney, he ap-
peared to be in splendid physical condition after the
hectic fighting career in the ring. It proved he got
out in time.

Previous to Mr. Sweeney’s story on the podium,
Mr. Frank Dolson, sports writer for the Philadelphia
Inguirer, held a question and answer period with the
