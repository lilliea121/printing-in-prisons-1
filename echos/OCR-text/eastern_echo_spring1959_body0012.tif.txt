Classification’s Stuttering Combination:

Testers to Staffers t Chance

xpert classification of inmates upon reception

EK, into state penitentiaries has been highly pub-

licized as one of the prime features set forth

in the reorganization plans of many penal systems.

Information bulletins and manuals detailed the oper-

ations of the newly staffed “Diagnostic and Classi-
fication Clinics.”

In the typical clinic at the standard Penitentiary
four men (two psychologists and two social workers)
conduct the major portion of the initial processing
of the receptees who enter the clinic at an average
rate of 25 per week. Such processing includes a
thorough investigation of the inmate’s background
(social, military, and criminal) by contacts between
the social workers and various assisting agencies.

This information becomes a part of the man’s
record file, as do the results of the personal inter-
views and tests conducted by the psychologists of the
elinic. The depth of this psychological examination
is attested to by the range of tests to which he may
be submitted. Scovill, Rorshach, Thematic Apper-
ception Test, Draw-a-House-Tree-Person-Test, Minn-
esota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, and others.

The findings of the clinic staff are augmented
by the further reports of institutional staff members
such as the Educational Director, Vocational Direct-
or, and Medical Director, who have also interviewed
the prisoner during this period.

No fault can be found with the thoroughness or

value of the results obtained through the conscien-
tious efforts of the above mentioned staff members,
who despite an ever increasing workload are largely
successful in carrying out their duties as set forth in
the manuals. Yet one often hears the claim that the
present systems of classification are lacking, or worse
yet—failures! This opinion is not held solely by in-
mates, who are expected to find fault with anything
connected with prisons, but is shared by a nuinher of
those members of free Society who have yet to wit-
ness evidence of progress. However, the frankness
of their disagreement with the present systems of
classification is sufficient cause for a closer look into
the situation.

To substantiate the claim that classification, as
presently conceived, is not an asset to the generally
improved program initiated by the reorganization
of 1954, the following factors are often presented as
evidence that the system is falling short of its pur-
pose.

It is generally agreed that classification exists
to serve two main functions. Essentially of import-
ance only to the custodial officials in charge of se-
