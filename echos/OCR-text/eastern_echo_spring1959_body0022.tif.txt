Tae, BEES

wore. For a moment he studied the print-marked
earth of the high road, then spoke in a snarled fury,
“You lie, buffoon! Search him men!”

Two of the bandits dismounted, pulled Sidi
down with a great clatter.

“Quiet, you fools!” hissed Surama. “The bees. . .”

In silence, the box of white powder found on the
servant was handed to the chief.

“Hever medicine, O’, Surama,” pleaded Sidi.
“Memsahib have bad fever. Medicine good for fever.
Plenty cheap, too.”

Surama examined the white powder, smelled
it, tasted it. “Fever medicine, perhaps. Morphine
certainly. Not cheap, liar. Worth many thousand
rupees.”

The little servant’s eyes rolled. What could he
do? He looked up at the grim chieftain and into the
pitiless eyes.

“Surama, without the medicine, Memsahib will
die.”

“You lie again. Your Master and Memsahib
are not out of reach. Dog and son of a dog, I will
spare your life if you tell me the truth ... Must we
ride hard or not to overtake them before they reach
Nagpur? The truth, dog!”

Sidi hesitated briefly. He realized the chief
surmised the man and woman were waiting for their
servant to bring the medicine. But Surama could
not know how close they were.

“Surama,” said Sidi, “to overtake them before
they reach Nagpur, you must ride fast, very fast.
Your horses will suffer, perhaps die. Very hot. Be-
sides,” Sidi added, ‘Should you overtake them, you
will have trouble. Sahib is well armed with high-
- powered rifle and revolver too.”

Sidi watched the grizzled chieftain closely. The
others did not matter. Surama’s decision would pre-
vail. And Sidi knew the bandits would ride. They
had nothing to lose except a horse or a man, or two.
They would first kill him, Sidi, for these modern
thugs of today’s India, like the by-gone century’s
Thugees, left no one with knowledge among the
living. The little servant knew he had only a while
longer to live, only a little while to do what he
must do.

“O’, Surama,” he said, bowing low twice, “Sidi

erateful, if you spare his life. See, I make you pres-
ent of magic stick.” Sidi drew the heavy weapon
from his sash. ‘Look, see, O’ Surama, how good is
this magie wood, Watch!”

Sidi hurled the big boomerang. It sailed swiftly
through the air, rose in a graceful sweep, turned
and sailed back toward the group. It dipped neatly
under the spreading limbs of the fig tree and came to
rest at the servant’s feet.

One of the dismounted robbers, wonder in his
greedy eyes, went toward it.

“Wait!” Sidi said, picking up the curved stick.
“Look now!” He pointed above, to a lazy kite bird
not too far away. A smooth motion of his sturdy
arm and the boomerang flew in a sharp upward
swoop and met the kite with neck-snapping impact.
As Sidi retrieved the weapon, he heard, over the
noisy gabble of the excited bandits, the ominous
drone of the bees which have no liking for the scent
or sound of man.

Back under the fig tree, Sidi looked up at Sura-
ma with an enigmatic smile. Then he looked down
at the beloved boomerang in his hands, rubbed it
all over affectionately, then flung it with all his
strength and skill, right down into the ravine. The
stick dropped sheer, angled flatly, skimmed swiftly
across the wide chasm, whirled upward with amaz-
ing speed, straight for the deadly bees. The ban-
dits froze with stunned reaction as the magic stick
crashed through one, two, three of the huge papery
nests. Surama roared like a Bengal tiger. His knife
flew through the air and lodged in Sidi’s side. The
little servant fell mortally wounded. The last sound
in his ears was the fury of a quarter-million killer
bees. Surama and his gang fled, but the swift bees,
following the hated man-scent along the path of the
violating boomerang, quickly overcame the fleeing
group. The air was filled with the screams of men
and animals and echoed from the arid hills of Maha
Dayo. Then, nothing more was to be heard except
the persistent drone of the bees.

Two hours past sundown, Stephen Gaylord
stared once more down the long road. Then he
turned and looked at his wife across the embers of
a small fire. “Sandra, I don’t think Sidi is coming
back. We’ll go on to Nagpur.”

Sandra tossed her long black hair, to mask her
exultation. In the red glow of the embers. Sandra
looked like someone out of the old testament.

“I’m glad, Stephen. Much as I need the medi-
cine, ’m glad he is not coming back. I never trusted
him, you know.” — THE END
