gun, too. Did you ever see a big gun, Santa?”

“Huh? Oh. . . of course not,” answered Harry,
wiping his suddenly sweating brow. He thought for
a moment. “Do you know what room the money’s in,
kid?”

“Sure, it’s right next door. Right through that
wall there.” The boy sprang to his feet. “T’ll bet if I
kieked on the wall, Daddy would hear me.”

Harry snatched the kid away from the vicinity
of the wall. ‘Hold it, boy. We don’t want to disturb
your father while he’s playing flatfoot, do we?”

“Do you have TV in the North Pole, Santa?”
asked the boy.

_“What’s that got to do with the subject?” asked
elevignaye

The boy laughed. “I don’t know, but you talk
like the TV sometimes.”

Harry didn’t bother with an answer. He was
busy thinking. Somebody had gotten wind that
something was going to be pulled off. Right now the
jerk who had introduced him to this whole deal was
probably sitting in some cooler. The jerk had prob-
abbly talked his head off, and to catch him in the act
a store detective was perched right in the room with
the dough. Probably had his gun pointed right at

the wall waiting for Harry to poke his head through
for a target.

No, Harry decided, he couldn’t afford to satisfy
his sense of curiousity under such confining cireum-
stances. The deal was definitely off. The sooner he
got rid of this monkey-suit and serammed, the better
off Mrs. Garnet’s little boy would be.

“O.K., kid, you’d better get along now,” he said.
“Tl see you Christmas.”

Having extracted this promise, the boy left the
room. Afterward the floor manager informed the
personnel department that Santa Claus had disap-
peared. He had left behind only a rather cryptic note
stating that he had departed for the North Pole
where the climate was healthier.

Thus, there was no grand larceny committed at
Lacy’s Department Store that Christmas week. How-
ever, in the rush and excitement of the Xmas season,
a large, deluxe model bicycle was somehow misplaced
and never found again.

P.S.—It wasn’t noised about, but one of Lacy’s
store detectives was later embarrassed when his boy
found a similar bike on the front porch on Christmas
morning. How could he any longer deny the exis-
tence of a real Santa Claus?

CANINE:

Felix, why is your fur so bright?

Why do your eyes glow at night?

If that is all, then I’ll be on my way.

CANINE:

Why do you climb way up in a loft?

Why do you meow when the moon is full?
Why in the summer do you look so cool?

FELIX:

Whye Why? Why? Is that all you can say?

Why do you constantly wash your face?

FELIX:

CANINE:

Felix, why do they pet you so much?
Why do you play with all that you touch?
Why ‘do you have nine chances to die?
Why do you think you're better than |?

FELIX:

Why? Whye Why? Is that all for Today?
If that is all, then I’ve something to say:

You ask me these secrets with envy and greed,
Secrets for which you'll never have need.

For if you were like | with no exceptions,
There‘d be no need for your stupid questions.
