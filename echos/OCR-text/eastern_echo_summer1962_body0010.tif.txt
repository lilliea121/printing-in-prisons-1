Changing the conversation, Dr. Teeters observed
that present penal systems were as old-fashioned
Model T Fords fitted out with some new and modern
parts, but the new parts are not enough. Exploding
a current myth, he disclosed that the institution with
fine athletic facilities, good library, clean modern
appointments, with the accent on Instructors and the
teaching of trades... still may be a failure. Dr. Teet-
ers believes that the sports, libraries and trades are
all good things, but that they can be overdone. Good
in their own way, they can become mere ‘time-kill-
ers, pleasant ways of doing time, but the personal,
individual problem of each inmate can be forgetten.
Surprising as it may be, most trades learned in pris-
ons are not used by the prisoners once they are re-
leased. A possible solution, the professor said, would
be to de-emphasize the Instructors of trades some-
what and put the money and time into experienced
Case Workers. It seems that most modern Psycholo-
gists, etc., believe that at some time during his in-
carceration an inmate reaches his highest potential
for rehabilitation, and that if released at this time
he would be the best risk to himself and to society at
large. If this “time passes, without his being re-
leased, the prisoner slowly deteriorates and becomes
a menace to himself and to society. Teeters con-
tended that a trained Case Worker is best suited to
help the man reach that high peak of awareness as
to the cause of his being in prison, and to weigh the
wispy intangibles and determine that “‘time’’of high-
est return.

A Staff member asked the Professor what an in-
mate could do to help himself while in prison.
“Think! Think! Think!’ was the reply. ““And then
think some more. Ultimately ,you must solve your
own problem... from within. It is difficult to think,
and easy to alibi, but you must see past the alibi,
identify your problem, and solve it. Treatment staff

yourself and to be helped!”’

Asked about the possibility of other meetings of
this type, Dr. Teeters offered to try to arrange meet-
student criminologists and varied

ings between

groups of inmates. He feels that everyone would
profit. The professor said he would also try to set
up debates between university and inmate teams on
points of mutual interest... but first he would try to
arrange to have some debating experts help estab-
lish debating teams here. He would also look into

the possibilities of a class in journalism.

Speaking about the institution, Dr. Teeters com-

appointment of a Commissioner of Correction and
the creation within this institution of the Eastern Di-
agnostic Classification Center, with the modern re-
gime here, were big steps forward. Evincing his in-
terest in the historical aspects of this prison, he said
that he has been coming here for about 27 years and
that this was the first time he was allowed to talk to
the inmates themselves. Thus this meeting was a
minute of history on the historical clock of the insti-
tution. Seen against the backdrop of the old regime
. it would not have happened.

Perhaps the writer was unduly impressed by the
eye-opening meeting, but after years of seeing the
prisoners treated as political pawns, no-caste citizens,
and the targets of anyone with the need of an un-
answering target, it was refreshing indeed to talk
with someone from free society who could see the
prisoner's side as well as the public’s. The oddly—
illuminating ideas of the famed criminologist, his fac-
ulty of seeing beyond the usual, and his advanced
theories backed up with logic and vision, were like
a fresh breeze lifting a veil on the old theories that

have failed.

“On the other hand, if the society can be sufficiently objective and understanding in
not having to burn psychotics as witches cr punish offenders as criminals; if the society can
express its aggressions through football, boxing, politics, and TV stories; then the prison
can assume its function of treating the socially ill with the best methods of which we are

aware.”’
