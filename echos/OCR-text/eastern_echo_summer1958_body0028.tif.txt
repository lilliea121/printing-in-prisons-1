HATS OFF TO THE PRINT SHOP GANG

SNOOPY has to take his high hat off and ex-
tend his paw to the print shop crew for their fine
work in getting THE ECHO out. Among those re-
sponsible for such a fine job are: Linotype operators
TOM FLANNERY, LITTLE OBIE, PAUL NEAL,
and ED SOUTHARD. Pressmen JOE McNULTY,
VINNIE COLODONATO, MIKE HUDAK, AL
RADE and PAUL PERRY. A special accolade to
the above mentioned for their fine cooperation.

ECHO PRESENTS THE ECHO’S

A newly formed little band, the “KCHO’S”’ is
rapidly becoming a habit with followers of slow,
captivating rhythms. The ECHO’S have a new and
fresh approach in dance music. Intricate and
unique tones hold the listener spellbound as they
play each week-end in the staff room. Members of
this interesting little band are; FREDDY ADAMS,
Ist tenor and leader; ‘“‘BARON’ HINKUEH, alto and
clarinet; PAUL GOFF, trombone; ARTY COUTS,
4th tenor; BOBBY JOHNSON, trumpet; EARL
BROWN, drums; ‘SKINNY’ DYER, accordion;
JIMMY MOSS, guitar; and JACK MACH, bass.

A MUSICAL ECHO

If any of you fellows are wondering what the
Strange sounds are emitting from the ECHO office,
during the A.M. hours, it’s only AUGUSTUS WES-
LEY JR. 3rd, better known as ‘JUNEBUG’, playing

26

his left handed guitar along with his favorite ‘Rock
‘n Roll’ radio program.

DUKE’S COUNTRY BOY’S

Leader BUD DUKE on guitar; JOKE HOFFMAN,
mandolin LEONARD ‘‘TENNESSEE’’ MAHOF-
FRY, guitar and JOHN “ELVIS” JASON, voealist,
making real country music. This is a real hill-billy
group with the pro touch, harmonizing the folk songs
of the land, ballads of longing and hunger for man’s
eternal search for love. Lively, foot tapping songs of
down home and of course, ‘rock ’n roll’, as only
hill-bilies can deliver them.

OF SIGHTS AND SOUNDS:

The velvet tone of the flute as played by JESSH
BURCH, it seems as tho he were pulling notes like
taffy into a thin sweet thread of sound ... The
voices of the Catholic Choir, and the Choir directed
by “BUD”’ HARDY of the Salvation Army, as they
sing for Sunday Service... The smile on Joe’s face
as he walks to the visiting room to see his wife Sally,
Son Joey, and daughter Jo Ann. . . Men, as restless
as a chipmonk’s tail, sitting, waiting to be called to
be interviewed by the Parole Board. .. You cannot
fail to appreciate the warm, congenial atmosphere
which surrounds Alphonso LaRue, Herb Elliott and
Pencil’ Willie’. . Cisco Cisneros says, 2 WVihy,
look back, look to the future, the whole world is be-
fore you.’’
