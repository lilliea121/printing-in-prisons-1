Felix John Capone

A Proféde by L. J, Biancone

(Former PPA Correspondent)

Every two weeks an elderly lady goes to the East-
ern State Correctional Institution at 21st street and
Fairmount Avenue to visit a 32-year-old prisoner
who ran afoul of the law at the age of 16.

Felix John Capone, the subject of these bi-weekly
excursions—over a span of some 16 years——may
still be a young teenager in the fancy of his widowed
mother’s eye, but in point of reality, he is a mature
man who has acquired a deeper understanding of
himself and others, and thereby broadened his own
horizons under the most adverse circumstances. To
most men many years his senior, the steel gates of
doom seemingly clang shut behind them with an om-
inous sound of finality. Not so for Felix John. Yet,
his burden is as heavy, if not heavier, than theirs.
You see, he’s a lifer. And but for his captive world,
he knows no other as an adult. The world of his
childhood—and the subjects of his childish dreams
—remain as mere memories abbreviated with
horror.

The world of his childhood came to an abrupt
and tragic end when Felix and three other youths,
all several years older than himself, embarked on a
short-lived crime spree in the winter of 1947, when
the quartet undertook to stage an armed robbery of
a tavern. Felix was unarmed, however, and chose
to remain in a car parked nearby, while his confeder-
ates perpetrated the robbery.

As they boarded the waiting car to flee the scene
of the crime, one of the armed trio fired two aimless
shots into the darkness of the night, in a parting ges-

ture reminiscent of the wild west. Unfortunately,
one of the seemingly harmless shots struck and
killed a pedestrian nearly half a block away.

Felix, as part and parcel of the criminal episode,
was convicted of first degree murder and sentenced
to life imprisonment on the legal theory that his par-
ticipation—under Pennsylvania law—was a ‘‘proxi-
mate consequence’ of his felonious adventure, even
though the act which killed was the act of another.
His confederates were likewise convicted, but the
penalty was fixed at death. Eventually, however,
their sentences were commuted to life imprisonment
by executive clemency.

Prisons nowhere, of course, have approached the
ideal as it exists in Samuel Butler's fabled land of
Erewhon— of treating felons as sick men come to a
hospital. But in the use of new methods and indi-
vidual approaches, considerable progress has been
made toward the ideal of curing prisoners of their
ills and remaking their personalities.

Felix John is a classical case history in point.
Upon his commitment to the penitentiary, he was
routinely interviewed by the chaplain of his faith.
With appropriate rapport, in due time his religious
background and other interests were explored. No
miracles were performed, none were claimed. But
like all men wrought with anguish and remorse, he
was in need of spiritual guidance and got it—reg-
ularly.

Today, some |6 years later, Felix is a mature man
with deep religious convictions. He not only attends
