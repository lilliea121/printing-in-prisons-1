pressions of opinion as to the merits of the applica-
tion; and to the Board of Parole for its investigation.

Thus, at the time of the hearing the Board should
have available to it the following information re-
garding the applicant:

“A. A summary of the investigation by an agent of
the Parole Board, made 4 to 8 weeks prior to the hear-
ing. This summary includes: (1) the parole plan with
the applicant’s home, job, and sponsor; (2) reputation
of the applicant; (3) comments of the judge and dis-
trict attorney on the merits of the application; (4) the
facts of the crime from notes of testimony; (5) any dis-
crepancies between what the applicant has stated in the
application and what appears from court testimony; (6)
the applicant’s prior criminal record, if any; (7) a list
of accomplices, sentences, places of confinement, if any.
“B. Commutation summary prepared by the staff of
the penitentiary where the applicant is confined. This
includes: (1) general information such as age, place of
birth, race, marital status, intelligence rating; (2) the
current case, such as term and number of indictment,
name of trial judge, date of sentence, effective date of
sentence, the sentence, and time served; (3) detainers,
if any; (4) previous arrests, previous convictions, pro-
bation and parole violations, if any; (5) the institution-
al report, including conduct report, vocational report,
educational, medical psychological and psychiatric re-
ports, money savings, a summary of the applicant’s
progress in the institution, the staff estimate of his
worthiness, his classification summary, the applicant’s
version of his crime compared to the official version, his
family background, the economic and social status of
his father and mother, the names and addresses of sib-
lings, their employment and marital status, the personal
history of the applicant (youth, school, illnesses, travel,
recreational interests, military history, employme.c his-
tory, religious affiliation), his mental rating, mechanical
tests, a general impression of his personality make-up
and sources of all the above information.

“C. Letters from trial judges, district attorneys, and
others. A copy of all letters of protest from relatives
of the victim or others interested in preventing the re-
lease of the applicant.

“D. Picture of the applicant.

“E. A confidential report from the prison staff regard-

ing the merits of the applicant.’’

In general, the application for commutation and
its contents is available to the Board of Pardons for
their study several days before the opening hearing.
The Board conducts hearings during ten months of
each year, and an application is generally acted upon
and presented to the Governor for his consideration
within two months after the hearing of the case.

All hearings are public and are held either in Har-
risburg at the State Capitol Building, in Philadelphia
at the State Office Building, or in Pittsburgh at the
City-County Building, except that upon due notice
hearings may be held in such other places as the
Board may designate. When John Doe's case is
heard, fifteen minutes will be allowed to his repre-

14

sentative (relative, friend, or attorney) to speak for
him in front of the Board members. In case he does
not have any such persons available to represent him,
the Director of Parole, after a personal interview
with the applicant, will speak for him at the hearing,
as well as present the facts of the case as taken from
the institutional summary.

The Board may also request any person, includ-
ing a present or former district attorney and any
official, to appear at the public hearing as a witness
in addition to other persons voluntarily arguing for
or against the prisoner's application.

Although fifteen minutes is allowed each side to
present their case for or against the application, in
practice it has been found that a layman or parole
officer arguing on behalf of the prisoner usually takes
about two or three minutes to present his case; a
minister or lawyer, or a district attorney opposing
the application uses approximately five minutes.

The Board has all public hearings transcribed and
filed with the Secretary of the Board of Pardons.
The transcript of the hearing is then open for inspec-
tion by the applicant or his representative and by
the public.

After the public hearing an executive session is
held during which the participating Board members
come to final decision regarding the recommendation
they shall make to the Governor. Three votes in fav-
or of an application for clemency are necessary be-
fore the Board can recommend favorable action by
the Governor. If such is reeommended, it is accom-
panied by a statement of the Board's reasons for its
recommendation.

The Governor may approve or disapprove of the
Board’s favorable recommendation. When the notice
of his action is received by the Secretary of the Board
of Pardons, the Secretary makes public announce-
ment of the Board’s and Governor’s action as soon
as practicable. If the Governor approves of the
Board's favorable recommendation, John Doe re-
ceives a Warrant of Commutation with the Gov-
ernor’s signature and the Seal of the Commonwealth.
This ends his connections with the procedures of the
Board of Pardons, and he is now eligible to appear
in front of the Parole Board.

The Parole Board may or may not release John
Doe after due examination of his case. However,
usual practice has dictated that the Board of Parole
accept the rather thorough investigation and sub-
sequent recommendation of the Board of Pardons,
and that they release the man on parole.
