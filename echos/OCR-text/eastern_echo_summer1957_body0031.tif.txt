Before my barred and gramte window

I stood wrapped in sorrow deep

Before my barred and gramte window
I contemplated eternal sleep

Restlessly I sought the courage
Before my barred and granite sill
To end my torment, end my sorrow
One last look to last until ......

Suddenly a brilliant flashing
Int my cubicle as day
Momentarily exposing .....
Skies of dark and dismal gray

Reverberating, deafening thunder
Swelling winds that moaned and hummed
Inke an wnstrument of heaven

Swift and violently strummed

Tortured trees, defenceless, writhing
Just as I in helpless woe

Limbs atwist, angushed, pleading
In agony swayed to and fro

Long I stood before my window
Transfixed by scenes that awed my soul.
In my heart a storm was raging
Pounding drums that pitched and rolled

Raindrops hurled m maddened fury

A mighty tempest rode its peak
Through my barred and granite window
I witnessed God in heaven speak

Silently there came the dawning
With it sweet and soothing rest
Ravished trees stood imp and weary
Having ’dured the strictest test

Before my barred and granite window
I knelt there wm enrapt release

Inke the storm my doubts were over
Alas! my heart had found its peace

Autumn Leaves
by HARRY W. JOHNSON

Autumn leaves, tinted by the breath
of the Creator, make only brief 1m-
pressions upon the mind of the viewer
.... but the truth of ther ex-
istence and the depth of their beauty
are engraved upon the altar of the
soul eternally ... And like those
autumn leaves, a gift from the heart
is a treasure of such value that only
the soul can estimate the worth and
appreciate the depth of tts beauty.

Mistakes
by THOMAS WILLIAMS

No life ts barren of mistakes
No heart devoid of pain
The point is shall our efforts be
Ne’er stumble so again
We have our senses, heart and soul
But strength we must atian
To battle weakness, tooth and nail
Nor, make that err agan
Perhaps at times we falter in,
the everlasting fight
Yet af the mind is willing, we
keep our goal wn sight
To say that we are sorry is
a flimsy thing indeed
Still it is a beginmng toward,
that humility we need.
