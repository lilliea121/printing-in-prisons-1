feat in three games (Bernard Harris,
Matthew Smith and Leon Gardner).
Joseph Antoniewicz turned a_ losing
game into a win when Martin Pearson
failed to make the moves necessary to

secure the win.

The biggest surprise has been the
play of Leon Gardner, a C Major play-
er. Leon goes into the 10th round with
a 7-2 record, which is remarkable be-
cause every week he has been matched
against expert, A and B Class players.
Regardless of whatever final standing
he achieves at the completion of the
tournament he is to be congratulated

for his great play.

Other players have also shown great
improvement in their play in past
tournaments, notably: Neville Bridget
(D Class), William Barnes (D Class),
James Ryder (D Class), John Lees
(C Minor), Arthur Bruno (C Minor),
Clarence Washington (C Minor), John

Anderson (C Major), John Zerah
(C Major) and Matthew Smith

INDUSTRIAL LEAGUE
The ESP Chess Club, piling up five

straight victories, lead the Industrial
League at the halfway mark. Making a
strong bid for the Championship of this
league the club has posted decisive
scores over Philadelphia Electric (314-
14 and 4144-4), Chester Pike (3-2),
Blue Cross (4-1) and the Defense In-
dustry Supply Center (314-114).

The crucial match was with Chester

named it “‘the match of blunders.’ Both
teams were very tense with emotions at

(a) The Sicilian Defense is the
most popular opening against P-K4. Its
strong points are the half open Bishop
file, early freedom for the Queen and a
choice of pawn formations. Its greatest
drawback is that White may easily gain
and_ break

through with a winning attack in the

control of the Center

opening or middle game. Usually an
ending will favor Black.

(b) This is the modern version of
the Dragon Variation. In the older
method of the Dragon (2 .. . N-QB3
instead of P-Q3) Black had to contend
with the much feared Richter-Rauzer
Attack. The latest method of getting
to the Dragon with 2 . . . N-KB3 is as
follows: 1. P-K4, P-QB4; 2. N-KB3,
N-@B3)73) B-O4) Px. 4.N=Pae ib WN
(the Accelerated Fianchetto), followed
with B-N2, N-KB3, 0-0, Q-R4 and
N-KN5. This of course permits White
to play the Maroczy Bind which was
once considered to be the refutation of
the Sicilian. Today this no longer holds

true.

(c) B-N3 is the accepted move. At
N3 the Bishop puts pressure of Q5, K6
and B-7. It also helps to prevent P-Q4
which is one of Black’s main goals. The
Q5 square is an important square to
White and he will try to post a Knight
there to assist in an attack on the King
side and on occasion the Queen side as
well. In this particular variation that
White is employing, he usually Castles
Queen side and then institutes an attack
on the King wing by steam-rolling his
pawns. However, in the game under
discussion most of the play occurs in
the Center and the Queen side.

(d) An immediate P-K3, followed
by B-N2 and P-Q4 would have given
Black a good game.

(e) If Black had played P-K3 on
his I 1th move, White could not have
followed through with the manueveur
employed here. e.g. I] . . . P-K3 in-
stead of BeN2Z. 12. B=Nd, P-B3! and
Black wins a piece. Now P-K3 would
lose to NxKP.

(£f) Why didn’t White simply play
BxR?

(g) This is why. White threatens
N-K6 followed by Q-N7 mate.

(h) Q-K2 would be better and in
all probability would have held the

postion.

(Gi) With Q-N6 White must win a
piece regardless of how Black con-

tinues.

G) IE BO oo o RSdetelng B IRSIR, Ooxlp
22. QxNch and White would be a piece .
to the good. Black must move the Rook
as White threatened RxR mate.

(k) Black must be very careful
now. With his last move he has danger-
ously exposed his King and with both
the King and Queen on the same rank
he must beware of a pin or a double
attack.
