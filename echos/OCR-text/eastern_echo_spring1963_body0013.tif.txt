Through a window in the wall (The Eastern Echo), we are presenting
Walter Gala, Inmate Nurse, not as we think he should be, but as he had pre-
sented himself over a period of fourteen years. His achievements have been
of his own doing, and his efforts have been constantly directed toward the day
that he can become a productive and useful citizen. Like many others here, he
has hopes that by showing what he can accomplish if given the chance, the
chance might be given.

Walter is not the type to simply vegetate or ‘‘mark-time’’ while in prison;
instead, he has made constructive use of his time. He has a commendable, al-
truistic attitude toward his work, consisting of many and varied hospital duties,
which he has performed so well for over nine years. A hard worker, he has prov-
en his stability as well as his loyalty, by staying on the job and making himself
available whenever he was needed. This in itself is indicative that he has met
the challenge of society to justify his request for acceptance.

Through the window in the wall, you will understand that we of the
“Echo” staff are guilty of slanting our material to represent the best of us and
our side of the case. However, in Walter Gala’s case we do not believe that any
truth is lost by doing so, since our readership consists of that small minority of
society directly interested and qualified to judge for themselves the worthiness
of these facts and opinions. The uninterested majority, never seeing or hearing
any dissenting opinions, naturally accepts the views of a sometimes even more
prejudiced free press or commentator.

The following commendation is taken verbatum from a letter received by

Walter Gala:

SUBJECT: Commendation DATE:

Superintendent, E.S.P.

I wish personally to commend you for the excellent service that
you rendered in taking care of the patients during the recent virus
epidemic which was prevalent in this institution.

The Medical Director has informed me that you worked way
beyond the call of duty in this work. We gained much experience on
this and through your untiring efforts were able to avert a serious
epidemic.

This shall be made part of your record and you are free to show
this to the staff when you are considered for parole or commutation.

Walter also holds a special letter of commendation from Dr. I.H. Sokolic,
F.A.C.S. Adjunct, Dept. of Surgery, Albert Einstein Medica! Center, for assist-
ing in carrying out research in the Atom Bomb radiation flash burns, which was
sponsored in part by both the U.S. Army and Navy De- (Cont'd on Page 26)
