test was useless in the face of such force. Having
reached this decision, the villagers found themselves
in a quandary; for mingled with the fear of losing
their homes was a fear of a different kind. The
fear that their home would not be found suitable for
occupancy by the enemy which would result in a loss
of face in front of their neighbors. It was the lot-
tery in which those who were selected were both the
winners and the losers. With the natural pride of
possession, each was certain that as soon as the man
with the silver buttons saw their home, he would
want it for himself and they would have proven
their superiority in a village where all were equal
in their poverty.

Even Ichiguro, the old widower with no sons,
felt that this was his last opportunity to regain his
lost stature as a wise and capable man to be respect-
ed by others. His wife having died long ago with-
out leaving him any sons, Ichiguro had labored in
his tiny rice paddy without help and, despite his val-
iant efforts, had slowly lost face as his crop grew
smaller and smaller and his belongings fewer.

His two room shack of waxed-paper and wood
was scorned by the others as being the poorest in the
village. Because of his lonely labor in the field, he
had no time to improve the appearance of his house,
and he had no wife, as did the others, to properly
tend his home. Yet, in his eyes, the little house was
the best in the village and he blamed the jealousy
of his neighbors for their blindness to its beauty.

Afraid to join the others in the street, he squat-
ted on the worn tatami floor and pondered the
question of the cruelty of life and the sweetness of
death. For he was soon to die. The chain of events
had led him into a paradox to which the only answer
was an honorable death. If his house were not cho-
sen, he would have to die to avoid completely losing
face, and if it were chosen, pride would force him to
join his ancestors rather than lower himself and beg
the other villagers for shelter.

So, in his loneliness, he prayed, not to be able to
retain his worthless life, but that his humble home
would be one of the chosen ones, so that he could
die with the knowledge that he had regained his
manhood.

EASTERN ECHO

As the commanding officer strode through the
village inspecting houses, he wrinkled his nose in
disgust. He turned to the lieutenant following him
pone said, ‘‘None of these hovels are any better than
pig-sties, but we’ll have to take the best we can get.
I suppose we can always fumigate them and make
them half-way fit to live in.’

The lieutenant nodded in agreement and said,
‘‘Yes, sir. These people must be really poor. Look
at the way they’ re following us. Almost as if they
were hoping we’d take their houses.’

‘‘Of course! Why shouldn’t they?’’ asked the
colonel. ‘‘The money they will get will support
them for the rest of their lives. Don’t let these pro-
fessors tell you anything about countries having
different codes of living. There’s one code they all
understand and that’s money. Well, I suppose
that’s the lot of them. Send some men down to
post notices on the ones I pointed out. Better find
some way to keep our men out of the worst ones, too.
Heaven knows what diseases they could catch in
some of these places.’’

That afternoon, two MP’s, accompanied by the
Nisei interpreter, tacked dispossession notices on the
doors of the selected homes. They were eagerly a-
waited as they went from door to door, and those
who were passed by lowered their heads to avoid see-
ing the pointed fingers of their more fortunate
neighbors.

One of the MP’s noticed their reaction and com-
mented, ‘‘These sure are a funny people. I’ll never
understand them. Back home when the sheriff
evicted anybody the whole neighborhood raised hell.
These gooks seem to enjoy it. Look at that wrin-
kled old geezer standing in front of that crummy
shack next door. Looks like he’s inviting us in.’’

The interpreter looked and saw Ichiguro as they
passed his home. ‘The old man’s lips were trembling
in excitement and he whispered hoarsely, ‘‘Kudasai,
kudasai?’

‘““What’d he say?’’ asked one of the MP’s.

‘‘He said ‘please’,’’ answered the interpreter.
‘‘He wanted us to take his house.’’

With a laugh, the MP said, ‘‘That dirty shack!
The colonel would throw a fit if we told him we
ecouldn’t find anything better than that.’’

Ichiguro sadly re-entered his house as the sol-
diers went on through the village. His head was
bent in disgrace and shame. Surely, it was a mis-
take. Was not his home the oldest and finest in the
village despite the remarks of his neighbors? He
stared intently at the two rooms. They suddenly
seemed bare and untidy and he realized that he was
truly an old man who was no longer able to distin-
guish the truth with his own eyes. With this thought
he sank slowly and ceremoniously to his knees in
front of the small shrine in the corner of the room
and commenced to make his peace with this world
which had suddenly become chill and cruel.

As the MP’s entered their jeep to leave, a child
came running to them and spoke shyly but rapidly
to the interpreter. The corporal listened and said,
“Wait forme. I’m going tosee whatI cando. The
kid says some old man tried to kill himself.’’
