among people who will have a sincere desire in stim-
ulating him to do good, than could be done in a peni-
tentiary. A moderate term of immurement for an
offender who will have a careful and long parole
supervision when released, is much safer for society,
than if he were given and forced to serve a severely
long sentence, and then released.

If a prisoner is compelled to serve a severely
long sentence after becoming completely rehabilita-
ted, there are possibilities that the inmate may reap-
praise the inconsistencies of rehabilitation and maxi-
mum sentences and when he is released will enter
society with hatred, contempt and revenge, irrespec-
tive of the amount of parole he has remaining or the
consequences involved thereafter. There is nothing
more precarious than an ex-convict loose among so-
ciety possessing such feelings and intentions toward
society. Such attitudes of an ex-convict could be
eliminated considerably, if society would give more
consideration to a prisoner as an individual; permit
more flexibility in a MODERATE sentencing pro-
cedure and affiliate punishment more closely with
rehabilitation. When such things as this are done,
the advancements in preventing the return of con-
victed parole violators will be exceptionally reward-
ing to everyone concerned.

It must be remembered that every judicial law
which deals with persons charged and convicted of
crime has a dual purpose. Namely, to protect the
community against such persons committing any fur-
ther criminal activity against them, and to try to re-
habilitate them to the fullest extent possible during
their confinement. If severe and improper practices
are used against a person in the legal process, con-
siderable harm will be committed in preventing the
ultimate possibilities of a person becoming rehabili-
tated while in prison. If a prisoner has such a severe
amount of time to serve that he cannot see any fu-
ture hope of release, then he has NO reason nor any
desire for rehabilitation.

If the courts and society are opposed to the re-
lease of a completely rehabilitated prisoner just be-
cause he had only served 6 years of a 10 to 20 year
sentence, then what is the purpose of urging rehabili-
tation to prisoners, especially if the prisoners are not
to receive any consideration for accepting it?

If we are going to have continual preaching on
the subject of rehabilitation, then let’s also have
SOMEONE do SOMETHING in obtaining a sentenc-
ing system which will permit the prisoners who ARE
rehabilitated to be RELEASED in a REASONABLE

amount of time.
