VOCATIONAL

REHABILITATION |

““As you see it, what is likely to be the biggest
problem facing you following your release?’’

This question was asked of 300 inmates of Federal
prisons in Atlanta, Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida.
About half of them replied that their chief problems
would be finding employment and lacking money to
spend.

‘I will have about

$50 upon release and no outside help. Many places re-

As one prisoner explained:

quire two weeks for pay—not counting time seeking
work. This cuts it pretty thin.”’

This article is being written in the belief that many
inmates of the State Correctional Institution at Phila-
delphia may well have similar concerns. It will tell
the mentally or physically handicapped persons in this
institution about a government program that will pre-
pare them for useful work and help them find jobs, if
they are found eligible, after they get out of prison.

The article also will explain howefforts to prepare
disabled prisoners elsewhere in the country are being
accelerated.

Services for handicapped inmates of the State
Correctional Institution at Philadelphia are compara-
tively new. The Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational
Rehabilitation started a special program for former
prisoners at the institution, including those on parole,
last November.

Within this short time about 20 have been sent by
the parole officer to the Pennsylvania rehabilitation
agency for assistance with their disabilities, as well
as with preparation for and help in finding a job.
Among them are paralytics, deformed persons, those
with epilepsy, and some who are mentally retarded.

There already have been some successes. One
man has been placed in a job as door screen packer at
$50 a week, and another man has been provided with a
course in tailoring to prepare him for work in that field.

Another former inmate, who was paroled from the
State Correctional Institution to the care of the Penn-
sylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation, has re-
cently undergone extensive surgery and is receiving in-
tensive physical therapy at the Piersol Rehabilitation
Center of the University of Pennsylvania.

These men have been receiving help under what we
call the State-Federal vocational rehabilitation pro-
gram. ‘The program is not only for disabled prisoners
but for all persons with physical or mental disabil-
ities who need help in preparing them for useful work;
people with speech and hearing disorders, blind per-
sons, those who have suffered from heart disease,
cancer and stroke, those with mental illness, for
example.

The program is a working partnership of the Voca-
tional Rehabilitation Administration in the U.S. De-
partment of Health, Education, and Welfare and the
State rehabilitation agencies. There is an agency in
every State, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the
Virgin Islands, and Guam.

The State agencies provide the actual rehabilita-
tion services. Pennsylvania, for example, has a very
good program. The State led the Nation for the fourth
time in the last six years in numberof persons rehabil-
itated to useful work during the year ended June 30,
1965, with a total of 12,794. President Johnson re-
