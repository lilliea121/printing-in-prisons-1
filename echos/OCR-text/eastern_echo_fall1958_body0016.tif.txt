Analysis...

I’ many states there is at present a wave of con-
cern about crime. It has been on the increase,
although now the peak seems to have been passed.
There is little doubt, however, that. more cases of
anti-social behaviour and crime are brought to pub-
lic notice now than in past years.

The explanation of this in part is that more
cases are reported now and that the police of all
states are more inclined to take notice of violations
of the law both by young people and adults.

If society is to be protected and the individual

‘lawbreaker helped, then we must of necessity un-

derstand something of the causes and background
which have given rise to the particular conduct of
which society properly disapproves. Diagnosis
should precede treatment. The doctor who merely
treats symptoms without attempting to understand
the underlying cause of the condition is a quack or

NEW FRONTIERS OF THINKING:

Prisons today are naturally very different places
from those of fifty years ago. Treatment is gener-
ally less severe. Prisoners are given more varied
and useful work to do and education, athletics and
entertainment all figure in the program of a well-
run modern prison.

But the “humanizing” of prison conditions is
only one aspect of a broader and more significant
change in the whole conception of crime and punish-
ments which the findings of criminology are slowly
bringing about. .

No one, say modern criminologists, inherits
“criminal tendencies,” although people may inherit
some quality which makes it easy for them to be-
come criminals. Crime may show the inability of
the individual to deal with the world he lives in or
the inability of society to provide a decent environ-
ment for all people. Crime is often caused by pov-
erty, over-crowded living conditions, bad associa-
tions and accidental factors such as unemployment.
