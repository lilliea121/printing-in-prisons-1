THE RECOUNT
Canon City, Colorado
Keep em coming, last issue tops.

SHADOWS

Salem, Oregon
I have just finished your spring issue—the
very best to date. Your Editorial ‘““Marshals,
Money and Men,” concerns all of us. I have
seen too many men return who, if they had
had the help you propose, would never re-
turn. |

THE MENARD TIME

Menard, Illinois
I have several of your recent issues here.
With all the good reading in them I find it
hard to single out one article to write about.
I thought your story of finding the old
newspapers in old cell block #1 was very
interesting.

THE FOLSOME OBSERVER
Represa, California

I have been meaning to congratulate you on
the good job you do. I do wish you would
mark each Photo with the photographer’s
name. I have a very selfish reason for ask-
ing. One of your photographers is a friend
of mine.

THE MENTOR
South Walpole, Mass.

Your April issue is full of very good report-
ing. I especially liked “The Do-Gooder.”
My thanks to Paul Benzaquin. “The Last
Ima, Qumee” is, Il eel, 2 wey ienoormain:
article. As a victim of the “Detainer Sys-
tem” I know how it feels to be hounded
around from prison to prison I would like
to see this article reprinted many times.

KILBY SUN

Kilby, Alabama
I have read several items in your recent
issues about your “Plasma Plant.” How
about giving us a complete run-down on it?
I read with interest that you are now offer-
ing a course in typewriter repair in your
school. I envy you the live shows you get to
see.
