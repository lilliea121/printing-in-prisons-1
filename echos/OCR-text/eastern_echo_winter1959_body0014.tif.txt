LITTLE ECHOES

BY HENRY MYERS

fter reading an article of mine, one of my as-
sociate editors observed: “Hank, youre against
thines.”

Now this is true, | am against things. In my
writings this soon becomes evident; so why don't I
do something about it—why don’t I write FOR
thines?

To begin I am a prisoner. I am imprisoned and
imprisonment has never been nor ever will be synon-
ymous with good things.

Yet there are days when I find laughter bub-
bling in my throat and there is a good thing taking
place, for my friends are sharing this moment of
well-being with me, laughing together at the humor
that has touched us.

So, cab I ann to ind a Sool Waimea loelamicl wesc
walls, something to write for, [must not look at the
ereyness of the walls, or the steel that cages me, nor
the miserly bit of blue sky God gives to prisoners.
But rather, look into the eyes of others and let what
is in my heart touch the well-spring of theirs, and
thus a good thing will have come and gone, leaving
its mark upon our minds so we may remember the
eoodness we have known.

T must not look down the corridors of time that
we must walk for this leads to madness; but yet to
remember, even as I walk, that I do not walk alone,
my friends travel the selfsame path with me.

T must look in all the not so obvious places of our
secular existence to see the good about me, to write
BOR it, to relate it to you.

OF TIME

I HAVE SEEN a man, due to be discharged,
take hold of his friend who may never go home, and
for a short while they held each other’s hand. I ‘saw
the panorama of years long past come into their eyes,
the fear and hunger were there in the glisten of an
unshed tear. And the one who must remain smiled
and said: “Good luck, Charley.”

This is good and in a small measure—Holy, too.

A BROKEN LOCK caught my eye while passing
time in aimless stroll. I guess you could say that,
since it was broken, 1t was a bad lock. But to me its
being broken made it a good lock, a lock which could
not lock, and this I felt was a symbol of goodness to
come.

THE DAILY PAPERS have an important niche
in our everyday, pass-a-day life.

While reading “The Publisher Speaks’. by
Ksther Klein, publisher of The Philadelphia Jewish
Times, a small knot of nostalgia and pride welled up
in me. Mrs. Klein wrote: “Our founding Father
towerlng over us is a reassuring sight from our mae-
nificent airport. All the modern facilities and ultra-
new conveniences for air travel add to an impressive
departure, but Lealways faze Wp au sune so tumans
William Penn statue for the final salute.”
