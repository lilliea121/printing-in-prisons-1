The function of the piano is many-sided: harmonic,
rhythmic, melodic, and contrapuntal. Our concern in
this discussion is with the role of the piano as a mem-
ber of the rhythm section, rather than as a melodic
or contrapuntal instrument of the group.

Within this boundary, the piano may be expressed
as the addition of a harmonic dimension to the
rhythmic framework of the bassist and drummer.
This is illustrated in the following diagram:

RHYTHM SECTION
RHYTHMIC HARMONIC
DRUMS - BASS - PIANO
In other words, although the piano is a member of the
rhythm section, it is not basically a rhythm instru-
ment, but is primarily concerned with the harmonic
function of the rhythm section. The bass is a member

of both the rhythmic and harmonic functions of the
section.

The pianist will be faced with three different types
of piano parts: (1) The written chordal part of the
“Stock” arrangement; (2) The written melodic or

rhythmic ‘Fill’ part; (3) Chord symbols. Classically
trained pianists with a good reading ability will not
have too much difficulty in playing the first two types
of piano parts. Howevery, many pianists find them-
selves at a complete loss when faced with the chord
symbol part.

The function of the “Chord Symbol” piano part,
is to point out what may be described as “Harmonic
Rhythm,” (i.e., shows the duration of each chord
within a progression).

When playing chord charts for “fast tempo’ tunes,
the manner in which the part is played depends large-
ly upon the frequency of the chord changes. If one
chord lasts throughout one or more measures it might
be repeated in a simple rhythmic pattern.

A7 | D7 G7

could be played in the one measure pattern: A7 on 1,
A7 on up-beat of 3; D7 on 1, D7 on up-beat of 3;
G7 on |) ete. and:

| AT | D7 | ey,
could be played in a two measure pattern: A7 on |,
A7 on up-beat of 3; A7 on 1, A7 on up-beat of 2; D7
on up-beat of 3; D7 on |, D7 on up-beat of 2; G7 on

1, etc. These one and two measure patterns can be
memorized and used consistently.

Chords which occur two to a measure (i.e., chords
changing on the first and third beats) may also
be played by a pre-set pattern.

A7 D7 Cy ey, If

could be played with the one bar pattern used above:
A7 on |, D7 on up-beat of 3; G7 on 1, C7 on up-beat
