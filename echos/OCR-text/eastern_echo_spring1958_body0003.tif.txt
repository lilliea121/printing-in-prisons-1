Dear Reader:

We invite you to read
along with us as we go
through this issue of
ECHO. We have tried
to make it somewhat
DIFFERENT .. . New
stories . . . New articles

. New authors .
Newsy and informative,
yet gratifying and real

Controversial, yet
not offensive.

Let us begin on P-2,
where Superintendent
Banmiller lists five
plagues that affect hu-
manity. Study number
three carefully, “Hatred
Between Man and Man”

. Cage Two gives us
Gil @iNENVEP 56 5 5 JPH-G,
reveals the human kind-
ness that is within the
heart of one woman, Mrs.
Dorothy Scheer . :-. On
P-7, Charles Shaw, radio
and television news ed-
itor of WCAU, Phila-
delphia, Penna., reveals
his thoughts as quoted
from his radio program,
AS I See 1”

P-12 contains “Behold
the Criminal... Man,
a powerful and thought
provoking article by
SUCPUGRG IB. J OM @C&
A newcomer to HCHO,
Binford H. Smith, P-34,
asks a timely question,
‘What Are You Going
To Do About It?”

In the final analysis,
on P-14, “Echo in Retro-
spect,” we present former
editor, Robert D. Heine-
mann, now Editor Emeri-
Wis IR, ID, ld. nemiens
ECHO from its birth to
its present day and its
acceptance as one of our
foremost Penal Press
Publications. We _ believe
this will be the farewell
meee los IR, ID, Isl.

Humor, pathos, mys-
tery and satire are abun-
dant in stories by new-
comers Cuff, Myers, Hil-
liker and Conrey, along
with veteran ECHO con-
tributor Cressman.

You, the readers, are
the judges of this, our
Spring of ’58 issue.
