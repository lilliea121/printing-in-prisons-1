The only literature which he was permitted to have
was that dealing with religion. It served as a great
counselor and inspirator. It caused him to respect the
meaning of prayer and the need for its employ. Besides
this literature prison chaplains, members of his family,
and the guard on duty, Harry had no contact with the
outside world. As the days passed by, he developed a
strong desire to gain knowledge. The chaplains sup-
plied him with textbooks on various subject. Because
of this, learning and studying became a deep-rooted ap-
petite. The greatest portion of each day was devoted
to studying. Here is a man who has made maturity and
intelligence his newly acquired companions, casting
off immaturity and irresponsipility, which were his com-

panions when he enterea death row!

the chaplains, and from the members of his family. By
the time his sentence was reduced to life, he taught
himself an equivalent of two years of college. There
is no school record showing that he had completed high
school before being incarcerated.

Zietz has been at this institution for over eight
years. [uring those years he has earned high school
and typing diplomas. He has completed one year of
accounting, earning three college credits through Penn-
State University’s Correspondence Instruction Depart-
ment.

Vocationally, Zietz has-done equally well.
over three years he was clerk to Dr. Michael Morello,
former Director of Treatment. This is considered to be
a trusted position for an inmate. He is also a member
of the Chess Club, and he holds a Class-A Pennsy]l-
vania Projectionist’s License. Some years ago
Zietz was classified minimum security and is now as-

signed as an outside trustee here at this institution.

Mental health played a big role in Zietz’s dramatic
life. Even though he believed that this program was
not of his immediate need, he participated it in, never-
theless. Attending individual therapy and completing a
Mental Health Lecture Series, started him on the road to
becoming more interested in developing his personality.

Harry Zietz is—and always has been—an all around

Even professional people knew Zietz Well. Two insti-
tution officials have written very well of his character.
They are Dr. Morello and William J. Banmiller, former
Superintendent. For future possible admission to Brad-

official:
