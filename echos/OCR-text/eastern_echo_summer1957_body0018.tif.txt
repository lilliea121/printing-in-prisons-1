upon the waters unless he’s sure that it will

return in the form of a three-tiered layer cake. If
Shirley Temple was boxing Rocky Marciano, Pete
would not venture a sou upon the match unless he
knew that the fix was in for Shirley to take a dive.

It is also bandied about that Pete can go out
for an evening with a dime, and come back with
nine cents left over. So naturally, when he starts
wooing Gloria Gay, who is appearing nightly
as the feature hip weaver at the ‘‘Chartreuse
Chateaux’’ the smart money lays six to five that
the romance don’t last for two weeks.

Now, Miss Gay is a raven-haired creature with

One night after a particularly torrid session

as she gets her equipment planted in a chair, he
grasps her dainty little mitt with his big bottle
openers, and he says to her like this, ‘‘Gloria baby,
you’re driving me mad. Let’s go see a minister.”’

‘“Why Petey, you mean you want to marry
me?’’ she says, and starts batting her eyelashes
around.

‘You know how I feel about you, hon. How’s
about it?”’

‘‘Oh, Petey,’’ she gurgles, intimating that she
