“To educate men in prison, you must give them
access to the stores of facts which have been gathered
in the past, and place them in conditions which promote
a desire to learn; but you cannot force men into know-
ledge or conduct. The tragedy of prisons has been the
hopeless effort to teach men honesty by breaking their
wills when they would not conform to the tyrannous and
unnatural rules of behavior. What in the name of com-
mon sense can we expect but failure.”

THOMAS MOTT OSBORNE
