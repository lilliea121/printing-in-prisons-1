was crying. Low, wrackling sobs, barely audible,
but haunting . . . disturbing. | listened to her for a
few moments and then went over to her and touch-

ed her shoulder.
“Oh, Keith,’’ She wailed. “Keith, please help

me.’ Then she reached up and pulled me down
next to her and murmured, “Stay with me, Keith.
Don’t leave me. Hold me tight!”’

The next day I shaved off my short tuffed
beard and never went back to the cot again. Some-
how in our long, bitter struggle with our own and
mixed problems, we had found each other, as only
a man and woman who really cared for each other,
could. And so, the long, cold winter passed in
warm blissful harmony.

With the coming of spring, Sybil’s left leg was
about as mended as it would ever be, although it
had a slight crook in it, and was a good half inch
shorter than the right. She limped a little, and when
she tired from time to time | insisted that she use a
walking stick to ease the pressure on the leg.

I didn’t want to rush her into too hasty a trek,
but I was anxious to get her out of the woods so we
could make a fresh start together, somewhere. not
that I was eager to leave my paradise, but I felt
that if my devotion for Sybil was strong enough, I
should be willing to make my sacrifice, no matter
how important it was to me. I would sorely miss

my cabin, my pool and my forest, but | also felt
that I could recover more easily from this loss,
than to give up Sybil. And in deference to her, |
strongly believed that a woman should have the
opportunity to live in an active society.

So, it was during the first week of May that
we started back. Back to what? To the teeming
city of dirt, grime, hate and greed. But back never-
theless. I carried a full pack of essentials, for with
Sybil slowing us down, it would take at least eight
or nine days before we could expect to reach the
nearest farmhouse. We both had shed our buck-
skins and dressed in some of civilian clothes |
had put away soon after my arrival. Right away
I felt uncomfortable and unnatural with the conven-
tional clothing, but we shyly gave Hansel the slip
and took off, with Bo bounding ahead.

The returning had emotional effects on both
of us, and during the evening of our fifth day of
hiking, Sybil and I were sitting by our camp fire
when she squeezed my hand and asked, ‘Keith, dar-
ling? Would you be terribly mad at me if I insisted
on just one favor from you?”’

“Of course not, honey,’ I replied. “Anything
you want. Anything at all.”’

-“All right,” She said, beaming with pure
happiness. ““Then take me back to the cabin.’’ And
when I gaped at her in unbelieving amazement,
Sybil turned her face squarely into mine, so | could
clearly see the sincerity in her eyes and repeated.

“Please, Kieth. Take me back home.”’

NEVER BECOME TOO LONELY

Lost in the wilds of Africa for two years,
A professor of English wept lonely tears.
“Oh to talk to someone,’’ he said to the breeze,
‘All I have about me are animals and trees.’’

One day—he caught a careless tiger in a trap.

To the professor, Mr. Tiger looked an intelligent chap.
And he was, for English, the tiger did very soon grasp.
Causing the professor to leave open the cage’s hasp.

That evennng—out strolled Mr. Tiger saying, ‘‘It 1s
food I desire!’’

aes said the learned one, ‘‘come sit by the

“Pardon Sir,’’ interrupted the tiger, “‘I’Ul gust gnaw
