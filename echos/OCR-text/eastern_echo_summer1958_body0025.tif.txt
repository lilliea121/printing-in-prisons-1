be accepted as an indication of an easy win for the
Chesquad.  hroushout, the tarsi halt, ait was! <a

play by the All-Stars, the visitors led at half-time,
BOlone

Beginning the second half, General Electric,
with fast breaks and deadly outside shooting, began
to pull away. The All-Stars went all out trying to
match their opponent’s pace and at times they did.
But, when the visitors were pressed, they increased
their speed even more.

As shown by their individual scoring, the GH
Five are a well balanced team: Gallagher, who
was a demon with his corner shots, scored 17 points;
Joe McCunney, a dead-eye dick from outside, hit for
19 points; Big Bill McGuire, a good playmaker, reg-
istered 14 tallies; Doyle, hitting from both inside
and out, accounted for 15 points and Devlin, who
wasn’t one of the starting five, scored 16 points.
The remaining two on the visitor’s bench, Ward and
Downs, didn’t see much action.

The outstanding players for the All-Stars were;
Harry ‘‘Teeny’’ Berry, who was also high scorer of
the game with 25 points; Harry “Spots’’ Fricker,
who seemed to never tire, accounted for 16 tallies
and John ‘‘Obie’’ O’Brien, an excellent playmaker,
who scored 10 points. Joe Buzzard was appointed
captain of the visiting GE squad and the All-Stars
were piloted by Wright and MecNeair.

It was a balmy spring afternoon, the area sur-

EASTERN ECHO

rounded by cheering spectators. The occasion? The
Cherry Hill All-Stars were preparing to meet the
Bell Telephone Basketball Team on the home court.
The lineups:

BELL TELEPHONE ALL-STARS
Jack Rice i Morrison
Jim Weisbecker K Shepherd
Bob Barber C ' Leeny 2 Bern,
John Gallagher G Fricker
Bobby Diem G Woody

From the opening whistle this was a game that
kept the referees, Jerry Brooks and Harry Mowry,
on their toes. The game began at a furious pace
with both teams driving hard. The All-Stars Shep-
herd and Woody combined their efforts to show the
spectators some dazzling offensive play backed by
Teeny’s superb play on the boards, and, for the Bell
Telephone Five, Gallagher, Weisbecker and Rice led
a spirited offense. Tap-in shots by Barber, corner
shots by Gallagher and Rice’s jump-shots brought
cheers from the crowd.

Both teams demonstrated heads-up defensive
play, All-Stars Teeny, Jimmy Morrison, Harry
Fricker, John O’Brien, Curley Heath, Juice Cohen
and Big Wesley gave their all to make this the
game of games. They all played together; making
this a team victory. The first half ended with the
Bell Telephone Five leading, 36-29.

The second half featured more of the same
sparkling play, bringing cheers from the crowd
throughout the period. Shepherd and Woody con-
tinued to lead the All-Stars in scoring while Teeny,
Jimmy Morrison and Harry Fricker lent able sup-
port both offensively and defensively.

This was an afternoon when everything seemed
to go right for the All-Stars and glancing to the
bench, one could see their manager, Horace Wright,
smiling his approval of the Stars’ performance.

A very good game with both teams playing as
if a championship was at stake. With one minute
and twenty-five seconds of official playing time re-
maining, the Bell Telephone Five froze the ball
trying for one last shot, the score being tied 79-79.
They failed to get the shot off and the game went
into overtime. Jn the five minute overtime period
the All-Stars really went to work and proved to the
cheering crowd that they had the winning spirit and
were not to be denied. You guessed it, the All-Stars
gained a well-earned victory, the final score was
89-86.

Before going into the statistics, let’s give a big
vote of thanks to: Gilmore, scorekeeper; Speedy
Griffin, official timekeeper; Charles Tobin, statis-
heian and Hark “Sports = Brown, your se Aan
