REQUIEM FOR THE BLUE GIANTS

As far as competition goes the Blue
Giants were loaded (at the beginning of
the season) with some promising ma-
terial in Tampa Red, Pigmeat, Big
Mack, Norman Pearson, and a few
others experienced men to go along
with some fancy-footed rookies. How-
ever, through the maze of disorganiza-
tion came bitter defeat. Die-hards like
Eddie Brooks, Norman and Mack kept
the team’s spirit kindled and the spec-
tators busy with the usual bolt of blar-
ing criticism and heckling. I suppose
last year’s season can be called poor
football. Supposition to the wind and
pen to paper, recalling some exhilarat-
ing moments on our football field, this
guy for a committee of one asserts a
vote of thanks for all those who par-
ticipated in 1963’s football season.

NEW COLORS

We're off for 1964. Tenative plans
from the Athletic Director tend to show
that he is planning a banner year for
us in presenting Outside Teams. In both
Softball and Basketball, many new
teams will be visiting our Institution
under the sponsorship of Mr. Lewis.
Current planning calls for a “45” game
Basketball Schedule and a “25” game
Softball Schedule. Basketball is sched-
uled to get underway on Saturday
Afternoon, March 21, 1964, weather
permitting, with Softball following on
Sunday April 26, 1964.

The teams to be selected to represent
the Institution against Outside visitors
will sport a new color this season. They
will be wearing “Blue and Gold’’ and
will be known as the “‘Penn Towne
League!’ Every effort is being made to
give you a steady diet of week-end
entertainment in sports. With your ef-
forts and your cooperation we are look-
ing forward to making 1964 a winning
season for the Institution.
