The quality of mercy 1s not strain d,

It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven

Upon the place beneath: it 1s twice blest;

It blesseth him that gtves, and him that takes:
T1s mightiest in the mightiest: 1t becomes

The throned monarch better than his crown;

Fis sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy 1s above this sceptred sway;

It 15 enthroned in the hearts of kings,

It 1s an attribute to God himself;

And earthly power doth then show Itkest Godâ€™ s
When mercy seasons gustice. Therefore, Few,
Though justice be thy plea, consider thts,

That, in the course of justice, none of us

Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. Hr ec elles
