Just before I left him aboard the S.S. George
Washington, I said to George, “You'll have no trou-
ble with the safe. And none getting into the house
either, for Tanya says the doors on the second floor
terrace will be open. She said they’ll also be a party
going on that night, so you won’t have to worry

her, among other things, that I’d bring the tools and
the hired car for George in the morning. When I
finished I asked her if she was satisfied with the plan.

Tanya, who’d been poking at the logs in the
fireplace while I was talking, gave me a bewitching
smile as she shook her head to smooth out her long,
