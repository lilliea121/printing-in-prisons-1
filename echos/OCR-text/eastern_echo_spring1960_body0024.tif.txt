“Sentimental Do-gooders,”’ ... Catch phrase
of our times, this expression has become a cliched
springboard from which are launched the vicious
character-destroying attacks upon those of our
society who refuse to believe that man is not all
animal, and contrarily insist that even the misfits of
the community have human traits worth salvaging.
Let any man, however respected and law-abiding,
raise his voice in protest against the age-old theory
that only “an eye for an eye” will halt the spread of
crime, and he can rest assured that before the day is
over he will have been publicly branded with the
scornful label of “sentimental do-gooder.”

This attitude may be just another reflection of
the philosophy of conformism which in this frantic
age effectively places a stranglehold on the throat of
progress in many social areas. Under the miscon-
ceived tenets of conformism, do-goodism, along with
such other attributes of civilization as culture and
common courtesy, is a mark of individuality, and
therefore a weakness to be despised. However, it is
my belief that the defamation of the once honored
“do-gooders” of our communities can be more direct-
ly traced to a wilful and malicious mis-classification.

DBRENSIE

With the arbitrary addition of the adjective
“sentimental” the word “do-gooder” becomes a
phrase used to describe in the words of the user, a
weepy, soft-hearted individual whose opinions are
merely the blatherings of an unrealistic dreamer. By
thus using the semantic trickery of the advertising
copywriter and the social indictment of non-conform-
ism, those who questionably describe themselves as
“straight thinkers” heap scorn upon the “do-gooders”’
of the land.

Yet to do good must be essentially a good thing.
Wherefore then lies its harm? Only in the fact that
“do-goodism” has become an all inclusive phrase ap-
plied to any thoughts or actions which oppose the
hoary theories of those self-proclaimed “straight-
thinkers” who advocate the “Get Tough Policy.” It
is harmful to them in that it threatens their position
as self-proclaimed authorities by attacking their pro-
grams of revenge. By awakening the public to the
known fact that such programs have consistently
failed, and presenting for discussion and action new
methods based on social science and a human ap-
proach, the “do-gooders” disturb the peace of mind
of their opponents. For this reason they must be de-
stroyed, if possible, by oratorical and editorial at-
tacks.

Strange enough, there was a time when “do-
gooders” were publicly honored for their contribu-
tions to society. Today it seems they must hide their
faces lest they be pointed out to little children as
ogres who beset society with the evils of Christianity
and enlightened social attitudes.

The almost complete reversal in the public atti-
tude towards such people can be vividly demon-
strated. Perhaps you will remember the case of the
brilliant attorney who, after becoming Attorney Gen-
eral, became a judge in one of the higher courts of
this state. Highly esteemed by all men of his profes-
sion, he capably fulfilled his duties in both positions.
Nationally recognized for his qualifications, he
brought individuality to the bench of the court to
which he was appointed. However, it then developed
that he had one grievous flaw. He was a “do-gooder,”
or at least so-named by his detractors. Suddenly his
previously recognized brilliance, competence, esteem,
and qualifications were unimportant factors. His
party, under the urgings of the “straight-thinkers,”
dumped him at election time. (Please excuse the ex-
pression, but it is the only proper one.)
