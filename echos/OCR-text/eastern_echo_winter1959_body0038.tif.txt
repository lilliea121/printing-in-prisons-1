The running of Adderly seemed to be an inspir-
alton it@® tme IRecl team,  IBreoolks euacl — IMreianay
McLaughlin, a newcomer, also played a prominent
part in containing the Red team throughout the
afternoon. The game produced the season’s surprise
in veteran “Gaylord” Robinson who is really playing
some fine ball.

Oct. 30—The Cobras met the Colts today in a hard
fought affair. The final whistle found Gallagher’s
Cobras besting Mickey Taylor’s Colts by a 13-7 score.
Colts Squad: Mickey ‘Taylor, Rice, Nick, Bell,
Bennett, Tennessee, Bean, Gaylord, Harman, Gard-
ner, Massey, Mobley and Breaker.

Cobras Squad: Gallagher, Teasey, Cantoral, Richie,
Trish, Mayberry, Ditters, Joe, Mike, Green, Shep and
Norman.

The two pass interceptions by Mickey Taylor
were alert defensive maneuvers. William Bell, run-
ning from the left-half slot, showed his ability with
the pigskin and almost broke loose on a number of
occasions. The Colts’ only touchdown was scored
by Nick behind the brilliant blocking of his team-
mates. The extra point was added by Nick, the
plunging full back, who is a speedy and very alert
newcomer.

Rice, another newcomer, showed promise and is
to be watched because he gets better with each game.
Tucker, another-end-come-lately, is to be praised for
a fine game at end where he is an ever-present dan-
eer.

CARDINALS CAGED BY INSPIRED PHILLIES

Aug. 19—The eall “Play Ball’ marked the beginning
of the playoffs for second place with Little Mack’s
“Phillies” meeting the “Cardinals” which we dubbed
the “Snuff Chewing Team.”

There were two outstanding games in the series
of seven. In game No. 1, Miketish of the Phillies
hurled a four-hitter opposing Bogardus who gave up
only five hits, but lost to the Phillies by a 2 - 1 score.
Game No. 6 was an extra-inning contest with Mike-
tish opposing Cleve Brown and winning by a 3-2
Score.

The Phillies took the first game, the Cardinals
bounced back to win the next three games. The
Phillies entered game No. 5 inspired and captured
the series with three straight victories in games 5, 6,
aunel T.

The Phillies defense was strengthened by
Jerome, Williams, Rob, Ray and Joe. The Cardinals
countered defensively with Hooks, Cleve, Harman
and Junior. Hach game was definitely a team vic-
tory with each player giving his best performance.
