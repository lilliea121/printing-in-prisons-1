n our article, “Employer Wanted”, (published in
I our last edition of The Eastern Echo) we tried to
impress upon society, and particularly Employers,
the incongruity of judging our Inmate Population
by the very small percentage of ‘““Parolees” who defy
social and parole rules to continue their wayward
life of Crime. We gave you an accurate percentage
of the men released, who profit by their mistakes
and become good citizens and loyal, constructive em-
ployees. The percentage was an overwhelming test-
imony to the success of our parole system.

However, as we tried to elucidate on the Parole
situation in its entirety, we did not deal with the
individuals already on parole, or those who will be-
come eligible for parole. For obvious reasons, we
cannot, at this time, give you the success stories of
our parolees who now live side by side with society.
We anticipate doing this in the very near future.
However, we can present some “Thumbnail” resumes
of men whom shall become available for release and
employment within the period of this issue. We
hope to be able to continually supply you with a
more expansive list of available manpower in all
future issues. This shall permit prospective em-
ployers a study of our available manpower for pos-
sible utilization as employees.

As you are probably aware, our Institution is
a “City within a City.” Our population, much as
yours, is comprised of men from all walks of life,
who entertain various and sundry vocations and
avocations. The scope of abilities and talents are
wide and varied. We are able to supply Salesmen,
Accountants, Machinists, Chemists, Farmers, Cooks,
Bakers, Printers, Dental Technicians, Medical Tech-
nicians, Writers, Artists, Typewriter Repairmen,
Box Factory Workers, Cobblers, Tailors, Barbers,
Laborers, and a host of other skilled and semi-skilled
workers. Many of our men have acquired a trade
through schooling and practical application, while
serving the sentence imposed upon them by the
Courts. Others have continued in the field of their
choice, acquired from their previous positions in
society. However, without question, we are able to
provide the most varied source of manpower avail-
able for your needs. A wealth of employment re-
source lies “untapped” at your fingertips.

If I were in the position of an Employer, I
would certainly take advantage of such availability.
Further, a thought which may not have occurred to
you, we are able to school and train men for your
individual needs. That is, IF, you will make those
needs known to us! We have many young men
entering our Institution with comparatively short
sentences to serve. These men could, and should,
be considered for their potential worth to industry
upon their release. If tests and study should prove
them to be qualified for your future needs, other
than the necessary theoretical application of the
particular phase of business you are anxious to de-
velop, the theory and practical development can be

initiated and consumated during his period of in-
carceration. Thus, upon his release, two very im-
portment factors would be realized. A young man
would be developed to shoulder his responsibilities
and become an integral part of society; and—you
would have, through incite and farsight, manufac-
tured a special tool designed to further its efficient
progress! This is a highly constructive means of
preserving the social order of a community and re-
tarding the progress of crime. Needless to say,
your corporation would be absolved of the costs

Employe:

which must be considered in an organizational train-
ing program. Again, we are offering to you and
Industry, FREE SERVICE!!

With these thoughts in mind, let us continue
by supplying you with resumes of two men who will
become eligible for parole on or about the date of
this issue. Let us reassure you, these men were not
“handpicked.” We did not scan our files for the
two most promising backgrounds and submit them
to you as typical of all you might expect in the fu-
ture in order to gain your interest. Mr. Rufus,
our Parole Officer, had the numbers of six men who
will become eligible for release in October or No-
vember. I took the first two numbers off the list
and interviewed them. J knew nothing about their
past records or personal backgrounds. We are giv-
ing you an honest portrait of the individuals avail-
able for your usage, and we shall continue to do so!
