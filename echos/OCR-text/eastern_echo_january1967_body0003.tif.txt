The $kimpins $tate $tir

A non-convict earning $315.00 per month ($283.50
take home pay after a ten-percent tax deduction)
would immediately assess the prices which follow, as
being too high in ratio to his monthly wages. Beyond
this assessment would lie the bewildering and knotty
problem of how he could maintain self-reliance.

One carton of cigarettes for $196.00

One pack of roll-your-own target tobacco for $6.30
One box of matches for $9.80

One skipping ball point pen for $14.00

One tube of toothpaste for $18.90

One bar of lux lovely for $7.70

One pint of ice cream for $23.10

One package of Gillette blades for $14.70

One candy bar for $2.80

The convict in Hastern Prison earning $4.50 per
month ($4.05 ‘‘take home pay’’ after a ten-percent
savings deduction) is very much aware of a wage to
price disparity. For the Eastern prisoner earning
$4.50 per thirty day month while paying 33¢ for one
pint of ice cream, 1s paying proportionately the same
price as the $315.00 non-convict wage earner buying
his $23.10 pint of ice cream. (See related article, The
High Cost of Living, on page 5 of this issue. )

When Dwight D. Eisenhower was President, and
while discussing with striking miners their griev-
ances, he said in response to the miners question on
how they could attain security, ‘‘the only people who
have security are in prison.’’ Sing...
Happy days are here again,
For those of us who are really In,
Oh happy days are here again.
In totality prisoners lead an abnormal way of life.
One need not search far for the norm—a community
