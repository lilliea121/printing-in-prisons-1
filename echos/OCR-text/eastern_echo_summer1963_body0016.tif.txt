ity and free of hypocrisy and pretense.

[t is a grave mistake and an unsound method of rea-
soning to estimate some of these old boys below their
true value. In all probability, many of them have
lived such frantic lives, that now, the only thing they

find exciting is — the peaceful monotony of prison

life.

Much credit is due to inmate John “‘Blackie’”’
O’Lock, General Factotum of the block. He is pri-
marily responsible for the improved over-all living
conditions and the cleanliness of the section, because
of his ability to continually present a formula to meet
the immediate needs of the block, and to produce
more, with less human drudgery. He has a special
knack of utilizing the knowledge and experience of
some of the old boys who are still too young to be
“put out to pasture.”’ Help is a two-way street, and
Blackie is first to acknowledge how essential the co-
operation of the officials and inmates has been in ex-
pediting the transformation of 9 Block. Much paint,
soap, and muscle have made immense changes and
improvements; a whiteness and crispness that he and
his aides are continually trying to surpass.

Very little is known of the alertness that is so
vitally necessary in caring for the chronically ill, or
of the many acts of kindness that are considered run-
of-the-mill for 9 Block: The checking and recheck-
ing of heart patients; the painstaking conversation
and explanations that are given to the aged who are
not yet acclimated to their new surroundings, and
are easily shaken by the seeming disturbances of
change; the effort required to explain that the ‘‘old
order changeth,”’ giving place to the new, and if met
with understanding can often provide a brighter out-
look. The end results of this effort can be most grat-
ifying. Rewards vary with the individual. There is
no gratuity for these acts. Men do not receive their
greatest potential from a materialistic goal. Altru-
ism is not unknown, even among inmates of a peni-
tentiary.

Horace “Johnny” Bowers, Blackie’s aide-de-
camp devotes his every free minute in using his in-
genuity to acquire the many necessities for the block
when all attempts in other channels fail. He is for-
ever finding the things we need, when nobody loses
them. For the old boys, he can come up with cigars,
cigarettes, a chaw of tobacco, even a plug for the
knot hole in some old guy’s wooden leg. While
Blackie keeps an ever alert eye on a few of the old

boys who are a little reluctant to bathe regularly.
His suggestion to them to visit the shower room, goes
over like a pregnant woman in a bikini bathing suit.

In affording accommodations to the aged and
infirm, all meals are delivered via food truck directly
to each cell. Norman ‘Hooks’? Hoxter is our cu-
linary man in charge of silverware. He sterilizes,
delivers, and collects the eating utensils and food
dispensing equipment three times a day, and keeps
a neat and clean kitchen cabinet. Hook says, ‘“The
old timers really have good etiquette, and everyone
knows that good etiquette is knowing which two fin-
gers to put in your mouth when whistling for an ex-
tra cup of coffee.”

Others on the block who lend a helping hand
are: Paul Neal, Charlie Dione and Al Kumitis. My
apologies if | inadvertently overlooked anyone, and
I also wish to apologize for laughing at old Guy, he
has no teeth, but can chew celery until it sounds as
if he were walking on peach baskets. These old
boys have destroyed completely the foolish maxim
that the good die young.

It seems to me that when we decide to write an
article, we should also determine if we are going to
endeavor to offer something of value based either on
our experience and knowledge or derived from study
and research. If we can’t do either of these things,
at least we can respectfully offer a suggestion or two,
or ask questions. No question is a stupid question,
if it is asked in all sincerity. Many times something
of value may be accomplished in this manner. The

idea is: Let's not just sit here!

We realize that decisions of this nature cannot
be made inthe interest of pure sympathy and on
what might be justified in the eyes of some, by the
merits of the individual case. To undertake to eval-
uate objectively is indeed a perilous and humbling
task.

The motivation behind this article is aimed at
finding some new and more practical way of dealing
with a situation that — to my knowledge — has
made little or no progress in 20 years.

I do not wish to belittle the efforts already so
energetically pursued in the welfare of the aged and
infirm of 9 Block. However, I think much more can
be done for them. These are my personal opinions;
I hope they are accepted as such and not as conclu-
sions. My sole intent is to focus a little attention on
a situation, in hopes that perhaps a little better un-
derstanding could possibly lead to some logical sug-
gestions for a new course of action for some very
tired, sick, old men, who are sitting alone in a room
with no view. ®
