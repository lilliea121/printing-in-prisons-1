the problems of our youth involved in crimes

today, I wish to emphasize that they are not
limited to sectional or local boundriesâ€”but from
coast to coast and border to border. They disclose
a malignant threat over every home in this nation.
They reveal a tremendous responsibility which
should be undertaken by every citizen of the United
States. They are the problems which confront so-
ciety namely, the awful fact that the majority of
crimes today are committed by our youth.

I believe that one reason why youth has en-
gaged in criminal activities is because parents and
society have failed to provide them with the proper
outlets and up-bringing. It can reasonably be said
that only in the rarest instances of diseased minds
has a first offender ever committed a crime because
of plain antisocial sentiments. Our youth of to-
day have fallen into criminal activities mostly be-
cause of either deep-laid faults in society, such as
poverty, degeneracy, etc., or because they are com-
pletely neglected by their parents.

A great percentage of the crimes being com-
mitted today in these United States are being per-
petrated by young persons who have not yet reached
the voung age. They commit murder, arson,
thievery, robbery and other malignant outrages, be-
cause they are youths of immature minds and
bodies; youths who at their age should be reaching
the threshold of a useful life. It definitely is not
a healthful outlook, nor is it a pleasant picture. It

is not a normal condition when society must bow
under the disgrace of circumstances in which a
large percentage of our robbers and murderers are
just a little beyond their childhood. Therefore, it
becomes incumbent upon society to recognize the
causes of such scandalous conditions, and to search
for the means by which they may be meliorated.

Usually, when a youth commits a crime, it is
because of laxity in early discipline, or because of
apathy on the part of parents, and the complete
neglect of those in the community who should have
helped the helpless. Parents and the community
must work together with a dual purpose to combat
the growth of criminal instincts in our youth of
today.

All too often it is found that the majority of
children have become criminals because of the fol-
lowing reasons. They came from a family where
selfishness was always predominant, or a family
in which incompatibility led to divorce of the
parents; or perhaps one in which the parents were
concerned only with their own pleasures, leaving
the youths to drift as they pleased. It may have
been because they were poverty-ridden, ignorant
people, not fully realizing their responsibilities to
their children, or just not caring about them. It
is almost inevitable that the attitude of parents
