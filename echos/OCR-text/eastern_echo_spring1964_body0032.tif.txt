ACADEMIC DEGREES AWARDED AT SCHOOL DEDICATION

In today’s world of complex learning it has become
both imperative and necessary for every citizen of the
United States to acquire (at least) a high school ed-
ucation. It is being emphasized by no less than our
state and federal governments. They are concerned
for the simple reason that, a government can only
function as well as the governing powers. It is indeed
a fact that in the past, too many men and women
have walked out of the many prisons without ade-
quate knowledge to sustain their financial conditions
by better job opportunities. This has been a sore spot
with many penologists. This institution undertook the
task of alleviating this condition by building a new
school addition, to better facilitate the flow of men
desiring to learn.

On February 3, 1964, the new building was for-
mally dedicated with many important individuals be-
ing present to lend their appearance and good wishes
to the success of this constructive endeavor. Also,
highlighted during the festivities were the awarding
of diplomas to the men who had acquired their aca-
demic standings within the old building and under
past conditions. They were lauded for their desire to
learn in spite of past inadequate facilities.

Among those present at the dedication were Mr.
Arthur T. Prasse—Commissioner, Bureau of Correc-
tion; Dr. Kenneth E. Taylor—Deputy Commissioner,
Bureau of Correction; Dr. Harry A. Snyder—Educa-
tion Program Specialist, Bureau of Correction; Dr.
Benjamin W. Barkas—Asst. Director of School Ex-
tensions, Philadelphia Board of Education; Mr. Wil-
liam E.. Brunton—Director, Vocational and Industrial
Arts, Board of Education, City of Philadelphia; Mr.
Randolph E. Wise—Commissioner of Public Wel-
fare; Mr. Bowman and Mr. Jordan of the General
State Authority. Also present were Messrs. Harry
Gransback, Larry Rees, Isadore Kurman, Lawrence
F. Kaul and Michael Montemuro—Instructors here at
the State Correctional Institution, and Mr. James
Magee—Reporter for the Philadelphia Evening Bul-

letin.

Officials in attendance from the State Correctional
Institution at Philadelphia were: Mr. Alfred T. Run-
dle—Superintendent; Mr. Joseph R. Brierley—Dep-
uty Superintendent; Mr. Thomas H. Graham—Direc-
tor of Treatment; Mr. William Berg—Social Service
director; Mr. Robert Burman—Director of Educa-
tion; Father John McHugh—Catholic Chaplain; Re-

verend Sidney Barnes—Protestant Chaplain.

ost and Benediction Intoned by Reverened

arnes.

Mr. Graham introduced the guests and directed the
speakers in turn at the lectern. Brief talks were given
by: Dr. Snyder, Dr. Barkas, Mr. Brunton, Mr. Wise,
ene of course Mr. Rundle and Mr. Prasse in that
order.

The speakers displayed a harmony of thought on
education being a must in relation to our advance-
ment—in and out of prison. Mr. Rundle gave the
recipients of the diplomas acknowledgement for their
studious efforts.

It was more than an award receiving benefit. The
subtle meaning lie in the fact that, men if given the
chance can and will avail themselves of the oppor-
tunity to advance educationally. And in doing so al-
ter—not only their academic thinking but sociol-
ogically as well.

DESERVING DINER’S

On January 27, 1964, in the Officers Dining
Room, thirty-five inmates were assembled for a spe-
cial dinner in recognition of their particular service
to our entombed society. These thirty-five men form
the 3 Block entourage of the medical staff. Blood-
sucker’s, pill-pushers, Enema Nightingale’s—what-
ever we fondly call them, this steak homage was de-
served and earned by the hospital crew.

A full complement of medical personnel were on
hand in the person of Doctors:
Nathan Blumberg — Medical Director
Armando Goracci — Surgeon
Robert Frantz — Staff Physician
Phillip Marone — Staff Physician

The correctional body of the institution was re-
presented by:
Alfred T. Rundle — Superintendent
Joseph Brierley —- Deputy Superintendent
Thomas Graham — Director of Treatment
Sergeant Ronald Marks — Custodial Super-
visor of the hospital

From the brief talks given by the men cited above,
sincere appreciation of the inmates hospital duties,
well performed, is the axis off which overall hospital

harmony is seen to prevail. r")
