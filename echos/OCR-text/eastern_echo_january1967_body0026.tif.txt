Dialogue In Rhetoric ?

by Tommy Williams

This apparently harmless conversation took
place in the year 1963 in a fashionable sub-
urb in one of our typical American cities.
Mr. Ignoramus, a reporter for the Daily
Slanderer, is making a door to door ques-
tion and answer survey on prisons.

Reporter approaches the first of the neat
little stucco homes and proceeds to ring
the doorbell. A bespectaled gentleman
with sparse hair and a pipe hanging
loosely in his mouth opens the door.

Pardon me, sir, for disturbing you, but I
am wondering if you would care to an-
swer a few questions. I am making a sur-
vey for a column soon to be run in my
newspaper.

Why! I don’t think I’d mind, providing
it doesn’t take too long. Do you have
your press card with you?

Yes sir, here it is.

Okay. Come in and make yourself com-
fortable. Have a seat in the living room
and I will be with you in a moment.

(Reporter sits in one of the high, stiff-
backed chairs, crosses his legs, takes out
pencil and pad and thus begins this
contemporaneous conversation. )

What is your name, sir?

Professor Know It All. Professor I. C.
Know It All of the C. R. University of
Criminology, to be exact.

Why, this is a coincidence. My survey is
based on our American prisons. I am
quite sure you can help me. Uh, by the
way, sir... what does C. R. stand for?

(The gentleman shall be referred to here-
after as professor, befitting his respect-
ed title.)

Cops and Robbers.

That’s a strange name for a University.

Oh well, lets get on with it. Now, for the

first question. What do you think of
prisons in general?

Many of my colleagues say—and I agree
—that they are the politicians’ melting
pots, the tabloids’ scapegoats, the devi-
ates’ haven and lastly, to quote an old
cliche, “a necessary evil.”

I see. Now sir, to the next question. Do
you believe that prisons have changed in
its treatment of inhabitants, say, in the
last 25 to 50 years?

Definitely. The physical torture of the
past has now been replaced by mental
torture which leaves its scars on the in-
side. So for all practical purposes, the
individual appears in good shape; not-
withstanding grey hairs and facial lines
which time bestows on us all. In reality
a person becomes no more than a walk-
ing vegetable when incarcerated too
long.

There was an article in our paper not
long ago concerning two convicts who
tried to escape. One was shot fatally in
the attempt. Would you eare to com-
ment on this, sir?

I think the convicts should be given a
medal.

Are you serious?

Quite! You see; man, though he doesn’t
eare to acknowledge it, is only an animal

. of the highest order, and like all
creatures, dislikes being denied the nat-
ural and instinctive freedom of will and
movement. Why do you think they keep
animals in cages? Even the smallest
ones, no matter how well you feed them
or keep their pen clean, are only making
the best of a bad situation. Their docil-
ity doesn’t mean they are contented, for,
such conditions are so alien, or should be,
to an animal’s nature that attempting to
escape this despicable condition should
be tantamount to finding a cure for
cancer.

Well, that was a unique answer. Any-
way, Professor, do you think America
