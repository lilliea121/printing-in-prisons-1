ing since 1828) provides plenty of work and an op-
portunity for those interested to learn. There is no
rush-like-mad attitude to complete any of the work,
lest the purpose of vocational therapy be lost in the
process. Upon completion, this therapy will be
carried over into maintenance work.

Being ‘‘con-wise’’ and alert to all the conni-
vance and perversions of prison routine, we had an
absorbing curiousity to know the reason for the
hustle and interest in this work, so we blandly
spotlighted the question to Mr. McMenamin. Not
being a descendant from the ‘‘Old Sod’’ we were
somewhat amused by the manner in which he re-
lated that which is conspicuously obvious: Prison-
ers definitely are people, and this fact is apparently
foremost in Mr. McMenamin’s mind. Give them a
chance to do something constructive — a chance to
find themselves, so to speak—and they will soon
learn, like other people, that they are doing things
today which they could not do yesterday.

As Mr. McMenamin says, take a look at the old
Chapel for instance. We not only took a look, we
were so impressed that we had it photographed for
our readers. However, unless you know what the
old place was like before renovation, you may not
fully appreciate it. The boys took a real interest
in this job. It is only natural that they should.
They assemble here for religious worship. It is a
common Chapel, but it is the INMATE’S church.

The plaster work depicted in the photo, com-
prising two huge pilasters supporting a quasi-the-
atrical butterfly, in contemporary design, with ad-
joining stage wings, tends to simulate wooden
mouldings of various colonial shapes and patterns.
There are rumors that the boys plan on some floor
covering, too. Nothing elaborate, though. Some-
thing in gray linoleum runners, about 48 inches
wide, will just about round out the decor. Who
knows, somebody may be inclined to oblige with
about 150 feet of the required material ... never
can tell!

But back to Mr. ‘‘Mac’”’ who as an instructor
at the institution also maintains the status of prison
guard. As such, this gentleman holds the distine-
tion of never having made a ‘“‘pinch’’. For those
unfamiliar with prison jargon, we mean to say he
has not experienced the bitter task of citing any of
his charges with an alleged misconduct. Uneanny,
but true.

Broadly speaking, Mr. McMenamin operates on
the theory, or if you prefer, the philosophy, that
there are several ways of dealing with prisoners.
One is to try to dominate them. Another is to
assume a submissive attitude before them. And
another, by far the most successful, is to simply treat
them as people.

Mr. McMenamin is obviously inclined to the last
mentioned.

ECHO BOUQUET

A bouquet of thanks unstintingly goes to Mr.
Frank Frei, of Adolph Frei & Sons, Inc., leading
ecclesiastical decorators established in 1884, for
the tremendous contribution in designing the
newly refurbished chapel-auditorium at Eastern
Penitentiary, and supervising the work involved.
Mr. Frei not only gave of his expert advice, time,
and some material and equipment, but was direct-
ly responsible in promoting the skilled help of
his employees, one of whom (Mr. Otto Sohns) is
pictured with him above.

The total contribution covered a span of
nearly six months, obviously hampered by the
necessity of maintaining uninterrupted scheduled
inmate activities such as attendance at religious
services, movies, and other diverse assemblies
which are all held in the chapel-auditorium, there
being no substitute facilities. Although so incon-
venienced, Mr. Frei was not deterred or dis-
couraged from giving his very best. All the walls
and workwork were rejuvinated in a blend of
colonial oak, accentuated by hand wood-graining
and a stipple pattern in beautiful colonial har-
mony. While the bulk of the work was perform-
ed by inmates of Lt. Roach’s Building and Trades
Dept., under the supervision of Mr. Frei, his
craftsmen were required, however, to perform and
lead off, as it were, the finer details of the job.
During the process, some of the inmates were
taught the rudiments of interior decorating, and
did remarkably well.

We might add that Mr. Frei was admiringly
impressed with the adaptability of the inmates
to the task. However, he has left the inmates,
and the powers that be, with an even greater im-
pression by his contribution. We shall remember
Mr. Frei, and his kindness, as we do all our bene-
factors, long after he has forgotten our... bou-
quet of thanks. L. J. Biancone
