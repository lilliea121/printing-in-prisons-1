‘““Who’s gonna run scout ?’’

“Scout? Brooklyn, you and Chief will lead
off, but we’re gonna be right on your tail all the way.
We’re gonna run down this mountain. Okay, lets

go.

In two files the Company strung out, men in the
forward sections only dim shadows disappearing
over the brow of the mountain onto the first lap of
the road.

An infantry man will build a kind of sixth sense
Out Ol tear or ihe will to eo om livime, At times
this sense of the unknown will be ridiculed and
termed imagination. It will be laughed at, scorned
by the second guessers and for a little while you be-
come the butt of your squad. When you are wrong
you take the razzing and another fire fight and an-
other piece of terraine and time glosses it over.
When you are right and God is sending you an alert,
nothing ever glosses it over. The second guessers
will never get a third guess and chances are, if
you’re lucky, you will.

On the third curve down, imagination, fear or
fact began to play tricks with my senses. The night
was still—there’s no conversation permitted, be-
cause a voice will carry a long way at night—and
over and above the steady movement of the Company
I could hear another sound. The sound of hob-
nailed boots below!

I approached the dark silhouetted figure in front
of me, and whispered, ‘‘Snuffy, do you hear them
hob-nailed boots below us?’’

Without answering my question, he in turn
asked me, in his dry drawl, ‘‘Baby, when was the
last time yuh were in the rest camp? Son, yore
imagination is goin hawg wild, we’re a long way
from whar those old Jerries are supposed to be.’’

W were approaching another curve, descending
onto the next stretch of road, and the hob nails
rang a steady clang in my ear. No louder perhaps,
but none the less there. I began to get panicky,
thinking mixed up thoughts generated by fear of
the awfulness of the unknown. It’s impossible that
I’m the only one who hears them, I told myself.

I dropped out of line and in a shouted whisper,
asked each dark figure that moved past. ‘‘Pop?
Is that you, Pop?’’ Pop, the old*timer, he would
know—if they were there he would hear them—he
had heard the sound of hob nails often enough. He
would know for sure if anyone did. ‘‘Hey Pop,
is that you Pop?”’

“Yeah son, fall in here with me. What’s up?’’

‘‘Pop, kin you hear those hob nails below us?

Listen close, hear them down there towards the base
of this here mountain.’’

“Take it easy baby. Yore just a little upset,
and don’t be yappin so loud, you’ll have Sarge back
here ravin at us. Remember the first night ya
pulled guard duty at Monte Cassino back in 743?
Ya pulled the pin outta the grenade, ready to toss it,
and then ya dint hear the noise anymore, and, and
the pin was lost an you stannin there holdin the
lever down. Remember that deal?’’

‘Listen kid, we all got two ears and I don’t
hear anything. We got two good men up front, the
Brooklyn Bum and the Chief. Also, the Sarge is
somewhere up front. Don’t ya think they’d hear
the Krauts if there were any? Don’t let your im-
agination get the best of ya.’’

And so it went.

Tlead down and listening, I followed the column
as it snaked its way down the stretches and around
the curves.

All hell broke loose with the suddenness of a
snapt rubber band!

Tracers began flying, Garands slamming, maga-
zine Schmeissers spattering, and the slick put-put of
grease guns, all mixed in with the powerful reports
of grenades.

In the lulls, agony screamed in the language of
pain. In a matter of seconds, the two companies,
German and American, had incredibly fused into a
slashing chaotic battle for survival.

Remembering Sarge’s warning by some mir-
acle, I instinctively dove for the inner side of the
road, blasting at anything that moved near me.
Tripping, stumbling, I managed to gather myself to-
gether behind a piece of fallen timber. My mind
frozen with stark fear, insanely the one phrase re-
peated itself over and over in my mind, “‘I told you
cuys ll fold you, didi Te

The nightmare erupted into a blinding splash of
light, filling my skull with pain and consciousness
seattered into oblivion as I fell.

Daylight and movement brought me back to
reality. Inches from my face stood a pair of hob-
nailed boots. Hob-nailed boots with their owner in
them, standing over me with his burp-gun trained
down on my chest, uttering short gutteral commands
my Shocked brain could not immediately grasp.

Staggering to my feet, my captor pushed his
weapon into the small of my back. Close by lay
Pop, face down, the Brooklyn Bum beside him. Both
dead. I began to walk. Snuffy lay sprawled over
his burnt-out fifty on its tripod, and as I passed him,
automatically the words shipped from my lips, “‘I-
told-you-Snuffy-I-told-you-didn’t-I?”’

“Rouse swine! Nicht Sprechen. Rouse!”’
And I walked down the mountain... as
