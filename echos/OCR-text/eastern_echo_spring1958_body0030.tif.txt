retching sickness that followed ... a fierce desire
smoldering within, erying more, more. A battle waged
... for him it was Gethsemane, a Gethsemane of
untold agony ... time paused for a moment to rest,
as if in silent decision ... It was inevitable...
He as a human being, with all his hopes and despairs,
was crushed. The never ending appetite for the
nectar of the gods could never be appeased; only
bottle after bottle would alleviate the suffermg.. .

He was scolded, screamed at, sermonized. His
mother had tried to keep him straight, but she
ecouldn’t handle him; then there were the police.
Finally the judge . . . voices in the distant haze,
voices as in a dream. He rose and followed, nothing
stirred, save that the air was still ringing with the
call he heard. Before him stretched a gray level

land, where it was neither night nor day, but forlorn
and desolate beyond words.

Along the road what had been trees, though long
dead, seemed begging still to die. The place seemed
very still, still as a stone. Then, in a flash, he knew,
and cried in anguish—‘‘ What is this?’’ <A row of
devils sat as if in judgment, gloating, shadowing
tapers of light shining on their chins and eyes, they
stared and spoke among themselves, while hour after
hour the dark and stars flowed by.

He rejoiced to turn and leave them there. In
merey freed from all his sins, he heard the tuning of
the violins, the rasp of bows, the silence lighten around
the strings. So beautiful it says ‘‘Home! Home
again!’

Chance Encounter
Continued from Page 19

‘““The studios train you,’’ Miss Dodge explained,
“if they think you have some ability, and could
learn.’’

‘‘Perhaps you could look me up,’’ Miss Shorter
suggested. ‘‘That is, if you’re ever out that way.’’

“‘T’m sure it’s very nice of you to suggest it,
Miss Shorter,’’ he said, ‘‘but you wouldn’t remember
me. That is,’’ he amended, “‘if I ever did get to the
coast.’”’

‘Of course I would,’’ she protested. ‘‘Es-
pecially if you mentioned this,’’ she added, pointing
around to the various gifts lying on the dressing
table.

‘‘Well,’’ he said, the idea slowly taking hold of
him, “‘perhaps I might, at that. It’s very kind of
you to suggest it, Miss Shorter,’’ he repeated. He
looked down at the floor, unable to think of anything
to say to express to her his great indebtedness for
befriending him. Perhaps, he thought, this is just
the chance I’ve been waiting for.

Miss Shorter shifted her weight on the bench
and sighed. At once he was conscious that she
would soon have a show to do and would want to
set made up.

“‘T’m afraid I’ve already taken up too much of
your time,’’ he said, closing his sample case. He
shook hands with the secretary first because he was
aware he hadn’t paid too much attention to her, and
wanted to make up for his lack of cordiality.

He turned to the actress. ‘‘Good bye, Miss
Shorter,’’ he said, pressing her hand, turning on her
his widest smile, conscious now that he was acting
to impress her, to let her know that she had not
made a mistake in befriending him. ‘‘Good bye,’’
he said again, ‘‘and thank you for your kindness.”’
He turned and left the dressing room.

Outside, in the narrow corridor, he stopped for
a moment, briefly reliving the events of the past
few minutes, glad now that he had followed his origi-
nal whim. Who knows, he thought, what might come
of this chance encounter? He was beginning to move
away when he heard Miss Shorter speak to her sec-
retary, but he stopped to listen.

“. . . because if you don’t want it,’’ she was

saying to Miss Dodge, ‘‘I wish you’d take it and
throw it away. I don’t want it cluttering up my
dressing room.”’

John felt his face burn with shame and anger,
but he stood still, not quite believing what he had
heard, unable to believe that this was the same woman,
so sweet and charming only a few moments ago.

Someone moved inside the dressing room, and
then Miss Shorter spoke again. ‘‘Meeting creeps
like that is one of the bad features of this job,’’ she
said, speaking in a bored voice. ‘‘It’s almost enough
to drive me back to that jerk I married and make an
honest housewife out of me.’’

John walked quickly away, glad that there was
no one to see his burning face. He gripped his sample
case close to his body and ran quickly up the stairs,
past the crowded bar and out into the coolness of
the street. |
