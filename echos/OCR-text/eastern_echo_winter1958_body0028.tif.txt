the home court to greet their visitors,—the Colts
from South Philadelphia.
The starting line-ups were as follows:

So. Phila. Colts Cherry Hill
Ronald Jones (11) RE Teeny Berry (18)
William Roye (14) LE Harry Fricker (386)
George Boggs (12) C C. Adderly (14)
Ernie Schuler (7) RG Jake (4)
Ronald Shepard (2) LG Jim Morrison (8)

Cautious play marked the early moments of the
game, the Colts being the first to step up the pace.
Controlling the boards, they started a fast-break at-
tack which drew cheers from the crowd. Then, the
Cherry Hill Five, led by Teeny Berry and Charles
Adderly, combined their efforts with the inspired
play of Crane, Fricker and Heath in an offensive
surge that gave the visiting bench something to talk
about. A very spirited and action-packed first half
ended with the Colts in front, 29—21.

During half-time your reporter was able to find
out that the Colts are a well-seasoned, well-coached
team; handled very capably by a gent known as
Lacey who played his basketball for Southern High.
So let’s give our thanks to Lacey for bringing to us
such a fine team and an enjoyable afternoon.

In the second half our home team, led by Berry
and Fricker, put on a late surge and the visitors lead
began to dwindle but, the Colts, with victory on
their mind, matched the home team play for play
and eeked out a 51-47 win.

Let’s extend a hand to Mr. Sekula who directed
. the Cherry Hill Five from the side-lines. Also
deserving of credit for a job well done are Gilmore
and Griffin, the referees; Turk, the timekeeper; and
Bill Morgan of the Colts who, along with Joe
McNeair (our Sports Editor), took care of the score-
keeping duties.

A big vote of thanks to Mr. William Berry, the
Colts’ owner and to Mr. Robert Griffin, a member of
the custodial staff, who met on a bus while riding
to work at the sleepy hour of 5:00 a.m. and made
this game possible.

TIGERS WIN LIGHTWEIGHT OPENER

Sept. 27th, was just another day to some, but
here at Cherry Hill excitement was in the air as two
evenly matched lightweight teams, the Warriors and
and the Tigers, took to the gridiron in the season’s
opener.

The two teams seesawed back and forth until
the closing minutes of the first quarter. With the
Tigers in possession, Grant Stewart faked a hand-off
to his halfback, then dropped back and unleashed a
forty-yard pass to his right end, Saby, on the five-

24

yard line. Harry Zeitz tackled Saby as he hauled
in the toss.

With first down and goal to go, two line plunges
netted only two yards for the Tigers. On third
down they pulled a double-reverse with Richie
Richardson carrying it over for the first six points.
The extra point was made by Stewart with Irish
Cullen paving the way through the center of the
line. The first quarter ended with the Tigers lead-
ing 7-0.

In the second quarter Billy Hallowell fired a
twenty-yard pass to Ronnie Bunts who took the ball
to the Tigers’ ten-yard line. On first down, with ten
yards to pay-dirt, Hallowell handed off to Gaylord ~
who went over left guard for five yards. On second
down, Barrett Duke went over to score. The War-
riors went to the air in their try for the extra point,
but the pass was incomplete. The scoreboard read:
Tigers 7, Warriors 6.

pass to little MeNear for a touchdown and a lead

i @ points. The try. tor the “extra =poimt was
