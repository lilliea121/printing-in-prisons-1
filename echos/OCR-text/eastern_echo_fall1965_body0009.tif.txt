OUR DENTAL LAB

by SHELDON GLASSHOFER

Very few people are aware of the type of work be-
ing done in our Dental Laboratory. Here, dentures
are made for all the correctional institutions in Penn-

sylvania as well as for many of our state hospitals.

The Dental Laboratory is under the capable super-
vision of Albert L. Pilch, a civilian employee of the

Correctional Industries,

Doe Pileh-

affectionately known as

Presently, there are twelve inmates studying and
performing the many technical phases of this intricate

type of work. To learn the various steps involved in
the processing of dentures, as well as the many tech-
nical terms involved, requires a great amount of

study, patience, perseverence and aptitude.

After an inmate has gained this knowledge and he
has acquired the necessary experience—and is ready
to leave the institution—a position is obtained for
him in one of the many fine commercial laboratories.
The Delaware Valley Guild has given, and continues
to give, a great amount of cooperation in placing men
from this institution®s laboratory.

Experience to date proves that men from our Den-
tal Lab are now gainfully employed and have become

respected members of society.

legislature if we are ever to see consistent justice in
Sentencing in Pennsylvania. Wehaven’t the answer,
but we believe there are thousands of prisoners with
suggestions.

There is the need for a law providing an opportunity
for each prisoner in any prison or correctional institu-
tion in this state, to secure his own private medical
and/or psychiatric evaluation by his own means, in the
event there is a question of handling his particular
medical problem; thus, insuring protection of his
individual rights and good health. The legislature
has already seen the need to enact a law providing
similar guarantees to inmates and patients under the

jurisdiction of the Department of Public Welfare.

Eastern Echo

We live in the State where all the legal guarantees
were inacted into law in the Colonial days. In that
same period we were also first in the field of penology,
Unfortunately, it does not appear our penal laws have
made too much progress since those days—and we
wonder about recidivism!

As stated, the legislature of this Commonwealth
will now be able to re-examine the death penalty and
our penal laws. They will have an opportunity to con-
sider other logical and humane transformations in this
system of law and jurisprudence.

We sincerely hope that this august body will recall
the Biblical exhortation of a just, wise, and loving
God: ‘“‘Vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord; I will
repay’’! G.J.H.
