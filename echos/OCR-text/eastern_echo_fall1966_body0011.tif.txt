The Little Giant Press — This is a small job cylinder
press. Nearly all cylinder presses are two-revolution ma-
chines, the cylinders of which make two complete revolu-
tions for each impression. It has a flat bed to hold the
form and an impression cylinder to provide the pressure.
The paper is printed as it passes between them. It is
used primarily for small work in large quantity such as
labels, filing cards, small business forms, invitations, an-
nouncements and many other similar jobs. With modifi-
cations, the cylinder press is used by carton manufac-
turers for cutting and creasing.

The Platen Press — A platen is defined as ‘‘a machine
where the impression is obtained by bringing two flat
surfaces together.’ The first presses used the principle
of impressing a sheet of paper against the printing form.
From the beginning to the present, this principle has
been used. The ability to regulate the amount of
‘squeeze’ makes platen presses extremely versatile. They
can print from the simplest one-color form to fine-register
color-work, on stock ranging from the thinnest paper to
heavy cardboard. Larger platen presses can also be used
for embossing, stamping, die-cutting and scoring. Shown
below are pressmen Joseph McCann and Sheldon Glass-
hoffer.
