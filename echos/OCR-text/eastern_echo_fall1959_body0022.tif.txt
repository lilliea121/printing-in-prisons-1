Leaving the rest to his mistress, Murphy went
“for help” while Catherine “beat the old man till he
could not stand and then laid him on a Couch, when
she twisted a Handkerchief round his Neck in order
to strangle him.” Murphy, meanwhile, reported to
the neighbors that his ““Master was in a fit.”

Catherine told Murphy that she had a hard
struggle with the old man, ‘but I have quieted him
at last.”

Although she stoutly denied her part in the “tri-
angle’ murder, Catherine Bevan was convicted and

The macabre and unusual event took place on
Friday, September 10, 1731 at New Castle. The news
account gives mute evidence of the last moments of the
conspirators:

“Neither said much at the Place of Execution; the
Man seemed Penitent, the Woman hardened. It was
designed to strangle her dead before the Fire should
touch her, but its first breaking out was in a stream
which pointed directly upon the Rope that went around
her Neck, and burnt it off instantly so that she fell alive
into the I‘lames, and was seen to struggle.”

Murphy did admit that most of his testimony
was false; that the woman did not tie the handker-
chief around her husbands neck but that she was
the “Promoter of all that had happened.”

While murder and burglary were the most
common crimes punished by the death penalty in the
colony, arson, rape, buggery and sodomy, and in-
fanticide all carried the death penalty from 1718
through the 1790's.

A notorious case of arson accompanied by murder
occurred in Chester County (now Delaware County)
in 1722. These dual crimes, committed by a 17 year
old indentured servant, William Battin, were referred
to by the Colonial Council as “Divers, Horrid and Com-
phicatedl Cronmes.”

Battin, an illiterate, in a gallows-side speech, dic-
tated while awaiting execution, much of his life and
the circumstances of the crime. Born in Wiltshire,
England, he claimed that at an early age he began to
“serve the Devil”—whom he referred to as the enemy—
“and to obey his voice and by yielding to his tempta-

tions which were Lying and picking and stealing other
Men’s Goods.”

He told of petty thefts which led to his father
shipping him off to the New World as an indentured
servant. He was purchased at the Philadelphia
Wharf by a gentle man from Concord, Delaware
County but was scld to the man whose home he set
fire.

One day, his master and mistress went ‘‘avisit-
ing’ and left the lad to baby sit with the three
children, all young boys. His story of the cowardly
crime is as follows:

“Whilst I was taking Apples, it came into my mind
through the Insinuation and Wile of the Devil, to
fire the House, and burn that and the Children together,
thinking thereby the better to run away, from conclud-
ing others would imagine myself burnt. To accomplish
this barbarous and wicked Design, I Fired the Flax
with the Flame of the Candle.” But his “Heart failed’
so he stamped out the flame—or so he thought, and
returned down the stairs and fell asleep. But he was
awakened “by a great Noise like the firing of a Gun
which made me run upstairs, where I found the fire
revived and the Flames raging through the House,”

The youngest of the children awoke and called
for “his Mummy,’ whereupon the frantic adolescent
slapped the child and ordered him back to bed. He
then ran out of the house and to the neighbors where
his master and m’‘stress were visiting. He arrived
and deliberately told them that the children were
safe.

Battin was tried, convicted and hanged. His last

Thus, once again, Pennsylvania justice was

The only thing is, people must realize that they can’t have their cake and eat it
