‘Alright, let’s move out. We’re going down...’’

THE MOUNTAIN

by HENRY MYERS and WILLIAM CONREY

ee sickly moon flitted timidly over the Vosges
Mountains, taking frightened glances at a world
gone mad, peeking around the edges of soiled clouds
at the ravage of its sister, Earth.

On a mountain top near Alsace-Lorraine, we
rested in reserve, reserve with a two-Second notice
to move out. So we rested; slept, ate, and slept
some more. Slogging out the bone deep tiredness of
climbing mountains, fording rivers and trodding the
fields of battle.

The Battle of Casino seemed like a nightmare far
away and long ago, rumors were ripe, World War il
was beginning to peter out, thoughts of points
yained built golden dreams of home, thoughts of
restful sleep, dry sleep, away from all the wetness
and all the killing that is the very nature of war.

Off in the distance a steady rumble of giant
muted kettle drums, lent a background to the small
noises close at hand. The rain, a cough, metal strik-
ing against a rock, and the murmured voices of men,
dog faces, grizzled and dirty, basking in the luxury
of being able to soak up rest along with the water in
their. fox holes.

A voice speaks: “‘If you could be anywhere

you wanted to be, where would you be?”’
‘‘Back in old Blimey.’’
‘‘Nah, not me. England’s as wet as this dump!”’
“‘T’d like to be in a parachute invading da Vir-
gin Islands!’’
‘‘T would be home.’’

Quietness like a shroud settles, homeward go
the thoughts, bending along the curve of continents,
spanning the oceans, soaring over the mountains
and plains, over structures built to the magnificence
of gods and men, and of course, mice. Flying like
a bird of the night to the cities, the towns and the
whistle stops. Swooping under crenelated portals
into the decore of the dollar. Winging down the
littered corridor of the ghetto. Flitting along the
foliaged lane to home.

Startlngly, hurried words edged with alarm
began barking orders, snapping the mind back to
reality like a released over-tensioned spring.

‘Alright, you bunch of gutless slackers, saddle
up, we got work to do. On your feet, all of you,
get over to the jeep trailer on the road and stock up
on ammo. All hell’s busted loose and some idiot
General got the bright idea you imbeciles can do
