FOOTBALL

Finis was written to Football here at Eastern
when the heavies clashed to wind up the season.
O’Brien’s squad won the game and the championship
to complete an undefeated season.

It was a good year for football; all games
were close, hard fought, and unusually clean.
CONGRATULATIONS are in order.

The lightweights, lacking the power of the
heavies, put on a good show with their speed, run-
ning and slick ball handling.

The heavyweights, as always, were the glamour
teams. When they met it was like two herds of
mastodons meeting head-on. It was rumored that
the seismograph recorded an earth tremor in this
area.

Mr. Graham again did a fine job in handling the
teams. We owe a vote of thanks to John Gilmore
and Dave Crockett for the fine job they did in ref-
ereeing the games.

I have been asked many times about the status
of the players. Would my opinion be in agreement
with all who watched these men play? Hardly;
so I took myself off the hook by putting the question
to the players themselves. Here are the All-Star
teams, as chosen by the players themselves:

HEAVY WEIGHTS

Q. B. Jimmie McKenna — H. B. John O’Brien —
H. B. John Collins — F. B. Rufus Coleman — R. E.
Battles — L. E. Curley — R. T. Brickhouse — L. T.
Bernie Alexander — R. G. Knock Knock — L. G.
Dave Wilder — C. Whitey Fran Raimer.

LIGHTWEIGHTS

Q. B. Bill Hollowell — H. B. Stew — H. B.
Gillis — F. B. Watson — L. E. Richie — R. E.
Salty — L. T. Billy Wright — R. T. Louis — L. G.
Barrett Duke — R. G. Willie — C. Pee Wee.

AT MUSCLE BEACH

Due to the inclement weather at this time-no
real showing has been possible by the power boys
and muscle builders. However, there is every in-
dication that the irons will get a real play at the
first sign of fair weather.

Real competition is in store for the heavies,
and its anybody’s guess who will be the top man
among Brickhouse, Willis, John Bowers and Billie

Holmes. We did not count Bakey, because he lifts
with the fat part of his muscles. Reds Jordan is
pretty confident he is the light-heavy champ. Felix
Capone accepts all challengers for middleweight
honors. Joe ‘‘The Barber’’ lays claim to the blub-
berweight crown. Before Joe started his muscle-
building course, he looked like the Before on a be-
fore and after picture, now he looks like Before Be-
fore. So far he has only grown muscles on his jowls.

Richard ‘‘Crafty’’? Leroy arrived on Muscle
Beach and astounded everybody with the ease at
which he lifted the barbells. Wait till he finds out
that you have to put weights at both ends of the bar.

BASKETBALL

Of the four teams in the Pen-Cell League,
Reliable A. C., under the management of John
O’Brien, appears to be the strongest.

RELIABLE A. C.

Lacking height, the smooth passing and _all-
around team ability are the keynote of the team’s
success. Reliable’s Captain, Harry Fricker, is de-
finitely the stick-out of the league, scoring 173 points
in 12 games. His play should carry the club to the
championship. Reliable’s hopes were somewhat
dimmed by a leg injury suffered by Jimmie Mc-
Kenna. However, Saby seems to be just the man to
take over Jimmie’s spot.

John O’Brien manages his club with the same
ability that he used in skippering his football squad
to undefeated laurels.

How the team looks to me:

John O’Brien, Mgr. — Backbone

Saby — Real Hustler
; Harry Fricker, Capt. — Leading Scorer

Sports

Billy Hollowell — Hustler
Jimmie McKenna — Floorman
Dick — Sharp Center
John Bowers — Set Shot Artist
Tommy — No. 1 Sub.
Bocco — Team Player
Blackie — Rookie

THE DONS

In second place, a fine team, big, fast and ac-
curate with their ball-handling. I believe the tem-
porary loss of Harry ‘‘Tiny’’ Berry, their stick-
out man, contributed largely to their present won
and lost column. Managed by Woody, they have the
material to make a better showing than their pres-
