view with this man, he would receive my highest
recommendation as to his possibilities for loyalty
and hard work. This energetic, youthful looking
man impressed me tremendously with his determina-
tion to be a successful citizen. As he told me, “I
have to make it as a successful part of society. My
hfe depends on it!” I believe his words and in him.
I would recommend this man as a truck driver, ser-
vice station attendant, or a factory worker. Whom-
ever Shall call upon him, I believe his answer will
not leave the employer wanting. You just can’t

make it too tough for this boy. This cheery indivi-
dual, with a ready smile, makes a pleasant working
companion. No gripes, no moaning, no tears. The
burden he carries is not visible. He carries it, as he
does everything else, like a man. He is alert and
possessed of a keen mind. His vocabulary is not
extensive, but neither is it delinquent. This man
was educated in the school of “hard-knocks”. Here
is the rugged type of man which is such a necessary
component of our society. Wouldn’t life be hell if
our population consisted of only one type and class
of men?

This man’s background has been strewn with
difficulties. However, I believe that he has risen
above these difficulties and can be considered one to
help shoulder the responsibilities associated with
society.

WRITER'S SUMMARY: This youthful, athletic,
pleasant lad has not had much opportunity to live
with society. Incarcerated as a young man, and
still a young man, he has matured rapidly due to
foreed incarceration with older men. Rather than
injure his outlook, I believe that this has helped
him. He does not have the streaks of wildness and
childishness that usually accompany a youth. A
non-drinker, he is a sports enthusiast. Participat-
ing in Basketball and Baseball, he is rated high
athletically. The unassuming demeanor with which
he disports himself is admirable. With the back-
ground that he has acquired in Dental Prostheties,
this young man can be developed into a‘highly ef-
ficient part of a Dental Laboratory.

Inasmuch as he has the responsibility of a de-
pendent, plus the maturing agent he has acquired
in prison, we believe that he shall take his rightful
place in society with an attitude of propriety and
responsibility. A decided advantage in his youth,
indicative of many years of productivity for the
Company who may hire him. The future possibili-
ties and the man’s outlook on life tend to override
any past behavior which has cost him so much. Fur-
ther, he shall be under the jurisdiction of the Pa-
role Board for a considerable length of time. Con-
stant surveillance and guidance shall be a definite
asset to both the man, and the hiring organization.
The recommendation: Excellent future possibili-
ties through understanding and further training.
Conducts himself as a gentleman. Soft-spoken and
amiable. Clean, neat and intelligent. As a sports
enthusiast, has developed sportsmanlike qualities.

confirm information listed on applications. Fur-

that statement!”
