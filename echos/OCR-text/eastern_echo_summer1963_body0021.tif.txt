Reflect upon your past, noticing that when you
harbored these evil thoughts you received like in
return. Try thinking, speaking and doing good,
then notice what happens.

When we finally return to society we must be pre-
pared to begin a new life. Above all, we must
never return to the same conditions and circum-
stances which surrounded us in the past. If we
wish to become decent members of the community,
we must start life anew; a different residential sec-
tion, new friends, new job, everything must be

different.

Insisting upon a return to the old way of life, in all
probability will only mean an eventual return to
prison. This we must never do.

Most penal institutions today, have programs
which enable the men confined in them to obtain a
formal education and receive assistance in under-
standing their problems, as well as trade schools
and other activities which are beneficial toward
preparing the men for their return to society.

These activities were not instituted to create jobs,
but to give us the opportunity to prepare ourselves
so that we may be better prepared to cope with life
and the problems of everyday existence.

While behind these walls we have plenty of time
in which to prepare ourselves for the future. Many

I have often seen fellows on the verge of doing
something to help themselves, when along would
come a right guy telling them they were foolish to
let these people tell them what to do. In effect the
right guy was saying, “Don’t do what they say, do
what I say.”

It is a shame to see how many fellows are swayed
by these and other remarks. They do not realize
the damage they are doing to their lives just to stay
on the good side of a person who hasn't the slightest
concern for them or anybody else. Reject these
people, they mean you no good.

Most fellows in prison have great difficulty distin-

action because they do not contemplate the ultimate
results of their actions. Whenever a decision must
be made which affects your future and the future of
others, all personal feelings must be put aside and
the thing looked at objectively; will our actions ben-
efit us? benefit others? will they harm us? harm

others?

Any course which is detrimental to us or to others
must be rejected, even if it means alienating relations
with our so-called friends. Rkemember, a_ true
friend will never ask you to do anything which will

jeopardize your welfare.

Our future is all we have left, our past has been a
mess and our present conditions are horrible. Who,
in his right mind, wants to spend his entire life behind
concrete walls? If you like prison, by all means
continue your present way of life. If you don’t like
it, then hurry, do something before you are check-
mated. @

‘Ole Murph’ Elevated to Editor

Francis A. Murphy, Echo’s long-time fun-

ny man of wit, humor and satire, was recently
elevated to editor-in-chief by unanimous vote
of captive scribes, who comprise the walled-in
publication’s editorial staff.

“Ole Murph,’” who succeeds Don Gus-
man, recently paroled, chose layout man Fred
Adams as associate editor to bolster a some-
what anemic staff, which is now considered to
be full-blooded, in an effort to restore the edi-

torial prestige the publication previously en-
joyed.

In earlier years, the publication soared to
Canaveral heights and ranked one, two, three
with the Atlantian and Presidio, published for
nearly a half century. Ina recent survey, how-
ever, published by the Saturday Review, Echo
did not even rate an honorable mention in a
field of some 300 publications, while the At-
lantian and Presidio remain at the top of the
heap.

“Ole Murph,” who is part messiah and
part honky-tonk, impelled by a mature mind,
knows crowds don’t follow straight Bach when
it comes to journalism, promises ‘“‘we’ll’’ be
back on top. ”

Sic ‘em Murph!
