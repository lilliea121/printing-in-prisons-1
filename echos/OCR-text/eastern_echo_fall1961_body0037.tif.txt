Tavern team, Don Buckley, who can drive with the
best of them despite his small stature and large girth.
The two Hackett brothers, Larry and Tim teamed up
with Johnny Breese and Don Buckton to give the
Stars a tough time during the first period. The Nar-
beth five got off to a torrid start and had a 35-52 lead
at the close of the first half, but Hasterns fast break
coupled with their own lack of reserves took a heavy
toll on the street men, who saw their lead melt away
and finally disappear in a barrage of field goals. Tim
Hackett, the quiet man, was the high scorer of the
eame with twenty-three points while his brother
Larry had seventeen. Johnny Breese, the scourge of

Buckton. Buekley picked up seven points.

The Cherry Hill team had fourteen of sixteen play-
ers hit the scorers book! Charley Adderly celebrated
his return to the Eastern courts with a fifteen point
spree while Billy Holley was close behind with four-
teen tallies.

Ernest “Lucky” Jackson, teamed up with an out-
sider, “Barrels” Dougherty in one of the better
EFFORTS at officiating that we have seen to date.

FRANCISVILLE CHUCKLES TO VICTORY

Some of the most happy-go-lucky ball players
we've seen, invaded these confines July 30, and
ralked off with a stunning victory over the strongest
team the All-Stars has put on the boards to date.
Roaring to a 10 point lead the visitors put on a dis-
play of ball handling that would have had the Harlem
Globe-Trotters green with envy. Their slap-stick
antics had the Kasterners grinding their teeth in cha-
erin. But as soon as the Cherry Hill five put the pres-
sure on the visitors settled down and began hitting
shots that were out of this world. This was to be ex-
pected as the Francisville five play in one of the

Eastern Echo

toughest summer leagues on the east coast. After
facing men like Wilt Chamberlain, Chink Scott, Guy
Rodgers, Wayne Hightower, ete. the home court five
must have looked like midgets.

Undaunted by their guests attitude, Coach Thomp-
son’s boys played their hearts out. John O’Brien was
his usual capable self, quarterbacking the team, while
Charley Adderly and Shakey Young gave no quarter
on the backboards. Donnie Wise played a. terrific
eame in a losing effort and Billy Holley had the visi-
tors running themselves to death.

Chief thorn in the side of the Hasternites was
Young who was deadly serious at all times and kept
popping in twenty-foot Jumpers with ridiculous ease.
Under the boards for the street team, Harris and
Vandenhunt were bears at clawing the ball off the
taller defenders.

The amazing thing was that Hastern had six men in
double figures and still it wasn’t enough. From the
standpoint of the fans this was the best game of the
year and it is hoped that a rematch will be held in
the near future.

HENNY’S TAPROOM TIES IN TIME

Led by Larry Hackett, Henny’s taproom snatched
a loss back as they sank a basket when the whistle
blew ending the game, and yard-out. Starring for the
outsiders was Sam Feeny, one of last year’s favorites.
Just a little guy in his last years game, Sam is closing
in on the six foot mark, still growing and getting
more skillful with the roundball. Also scoring in a
eoodly manner was D. McAndrew and P. Bruee.

‘or the inside five Charley Adderly was top man
with twenty points while Elijah Sheperd had four-
teen. Al Sheperd and Cochise Bell had ten each and
Bill Holley ended up with eleven markers.

Eastern All-Stars Triumph for Third Stright Win
over Narbeth Quintet as whistle ends game

Proving that to be hospitable you don’t have to
lose, Coach Thompson’s charges again took advan-
tage of their opponents mistakes and walked off with
the laurels as the whistle blew for yard-in, ending a
eame that had started late. Since there were six min-
utes to go the vietory was a little tarnished, but still
a victory.

Leading the attack for the visitors was Bob Thorn-
ton, a new player as far as Eastern is concerned, Ac-
