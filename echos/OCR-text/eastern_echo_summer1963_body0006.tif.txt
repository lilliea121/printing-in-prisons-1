trip mining is a subject on which
much has been written during
the past year, and much will,
no doubt, be written in the fu-

solution to some of the problems now being expe-

math; to offer an idea, if not a solution that will be
acceptable to labor, management, and the prison
authorities.

When coal is mined in this manner, suitable lo-
cations in which to dump the culm or coal too fine to
be marketed, is often difficult to find. This refuse
cannot be deposited in any location until all veg-
etation is cleared from the area, such as trees, logs,
stumps and other vegetable matter. The hazard
of fire is continually present in these culm mounds,
often started by decaying vegetable matter and
spontaneous combustion. The sources of danger
are varied and many, for when strip mining occurs
in the vicinity or neighborhood of small towns or
villages, it gives access to these operations to small
children; this, then, enters into the catagory of ex-

treme danger.

The following is a graphic example of the danger to
life and property of one small community, taken ver-
batim from a local Philadelphia newspaper: “It was
indeed most gratifying to read your editorial en-
titled ‘Strip Mining and Public Safety,’ published
February 24th 1963. It is true! Our very existence
is at stake, and we must make every effort to protect
our lives and properties. Until a strong mine strip-
ping bill is enacted we will always be fearful of re-
peated wash-outs, mud-laden streets, blocked sewers,
creeks and dams and widespread property damage.
We have already experienced this in our town and
the mounds of dirt from the strippings are much
higher now. Above all, there is danger of loss of
life inasmuch as children play nearby.”’ (end of quo-
tation) The article was signed by three citizens of
Plymouth, Penna. The unhealthy sanitation prob-
lem which this condition causes, poses an added haz-
ard to all concerned.

The high costs to the mine operators for re-
moving the coal, (equipment operators, laborers,
etc.) reduces the margin of profit to such an extent
that the mine operators are unable to pay for the

necessary labor and high costs of backfilling. Asa
result the pits and trenches remain deep and open
and have been instrumental in many injuries and loss

of life.

At this particular point, convict labor could be

would possibly amount to approximately $3.00 per
day per inmate; whereas, the cost to employ civilian
labor would be no less than $20.00 per man. If the
mine operators are unable to pay civilian labor wages
for this backfill, then the use of convict labor would
not be taking employment from a free man, in other
words, inmate labor would not be transgressing on
the rights of free labor.

What the organized labor
movement has concerned itself with has been the
nature of the work done by convicts and safeguards
to prevent the product of their labor from coming in-
to competition with the products of free labor, and in
that way undermining the standards and conditions
of work which the free workers have established for
themselves. This position of the American Fed-
eration of Labor has been repeatedly endorsed.

The possibility of a $3.00 remuneration per
day for each inmate could be apportioned to: $1.00
to the inmate, half of which would be placed in a
saving fund to be given to him upon his release, the
other half to be added to his account to be spent as
he sees fit for whatever small luxuries he is afforded.
$2.00 of the $3.00 to be given to the State to ex-
pedite what funds are allotted to the program. The
possibilities are unlimited in this situation, for this is
a co-operative endeavor which enlists the aid of all
who have a stake in the outcome, including the
average citizen who is NOT interested in modern
correctional problems until someone in the family
falls by the wayside. Until we can interest the
public generally, we are fighting a losing battle as

far as rehabilitation programs are concerned.
