Happiness Is Just A Dog Called

The afternoon of February 26th, 1957, Snoopy
donned his ‘‘Press Hat’’ and trench coat and togeth-
er with the members of the ECHO staff met the
representatives of the EVENING BULLETIN, DAI-
LY NEWS and PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER.
Messrs. Morley Cassidy, John Frasca and Joseph
Tractman, in order of papers listed, were on hand.
Snoopy insisted upon taking the notes on the meet-
ing but now, of course, can’t read his own shortpaw.
Fortunately, because of the kind cooperation of the
newsmen and the excellence of their reports and
articles which appeared in their respective papers,
there is little need to recapitulate the facts and
events of the meeting. Elsewhere in this issue (The
Voice of Criminology) is an explanation of some of
the reasoning behind this, the first non-censored
press interview of inmates in Eastern’s history. It is
sufficient to say here that results of this experimental
conference were encouraginely beneficial, and that
there were numerous favorable inquiries and com-
ments. The overwhelming interest and participa-
tion of both inmates and outsiders alike, in the
affairs of this magazine since this meeting, leads us
to believe that we are on the right track in our aims
and policies. True enough, there were some alarm
reactions that such a meeting was allowed to take
place. But these were few, and as Snoopy pointed
out, ‘‘Say, now. We can’t expect to please every-
body. lLet’s just be thankful for the friends we
have made.”’

Snoopy Gets a Degree AT

Recently, Snoopy learned that Rev. J. DeCosta

Harewood was to be specially honored with a degree
by the Philadelphia Divinity School. Fr. Harewood
formerly held Episcopal Services regularly for the
men here, and served under a succession of six War-
dens: McKenty, Groome, Smith, Burke, Tees and
Martin. That represents a span of something like
40 years! During this period, the good Father also
prepared 100 inmates for confirmation and faithfully
served those awaiting execution at both Moyamen-
sing and Bellefonte.

Perhaps Fr. Harewood’s outstanding single
achievement was his rescue of a young woman con-
victed of Murder and sentenced to twenty-five years
imprisonment. Of course, this was a quarter century
ago, at which time women were housed at Eastern.
Funds were solicited in her behalf to pay for legal
representation and, through Fr. Harewood’s efforts,
a pardon was granted.

Ballads, Anyone?

The ballad, ‘‘Down and Out,’’ which appeared
in the EASTERN ECHO Spring Issue carried the
eredit line of Hildridge S. Thompson as author. As
anyone knows,—that is, except the red-faced Editor
... this was not an original piece of work, and al-
though we have not yet been able to track down the
actual source and version, Hildridge assures us that
@) “be did NOT write tt and @) 1 1s a panw.
piece from way back which he could not fully or
accurately remember but which he submitted in the
hopes it would provide entertainment to others. It
seems that his name on the manuscript was intended
as a submitted through, not submitted by. The non-
plussed Editor is out boning up on his poetry, and
