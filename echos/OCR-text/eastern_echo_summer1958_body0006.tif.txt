f the hypothetical advertisements above, were

to appear in our local newspapers, I wonder what
appeal each would have for prospective employers?
Fortunately for Inmates, there are some of our
readers to whom both would have an equal appeal.
Unfortunately, there are too many to whom the
second advertisement would have no appeal. It is
to this group that these words are directed.

Gentlemen, what is it that makes the thought
of hiring a man with a prison record so distasteful?
Can you logically justify your reasoning? Or, do
you use the stereotype phrases, ‘‘ Well, it just isn’t
ther tiie fOndOnes== = lbs as C000 risk y= 2 = Ii
can’t afford to take the chance!’’____‘‘Why should
I hire a man who has turned to crime? He might
decide to do it again!’’__‘‘Read the papers. Every
page you turn to, tells of some ‘‘Parolee’’ getting
into trouble!’’ These are the answers that I hear
daily. And yet, are they reasonable answers? Or,
has adverse publicity and misunderstanding of penal
institutions created this trend of thought?

I think it is important that the general con-
ception, and mental image formed when the word
‘‘eonviet’’? is spoken or read, be immediately de-
stroyed. Having led a normal, socially acceptable
life for a number of years, I am very familiar with
that misconception. I held such opinions. When
I read the headlines ‘‘EX-CONVICT BEING HELD
FOR MURDER!’’, I, too, commented vehemently
against the powers that turned such people out to
recommit crimes. I formed a fallacy in my mind
whenever I heard the word *‘Convict’’, **Parolee’’,
or ‘‘Inmate’’ mentioned. Had I not been placed
into prison for my own misconduct, I would still be
laboring under this unfair, misguided fallacy. ie;

Tom Jones was a Convict.

Tom Jones was a vicious person.

Therefore, all convicts are vicious persons.

As you can readily understand, this is utterly
ridiculous. J live with these so-called ‘‘vicious’’
persons. I eat, sleep, discuss politics, attend church,
participate in sports and listen to the woes, plans
‘and hopes of this group of men who have been

labeled “‘vicious’’ by the general public. It is one
of the most unfair, biased attitudes that man could

take. The larger percentage of these: men are ac-

_ ceptable and likeable. From personal failure, they

have developed an empathy for their fellow man
that far exceeds the quality of empathy imbued in
your fellow citizen. ‘True, there are some men re-
siding behind prison walls who would fit into the
category of being ‘‘unacceptable’’. They are men
who have no gratitude, consideration, or mercy.
Frankly, gentlemen, this type of man also resides in

' your own city. He has never been to prison. How-

ever, the acts and functions of this parasite is the
constant concern of your neighbors and yourself.
But, do you classify your community by the misdeeds
of the minority? JI sometimes wonder if your per-
centage of ‘‘good citizens’’ is as high as our per-
centage of “‘good parolees’’. To familiarize you
with our percentage, allow me to quote some figures
that were printed in one of Philadelphia’s local
newspapers. These figures, printed May 7, 1957, were
compiled by William lL. Jacks, statistician for the
Pennsylvania Board of Parole.

‘¢

“Of the men placed on parole for the year
ending May 31,1956, 88.5% were doing a good job
and maintaining their status in society. This means
that only 11.5% were returned to prison. But, wait!
Of the 11.5% who were returned to prison, 4.9%
went back because they violated the rules of parole!
In most cases, for doing things that would be per-
fectly legal for the rest of society!’’

These figures were based on the total of 5,630
parolees under supervision. Just think, 4,985 of
these men were men who justified the faith of the
parole board’s decision. The picture is much brigat-
er when you add the 278 who went back because of
violation of the rules.

This seems to belie the accepted opinion that
“‘parolees’’ are poor risks. Unfortunately, the ar-
ticle was not “‘headlined’’. Quite the reverse from
the publicity received when a ‘‘parolee’’ gets into
trouble.

Our fourth estate, although real’zing tre ‘‘news-
value’’ of lurid head-lines, has publicly admitted that
newspapers present an unfair picture of the parole
situation. Further, newspapers throughout the
United States hire “*parolees’’ regularly. They print
adverse stories for their ‘‘news-value’’. They want
