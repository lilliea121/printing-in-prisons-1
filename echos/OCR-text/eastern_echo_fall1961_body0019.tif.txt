directed as to be profitable to the state and indi-
vidual.’’ Since those early days many more clauses
have been added. One of great importance is the rule
that requires prison labor to be non-competitive with
outside business. This is a very important point that
even today is misunderstood by many employers and
businessmen alike. Prison labor in effect cannot com-
pete with big business. The production methods are
slower and the machinery is not of the type to keep in
step with the million dollar giants in operation today.
The main function of prison labor is to provide an
education for the men in prison and to provide com-
modities for the state owned institutions and main-
tenance within the particular institution in which the
‘nmates are housed. The small commercial trade
carried on by inmates to private individuals 1S SO
small as not to warrant consideration and much anxi-
ety that seems to plague the uninformed in society.

A work program like other constructive endeavors
is not a stationary task. It is one which must be con-
tinually improved upon to suit the changing times
and the prisoners personal needs and adjustments.
The pay must be adequate in order to assure the in-
mate of a sense of security. Many individuals would
ect a chuckle out of this last statement, thinking in
terms of the state supplying the necessary needs of
the inmate. But, if they realized how many inmates
send part of their meager wages to mothers, Wives
and other members of their families it would appear
a little different. Financial security as far as the pris-
oner is coneerned is the secure knowledge that his
small pittance is helping someone he loves. He is
secure in the knowledge that he can save enough to
aid him in his quest for freedom. He is secure in the
knowledge that he can buy extra tools and books in
which to master the skills of his particular trade.
This coupled with the opportunity, tools and machin-
ery afforded him by the specific prison can give him
a mental security and sense of well being.

The many photographs scattered throughout this
article are not before and after pictures of comple-
tion. They are shown to give those concerned an idea
of the development and re-evaluation of the practical
ideas of progress in action. These are pictures of this
institution and its steps in forming a better and more
productive type of work program. Sometimes the
changes are so slight as to be lost in the total image
of the complete picture. It cannot, however, erase
the soul inspiring thought that opportunities are be-
ing given. One of the main drawbacks in practically
every prison stressing modern ideas is the subjection
of inmates to menial and non-educational types of
labor. These are the jobs that require the personal
cleanliness of the prison, that they serve a good pur-

pose is understandable. The cleanliness of the prison
is all important to the health of the men residing
within. Even these individuals must not be led to
believe that their tasks are useless. And their type
of labor is the end product of their evaluation of
serving time. The science of eudazemonies (Philosophy
of happiness) can also be applied here. The happiness
of man in labor is the individuals feelings about the
specific task he is performing daily. In the world out-
side, this is a point highly stressed.

Many prisons are faced with an over-population
problem. The need to expand industry or reduce the
number of men is a point of consideration. Despite
these hindrances, an attempt to keep the vocational
programs at a steady pace has been rewarding.

One of the greatest problems that confronts prison
personnel today is the so-called short timer. The man
who has maybe 1 to 2 years to serve. The time needed
to train and educate these men is insufficient in re-
eards to the qualifications needed for jobs on the out-
side. There are different points of view regarding
this problem. Many persons seem to think, “‘If the
particular person has only the minute criminal tend-
encies that is a prerequisite to shorter sentences, then
he must have a higher degree of incentive than his
criminal compatriots. ”’

This is nonsensical. Illustrative is the case of Mr.
X who in three short years (1947 to 1950) had been
arrested 18 times and sentenced on every oceasion to
one large city prison. This was of course a county
prison which specializes in 30 days to 3 year sen-
tences. The need to acquaint these men with a type
of labor program and education is quite acute as in
the state prisons. When you realize that thousands
of men inhabit these county prisons then you realize
the importance of the situation. It is only a short step
from 30 days to 30 years.

A few years ago one of the prisons located in
the Philadelphia area had only a farm job activity
and practically no skilled labor in operation. The
only exception was the small craft work the men did
in their cells. This was the only type of work in
which the men received remunerative values (Pay)
for their efforts. It was very difficult to transcend
this obstacle to Modern Penology. Lack of space was
one of the justifiable reasons, and complacency on the
part of prison administrators was the unjustifiable
reason. With the advent of time and more intelligent
reasoning this is being corrected. The progress isn’t
as great as it could be, but all things considered—it
has been an enlightening process. The prisons built
in the 19th century were designed mainly to keep the
men locked up and localized within one specific area
of the prison. That conditions can be improved can
