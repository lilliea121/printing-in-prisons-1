The “Bull Gang’ needs but little introduction
from this writer. Merit always recommends itself;
yet it often happens that some do not perceive the
good qualities of either a person or thing until they
are pointed out for them. Therefore, we call atten-
tion to a few of the features that differentiates this
“Bull Gang’ from others and render it unique and
deserving of honorable mention here.

The exigencies of the work to be done here at
present demand the installation of the useful and
necessary, and the elimination of the useless and un-
necessary. At the same time, the ever present securi-
ty problems must constantly remain in the forefront
of any and all major construction or demolition jobs
inside these walls.

The accelerated works program now in progress
is an all-out effort to save the archaic buildings,
plumbing, underground sewer system, etc., inside
these ancient walls, that are fast approaching their
goal of extinction.

This complex and urgent situation has been placed
in the very capable hands of Captain Joe Roach,
Chief Engineer. Cap’ Roach has formed a personal
philosophy after twenty-two years of handling men
behind these walls: efficiency, responsibility, con-
sistency, plus the know-how, “Treat *em like men,
and they react like men.’ This, in essence, is the
philosophy behind Cap’ Roach and the members of
his ‘Bull Gang.”’

Security is the key word, and Cap’ Roach and the
powers that be are to be commended for their care-
fully selected choice of men who are doing the brute

work inside and OUTSIDE of these ancient forty-

24

foot barriers.

The concensus of opinion would think that only
short timers would be granted the privilege of work-
ing outside the big gate. However, paradoxical:as
it may seem, two members of the “‘Bull Gang’’ have
40 years of continuous time served between them.
Horace “‘Johnny’’ Bowers has 26 continuous years,
and William ‘“Turk’’ Beatty has 14 years on the in-
side looking out. (Brother, Cap’ Roach has proven
a point somewhere along the line with his, ““Treat
"em like men, and they react like men.’’) These two
men alone are enough to be considered a salient dis-

tinction of the “Bull Gang’ and for it to be well

noted; yet, this is but a criterion, a standard for the
entire crew. This six-man crew has a total of 65
continuous years served. Other members of the crew
are as follows: James *‘Fish’’ Fisher, Joseph ‘“Knock-
Knock” Jowett, William “‘Meat’’ Perry, and Claude
“Tampa Red” Dublin. These men have worked, on
numerous occasions, outside the forty-foot barriers
of this institution, with one unarmed overseer, the
genial Mr. Ed. Vanderslice, a long-time member of
the maintenance personnel.

The deportment of these men, inside and away
from the immediate vicinity of this institution, will

-withstand the acid test of the severest criticism of

z

the most skeptical observer.

Another distinguishing feature of this crew con-
cerns the ever-present emergency calls. During the
recent cold wave, a cold water line buried six-feet
