and Cardinals A.C., made their initial appearance of
the season in the heavyweight division opener. They
provided us with sixty minutes of thrill-packed foot-
ball in which each team played equally well. Of
special notice was the fine sportsmanship displayed
by all participants.

It was a game marked with hard running, bruis-
ing line-play and fine defensive play. The final
scores 0:0:

GAME HI-LITES: Deserving of special mention
for their fine play are Charles Adderly, “Pinky”
Andrews and Felix Capone of Reliable, and for the
Cardinals, Dave Croxton, Heads and Billy Holmes.

It seems that everyone has been reading the
rule-book. In the first. quarter “Tookie’ Crane
signaled for a fair catch of a punt, and Lo and Be-
hold, not a hand was laid on him.

Reliable A.C. came the closest to scoring when
O’Brien passed to Adderiy in the end-zone, only to
have an Illegal-Use-Of-Hand penalty nullify the
score.

RELIABLE TOPS CARDINALS 7-6
November 4,—Reliable A.C., despite the massive
Cardinal line, came on strong in the first quarter to
score.

Taking advantage of a fumble recovery by
Capone, O’Brien, directing Reliable from his quarter-
back position, pulled Jake Welty out of the line and
set him in the fullback slot. From this position
Jake barreled over for the first score of the year
for either heavyweight team. An O’Brien to An-
tonoweicz pass was complete for the extra point
which proved to be the margin of victory.

Giving the Reliable backs nightmares, the big
Card line moved in time and time again, led by Joe
Staley, Cardinal right guard. Joe proved to be
Reliable’s biggest headache and the Cardinals’ big-
eest defensive asset.

“Pinky” Andrews, Reliable’s right tackle, cop-
ped honors for his stellar line play while heading up
the charging Reliable’ line. A great performance

Deep inside Reliable territory after a sustained
drive from mid-field, fullback Andrews spun out-
side left tackle on a fourth down play for the Card-

“Heads” was stopped short of the goal-line.
