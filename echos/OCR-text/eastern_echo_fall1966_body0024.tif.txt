There isn’t too much to this story except it might
be amusing to a few of you. But it bugged me so
much, I almost lost my marbles...the rest of them,
I mean. Oh, by the way, I’m Zave Bilkowskovie and
Vm a con... you know, a jailbird. And it all hap-
pened one day at mail call... the bug, I mean.

We just got back to the cell block, after a scrump-
tuous supper af Spanish Rice and Kidney Beans. I
was sitting on my bunk in my eell, rolling a smoke,
‘Billy the Kid’ style, when I heard my name hollered
for mail call. I leaped up and ran for the cell door.
But then I slowed down so I wouldn’t look too anx-
ious. We cons have a little pride too, you know.

I gingerly took my letter from the block hack with
an exaggerated display of casualness, and retraced
my steps back to the sanctity of my cell, with gusto.
I slowly turned the envelope over in my hand, play-
ing my usual little game where I try to guess which
erotic, shapely starlet had written me this time. But,
as usual, it was my monthly letter from mom; bulky
in volume, and written in her strong, heavy slavic
hand. I always know the letter is going to be from

mom, but I play the little game of the luscious broad,

anyway. Why shouldn’t I? A guy’s supposed to
have some pleasures out of life, ain’t he?

In my mind I was asserting my right to day dream
about the statistics “38-23-38,” as I savagely pulled
the letter out of the envelope and unfolded the huge
page. I don’t know where in the hell mom gets her
letter paper, but when I get through spreading it
out, it damn near covers my whole bunk. It takes
me almost as long to get it ready as it does to read
it. Anyway, here’s what she sez...
