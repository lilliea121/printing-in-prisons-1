He should know the types of chords, their
interval construction and representative sym-

bols.
Major: root—major 3rd—perfect 5th (C)

Minor: root—minor 3rd—perfect 5th (Cm
or C)

Diminished: root—minor 3rd——diminished

5th (Cdim. or C°)

Augmented: root—major 3rd—-augmented

5th (C aug. or C+)

Major 7th: root—major 3rd—perfect 5th
major 7th (C maj. 7 or C M 7)

Minor 7th: root—minor 3rd—perfect 5th
—minor 7th (Cm7 or C-7)

Diminished 7th: root—minor 3rd—dimin-
ished 5th—diminished 7th (C dim 7 or C°
7)

He should know the common extentions or
alterations of the above mentioned chords.

Major chords may be extended by adding a
major 6th (C6)

Minor chords may be extended by adding
a major 6th or a major 9th (Cm6 or Cm9)

Minor 7th chords may be extended by add-
ing a major 9th or a major | Ith (Cm9 or

Cm11)

Diminished chords may be extended by
adding a major 9th (C°9)

Augmented chords may be extended by
adding a minor 7th or a minor 9th (C--7
or C+ (-9) )

He should practice the progressions or
changes between chords as they will be found
in solo chord charts. Any good sounding
arpeggiated running of the chord may be
used. These progressions should be practiced
following the cycle of keys or chromatic ex-
ercises. The following examples given are

merely patterns that may be used or adapted:

Practice changes from minor 7th chord to

dominant 7th chord. (Cm/7 to F7)

Practice changes from minor 9th chord to

dominant 9th chord. (Cm9 to F9)

Practice running the dominant 7th aug-

mented I 1th. (C711)

Practice running the incomplete dominant
7th with flatted 9th. (C7-9)
(In this chord no root is used. It sounds

like a diminished 7th chord built on the 3rd

Practice changes from minor 7th to domin-

Practice running all dominant 7th chords

Practice running all dominant 7th chords
with augmented 5th and augmented 11th

He should practice the chord changes men-
tioned above with the scalic passages instead
In order to do this, become
familiar with the scales based on the various

chords.

of arpeggios.

He should become familiar with blues pro-
gressions. They should be memorized in the
common keys where they will usually appear
(C, F, Bb, Eb, Ab, and G). Three sets of
progressions are given here in the key of C.
Each is progressively more complicated, but
they are all basically the same.
