The Worlds Best-Seller

Rey. Frederick H. Goos
Lutheran Chaplain

The Bible is still the world’s best-seller. But
is it also the world’s most widely read book? There.
may be some question about that. Are you reading
it? If the answer is ‘‘no’’, is it because you think
the Bible has no vital message for you? Or is it
because you have not learned how to read the Bible

to derive the greatest benefits from such reading?
: We are forever facing the issues of life. Calam-
ity strikes us. Sorrow overwhelms us. In the midst
of these soul stresses man seeks a sure word of
direction or comfort. These he must have or go down
to defeat and despair. And these he may have if he
will diligently ‘‘search the Seriptures’’.

Life in our modern world is complicated so our
problems are all the more numerous and more diffi-
cult to solve. Instead of having them solved for us
we need guidance and help to work out our own
solutions. The Bible can be a source of such guid-
ance and help. It records many human experiences
and in these experiences we may find the answer
to the problems which confront us.

There is moral and ethical confusion today. The
standards of right and wrong are rather indefinite.
The authority of the home for regulating the con-
duct of its members has become uncertain and
ineffective in many instances. What is needed is
not a code of rules and regulations which outlines
every duty in detail but sign-posts which point out
the way we ought to go. And that is a function of
our Bible. Paul says, ‘‘all Scripture is given by
inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
tiehteousness’’. (11 Tim. 3:16) It is a guide and
standard for everyday living. The Ten Command-
ments are not outdated. They are needed today as
much as they ever were. For indicating the right
direction in life you will find Jesus’ Sermon on the
Mount in Matthew 5, 6 and 7 a masterpiece.

These are but a few examples how the Bible
may help in solving our problems. You will discover
others as you read and meditate.

Let me give you a few suggestions in how to
read your Bible profitably for ‘‘correction and
instruction’’.

1. Before you begin your reading ask God to
help you to understand and believe what
you read.

Read a portion daily. It is the regular, day-
to-day study which makes the Bible your
daily companion and guide.

3. Read it to increase your knowledge, to deep-
en your understanding and to strengthen
your faith. Get help from more informed
students if particular passages are difficult
to understand .

4. Read the Bible to discover your sin and that
you may be led to true repentance and faith.

5. Read your Bible in order to know and love
your Saviour Jesus Christ.

The Very Stones

Rey. Edwin L. Gallagher
Catholic Chaplain

If you don’t remember ‘‘Gabby’’ Hartnett,
then you are a youngster! In the days when
‘‘Gabby’’ used to snap his peg to second base with-
out stirring from his haunches the Cubs amounted
to something. Now that the old catcher has re-
tired to the Hall of Fame, the Cubs have slipped.

The memory of ‘‘Gabby’’ however, lingers on.
He used to entertain with endless humor and spark-
ling wit at various dinners and clubs—even to the
edification of stag smokers where an occasional
lapse from good taste was easily overlooked and
maybe expected. Not so with Hartnett, because the
way he could clean up another’s smutty story was
uneanny. And if he couldn’t clean it up, he for-
got it. Inke Will Rogers, Snozzle Durante and
Fred Allen, he was funny but never filthy,—he
didn’t have to be; he was too clever. It is little
wonder, then, that the former catcher is still in
demand, still entertaining.

It’s good for us to remember a man like
Hartnett. It’s good for us to remind ourselves
that much of the stuff pawned off today isn’t funny
at all—just filthy. And filth is a cheap substitute
for genuine wit. Here no intellect is required
at all and no cleverness. And in the end it leaves
you poorer for having wasted your sense of humor
on drivel. Watch the poverty of the funny-man
who trades in filth, and pity the poor souls who
comprise his egghead audience. It’s a perfect case
of the dull leading the dumb.

Invariably the humor on these levels is sourced
in the unholy use of what God intended to be holy
and reverent, even to the sacred things associated
with the mystery of life and motherhood. A man
has to be mighty low to connect his mother or any
mother with that which is filthy or cheap. Yet it
is done. Do you do it? Sometimes there is need
to be reminded that speech is a gift of God to be
used in His honor and our own salvation. Fun and
filthy talk are not synonymous.

No one wants you to be snooty or soft; but if
you aspire to be any kind of a MAN—vulgarity is
out. The fellow with the filthy tongue hurts him-
self. He harms others—and how much he harms
them he’ll never know until the very last day when
Christ holds the General Judgment. Right now,
when he retails his rot, perhaps someone, terrifi-
cally tempted and trying hard, is pushed into sin.
His own foul mouth in itself is enough to answer
for, without adding another man’s sin— and an-
other’s—and another’s.

Sometimes you can’t escape a dirty story or
talk—but you never have to repeat it. And if you
can’t clean it up, forget it.
