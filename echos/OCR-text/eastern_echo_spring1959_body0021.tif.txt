“Sandra, do try to be patient. Sidi may take
longer than we had thought. In Bhopal, morphine
may be difficult to obtain.”

Sandra’s eyes glittered feverishly, ‘“He’ll never
return, you gave him too much silver. Oh, Stephen,
we should have pushed on to Nagpur.”

Stephen looked at the horses grazing in the
shelter Of the spreadine tree. ~ Too hot,” he de-
clared. “This heat is terrible on you, Sandra. Be-
sides, we’ve driven the horses too far already with-

eyes. After all, she mused, he’s not the one who is

suffering, who has to endure the nerve-wracking

torment. Patience is easy, she concluded, if you
aren’t ill.

“T don’t know why you hired Sidi in the first
place,” she almost shouted. ‘I beg of you, don’t wait
until we get to Caleutta—discharge him in Nagpur.
We won’t need him on the train. If you only realized
how his constant singing disturbs me, and his ugly
face too,—like one of those gargoyles. And he is
always hitting things with that stick he carries.”

“Boomerang, Dear,” said Stephen. “I thought
he rather neatly stopped that king cobra with it,
don’t you agree?”

“Tet me alone!” Sandra shouted. The sound
echoed from the hills. The hum of the nested bees
swelled suddenly to a deep organ tone. Stephen
stared across the ravine at the dark-gray nests. The
terrible bees of Maha Dayo. He had once seen a
specimen of this rare bee. In each of those nests,

lived thousands of these bees, each one as big as a
man’s thumb.

Stephen turned to his wife. “Sandra girl, do
try to rest. .Domt fret. Drink your tea: Sidi wall
bring the medicine soon, ’m certain.”

Sandra sipped her tea with no further comment,
only her big velvet-brown eyes betraying her inner
turmoil. She even managed a wan sort of smile for
her husband. Ul as she was, the smile lighted up her
face and accentuated her appeal. For Sandra was
truly beautiful. Stephen Gaylord smiled back and
took her pale hand in his and pressed gently.

Three miles away, Sidi, on a bone-tired horse,
plodded steadily along through the arid dust. Little
dust devils popped up as the hooves beat out a steady
rhythm. The rider, garish and grotesque, moaned a
weird refrain in Hindustani which sometimes
changed to Punjabese. The sinking sun beat hotly
in his gnarled face, glinted metallically on his green
and orange pantaloons and blouse. in the once-white
turban, glass gems of large size gleamed daully.
Around his ample middle a crimson sash held fast
a hunter’s boomerang. Unlike the ordinary light
throwing stick, a plaything, this was a heavy, curved
stick of polished teak; a deadly weapon, used by the
wild tribes of the Indian hills.

The little, fat servant sang in a low voice now,
for he was riding alongside the gorge which housed
the irritable bees. Sidi, tired and hot, knowing he
had but a small distance to go, pulled up in the
shade of a wild fig tree and plucked some of the
purple fruit. Munching on the soft cool figs, he
suddenly spied five riders approaching on the road
which led to where he sat under the tree. The riders
came along swiftly and almost noiselessly. Sidi stiff-
ened in alarm. Only the hard-riding bandits of the
hill country rode in that manner.

“Ride, Sidi, ride,” a voice within him exclaimed.
But Sidi checked the sudden impulse. The bandits
would overtake him before he could reach the next
bend. From this distance, a warning cry could never
reach his master.

The bandits reined up beside the fig tree. Sidi
recognized the chieftain and greeted him in Hindu-
stani.

“Ho, Surama, what brings you to the lonely,

profitless hills of Maha Dayo?

Surama, black-bearded and beady eyed, scowled
darkly. He stared down the road for a moment be-
fore he looked again at the fat little servant in the
gaudy apparel. “Your Master, little one, and Mem-

sahib—where?”

Sidi waved a hand southward. “They already
long time now, in Nagpur. I go now, back to Jubbel-

pore,” he answered.

The bandit chief scrutinized the bland, saffron
face with the hooked nose, the onyx-like eyes, the
linear mouth, learning nothing from the mask Sidi
