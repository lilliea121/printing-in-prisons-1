The Christian will always be the greatest argu-
ment for Christianity. The early Christians out-
distanced their Greek Masters, not because they out-
argued them, but because they outlived them. Truly
a picture of good in action is better than 10,000
words.

The message of Paul the Apostle was conspicu-
ous for its power; for the first time in history a reli-
gious philosophy was proclaimed that carried with
it life changing force. Here was a system of belief at
long-last that worked.

History states there was a time when the in-
habitants of the British Isles were the most barbaric
and savage of all the races. The Annals of Caesar’s
Tenth Legion convey a graphic picture of those rude
days when our Anglo-Saxon ancestors went into
battle naked, and celebrated their victories by drink-
ing the blood of a slain enemy out of an empty skull.
At the altars of the Druids human sacrifices were
offered. What changed all this? The Missionary
came along with his Message and His Bible.

I have yet to have a man approach me and say,
“Reverend, I have just finished reading this book on
Mathematics and thanks be to this wondreful sci-
ence I feel like a new man.” Nor has anyone made
any corresponding claims for books on Geography,
History, Philosophy, Astronomy, ete. However,
hosts that no man can number, multitudes that no
statistician can count, have expressed a strong con-

viction and a positive declaration that the Christian
faith, as expressed in the Bible, has been responsi-
ble for their singular change in character.

The dynamic responsible for this amazing trans-
formation in thousands of lives the world over is
found in the unique relationship the believer sus-
tains to the Author of the Christian religion. When
you join a club you do not become a part of the
President. When you matriculate at college you do
not become one with the Professor of Biology. When
you elect the President of the United States you do
not share his blood or partake of his life, nor he of
of yours. However, every Christian is a member of
the Body of Christ, “Bone of His Bones and Flesh
of His Flesh”. Christ not only lives WITH us, He
lives IN us. The Church is the only organization in
the world in which the membership partakes of the
life of the Founder and King. He, living His life in
us, provides the power.

How ean I be happy? Every inmate wants the
answer to that question. It is the most fundamental
drive within man. Indeed, all other urges are sec-
ondary to this one. It poses a special problem in
prison. No one in his right mind enjoys doing
“time.” But there is a way to master that time and
have it serve even as a blessing in disguise. It’s not
what happens to us in this life that matters so much,
but rather how we react to what happens.

The secret of happiness in prison is a perfect
resignation to the will of God. Have a true sense of
values—accept reality. Consider the past only as a
means of profiting from the mistakes—think of the
present and the future.

Where can happiness be found? To answer that
we have to consider the makeup of man—a ereature
composed of body and soul. Those who glorify the
body seek material food—money, success and pleas-
ure—but their appetites are not satisfied. The mil-
honaire seeks more money; the successful business
man envies his more successful neighbor; the sen-
sualist becomes a frustrated neurotic. The spirit
also has its needs and hunger,—the soul must be
nourished.

Genuine happiness can be found only in the
practice of religion. Here the mind comes to a quiet
resting place. Only here can we think in terms of
infinite perfection, almighty power and eternal hap-
piness. It was the realization of this truth which
caused St. Augustine, after tasting all that flesh pots

of Carthage and Rome could offer, to ery out; “Our
hearts have been made for thee, O’God!—and they
shall not rest until they rest in thee.” Solomon in
his. wisdom voiced the same truth; “Vanity of vani-

ties, and all is vanity.” Only be recognizing the ab-

solute obligation to adore God and love Him and

serve Him can we achieve satisfaction.

What about the practice of religion in prison?
Certainly, there is ample opportunity to attend the
various services. This is the least one should do.
However, attendance should be prompted by sincere
motives and not merely to make an impression. ‘Of
course, there are those who ridicule the chapel-goers
and tag them as hypocrites. A weak defense for
their own hypocrisy—deceiving themselves and try-
ing to deceive God. One can never have true joy
until he puts his trust in the unchangeable Friend,—
the God of merey, justice, compassion, tenderness
and love.
