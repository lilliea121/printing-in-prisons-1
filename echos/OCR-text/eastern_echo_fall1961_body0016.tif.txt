The executive beamed at the neatly dressed job
applicant. “All right, Carter,” he said, “you start
with us Monday—$6500 a year.”

Carter smiled nervously. “Thanks, Mr. Green. But
there’s something else you should know. [ve just
finished serving four years for forgery.”

Green said, “Vim sorry, but company policy pre-
vents—” There was a moment’s embarassed silence.

“T realize your position, sir,” Carter said, “but be-
fore you write me off, please make one phone call.”

Green dialed the number Carter gave him. For
several minutes he listened. When he hung up, he
nodded ab Carter, . Youve cot the job, he said. 1
eouldn’t say no to the angel in your corner.”

The “angel” was 52-year-old Robert R. Hannum,
who runs one of the most unusual employment agen-
cies in the world. As Director of Vocational Place-
ment for the Osborne Association, a private prisoners-
aid organization with headquarters in New York
City, he finds jobs for ex-prisoners.

A former convict finds himself quarantined from
many kinds of honest jobs. His record bars him in

peacetime from the armed forces, and may disqualify
him for Civil Service. A dozen states refuse him a
driver’s license, making him ineligible for jobs that
require a car or truck. In many states a parolee must
inform a prospective employer of his criminal past
during the first job interview. When he applies to a
firm which has a Government contract, the security
check of his fingerprints reveals his record. It’s not
surprising that about 40 per cent of ex-prisoners re-
vert to crime.

Working to keep them straight are prisoners-aid
societies. The Osborne Association, one of the fore-
most, combines two agencies established by the late
Thomas Mott Osborne, the pioneering warden of Sing
Sine who devoted his life to changing society’s treat-
ment of criminals. During the last 25 years the As-
sociation has suceeeded in finding employment for
some 15,000 ex-prisoners.* Of these only 14 have be-
trayed their trust.

Each morning Director Hannum?’s office is full of
job-seeking ex-safe-crackers, pickpockets, automobile
thieves, bad-check artists, con men. On the surface
they look like poor job risks, but Hannum’s screening
technique is so reliable that some of America’s
strictest bonding companies will bond ex-prisoners
vouched for by the Osborne Association. Seven out
of ten men who show up at Osborne are accepted for
placement, and jobs are found for about 20 every
week.

Hannum first reviews their prison dossiers. To the
top of the ladder go first offenders, men with a good
behavior record, trusties and those who volunteered
as medical guinea pigs. First-rune candidates also
include “graduates” of prison trade schools who are
competent in bricklaying, plastering or other skills.

On the bottom rung are habitual offenders and men
with bad discipinary reports. To these risky charac-
ters Hannum has set his sights low and is thankful
when he can land them minor jobs. Obviously hard
cases such as psychopaths, dope addicts and aleohol-
ies are referred to rehabilitation agencies.

Hannum has the ability to melt employers who
freeze up when an applicant informs them of his
prison stigma. I was in his office when an employer
phoned about an ex-convict the agency had sent him.

“Every security agency in New York knows about
us and considers us good business,” Hannum told
him. “Before I sent the man to see you I got facts
about your company. I believe you'll find him a real
asset.”

“But will he stay straight?” the employer asked.

“We've been in business 25 years, and we’re pre-
pared to guarantee the quality of our product. We
don’t operate on guesswork. We have verified facts
about. the man’s background. habits and personality
which convinee us that hell be an excellent risk de-
spite the blot on his record.”

* The Association places men from federal prisons and all
state prisons except New York’s; the latter are helped by the
New York State Prison Association.
