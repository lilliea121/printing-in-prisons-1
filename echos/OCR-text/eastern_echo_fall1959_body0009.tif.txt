News,” to anyone who asks for it. After digesting this material—in the form of
brochures, reports and statistics—you realize, as one of our literary friends puts
it, “this is one man who had no time to write casual articles.” Therefore, the
writer is more than pleased to “ghost” this invaluable benefactor at considerable
length.

Accordingly, publication after publication seeded and sprouted others during
the early 1900’s. In the decade of 1910-1920, at least 11 more publications were
added to the early pioneers. The growth of modern penology eased restrictions in
many areas, and 19 more periodicals were in circulation by 1930, including the
forerunner of Eastern Echo, the defunct PENPOINT.

Then with hare-like frequency, the next four years produced 45 more publi-
cations. By 1935, at least 127 institutions were publishing newspapers, magazines
and periodicals. Among the then late arrivals were such erstwhile member-publi-
cations as tine MIOIN Tal WY IRiCORID, Commectictis WINE WIZOIUN ID, New Jerseys
RAIFORD RECORD of Florida, probably the first voice of the South.

However, the ensuing war years, according to our source, “gave to the more
crochety or unconvinced administrators excuses they needed to kill paper after
paper,” that, until 1945, of some 300 national and state penal and correctional in-
stitutions, only 85 were publishing. Behind this mortality rate lies a great deal of
confusion and skepticism about the purposes and values of such publications. “Like
any other science seeking the truth in the intangibles of human nature,” the librar-
ian explains, “penology makes progress in a tentative, hesitant, groping fashion.
Not the theorist,” he declares, “but the hard-headed administrator determines what
inmates may do, and it is among the practical men that doubts are found.”

After giving several examples—pro and con—Mr. Spector explains that there
are as many and varied opinions as there are prisons, ranging from complete ap-
proval of publication to flat rejection.

In any event, the post-war era experienced a flood of social unrest within the
American prison system, and it was the theorist who was called upon to stem the
tide of prison revolts, riots and escapes. Old penological concepts were thus forced
to give ground to the new, and some areas experienced many revolutionary changes,

ranging from complete overhaul of antiquated penological systems to the estab-
lishment of new, modern minimum security institutions. Of the latter, the Chino
institution in California, and Segoville of the Federal system at Segoville, Texas,
are perhaps the most popular prisoner-rehabilitation centers in the world today.

Thus, with the advent of modern penology, the number of prison scribes and
publications grew in enormous proportion. Even the more backward prisons—
with few exceptions—welcome this type of occupational therapy as a far safer out-
let for inmate emotions than rattling steel doors and howling in the night. There
is also another important factor worthy of a moment’s attention. That is, no writer,
however inarticulate he may be, can write of his fellow-man and all that environs
him, without seeing the transparency of his own faults!

Following in O. Henry fashion, the more articulate inmates have turned their
backs on the felon’s world, and have begun to look far beyond prison walls for in-
spiration, as Bob Patterson, formerly of the Atlantian—a member publication—
advised them to do: “The factual description of prison life is limited of literary
possibilities and can easily become drab and sordid. The real story is not what men
do in the world of crime or prison; it is what life does to them. There is more
drama in one thinking man’s thoughts than in all the gunplay and bravado of under-
world bibliography.”

Thus heeding this advice, the works of prison authors have adorned the pages
of various commercial publications, ranging from pulps to slicks. Among the best
paying markets to admit prisoners to their pages are such magazines as the Ameri-
can Mercury, The American Weekly, (newspaper supplement) Argosy, Cavalier,
Saga and True. Of these publications, H. L. Mencken of The American Mercury,
in his pugnacious challenge to the bluenoses, was the first editor to open the pages
to prisoners whose work could meet the standards of the magazine. Out of the
mass of manuscripts which cluttered his desk, “only a few acceptable ones appeared,
chiefly the work of [ernest Booth and Robert Tasker, both of whom were inmates
of California prisons. According to Mr. Spector, both have since had books pub-
lished. The former wrote “Stealing Through Life,” and the latter published “Grim-
