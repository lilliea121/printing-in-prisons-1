“We don’t want no ex-convicts in
eur town, mister. So if ya know what's
good for ya, you'll pack up and get
out, or we'll see that you get sent back
where ya belong. Don’t see why that
old fool Spinelli took ya on in the first
place.”

That’s what young Flint told me
when I went into his hardware store
to buy three pounds of 114 inch alum-
inum nails and twenty yards of chicken
wire. There were about eight or ten
townspeople in the store at the time,
and although they remained silent,
their once friendly faces turned to
stone. J] completed my purchase and
left the store without a word, except
for a “thank you.” It wouldn't do for
a paroled convict to engage in any
hostilities with UPSTANDING CITI-
ZENS, especially in their own baliwick.

I was stunned. How did Flint find
out, and why should he be a monkey
on my back. He was one of the wealth-
iest citizens of Templeton, with sever-
al valuable real estate holdings. He
had every reason to be benevolent, and
yet he was openly hostile to me, in a
select group. | knew that for obvious

reasons | would certainly avoid Mr.

Flint.

I usually stop at the diner and have
a cup of coffee and a chat with Mar-
cia, but today I decided to head right
back. When I arrived at the farm, I
took the wire and nails out to where
Mr. Spinelli and I were building an ex-
tension to the already quite long chick-
en coop.

Nick (Mr. Spinelli insisted | call him
Nick shortly after I came here) had
selected me from a group of tentative
parole cases who, at his request, wrote
a short essay: “Why I Would Like To
Work On A Chicken Farm.” | didn’t
know it was a job contest when they
requested we write the essay in the
prison school. I was flabbergasted
when the prison officials told me I had
a job here when I made parole, if I
wanted it. The only thing I knew
about chickens was that they lay eggs
and tasts good, fried. Well, in the
seven weeks I've been here, I’ve learn-
ed a lot more about chickens and eggs.
I had even begun to feel quite happy
and contented here.

I told Nick what had happened at
Flint’s store and suggested to him that
I leave the farm, and Templeton. He
said ‘“‘No, Tom, you-a stay. I no want-
a you should-a go. You like-a my son,
now. Never mind-a what-a Flint-a
say, he no make-a da trouble for me
or-a you. Please-a Tom,’ (Incidently,
my name is Thomas Randall) “you
stay-a with me. You like-a my son.”
He was almost in tears.

Il was touched by Nick’s display of
emotion. [| didn’t realize he felt this
way, and I did like the old man and
the farm; also, Templeton and Marcia.
Especially Marcia. So I told Nick I
would stay despite Mr. Flint. I would
merely avoid him, and maybe it would
all pass.

The following day was Sunday, Mar-
cia’s day off. We had made plans to
drive to Newell, the County Seat, to
take in the County Fair. Boy, she
looked stunning in her starched blouse,
pleated skirt, and wide brimmed pic-
ture hat. Marcia already knew about
me, so I didn’t feel awkward with her.
I told her about my episode with Mr.
Flint, and my talk with Nick, and how

confused [ was.

“IT think you should know this,” she
said. ‘‘My sister Stella worked for Ed
