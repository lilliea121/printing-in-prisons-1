ing 532. 76 or 14% died in prison, 59 or 11% were
transferred to the Hospital for the Criminally In-
sane, and 113 or 21% are still serving time at this
institution. In other words, 46% of the men have
not seen freedom since their sentencing. Not all
murderers are immediately released to run the
streets, as some newspapers would have you believe.

And what of those who are paroled? Of the
original group of 532, 284 were paroled as of this
printing. Only 21 or 7% have violated the terms of
their parole and been returned to prison. A further
breakdown demonstrates that of the men convicted
between 1940 and 1950 and subsequently released on
parole, none have been returned as violators.

Murder is not a pattern or a way of life as is the
ease of other types of crimes, except for the pro-
fessional killer, who if convicted usually dies in the
electric chair. Murder is a ghastly expression of
atavistie violence, but it is only a fraction of the
total sum of actions which go to make a man. Just
as any man may kill, so may some murderers be re-
deemed without fear that they will once again attack
another member of society. As stated by Warden
Joseph E. Ragan, Statesville Prison; ‘*Hixperience
shows that murderers are the best parole risks.
They are most responsive to reform and rehabilita-
tion programs.

The writer does not advocate the eventual re-
lease of all murderers, but he does sponsor the argu-
ment that each murderer has the inherent ability
to become onee more a worthwhile member of society,
and that he has the moral right to be judged accord-

ing to what he has accomplished during his prison —

term rather than by what he did to be sentenced to
prison.

“The defendant is sentenced to the Hastern
State Penitentiary to undergo imprisonment for the
balance of his natural life.’’ This was the pro-
clamation of the judge at the completion of the
writer’s trial. It was an act of merey—it could
have been death. It will remain an act of mercy
only so long as I am allowed to retain hope for
eventual release. Take away that hope and it will
equal the inhumane and immoral act that I com-
mitted in taking a life. This does not mean that I
am callous, unremorseful, or unaware of the hein-
ousness of my crime. Remorse, if undisplayed pub-
licly, has created within me a sense of self-contempt,
a loss of self-pride as a human being which is held
in check only by thoughts of future redemption upon
my eventual release. However, such penitential
emotions have not swayed my reasoning that lfe
must have a purpose to be worth living. Am I to
spend the remainder of my days in a cage regardless
of any changes in my character, spirit, and being?
If so, repeal your act of mercy, and put me to death.

As the dictates of Moses were tempered by a
greater teacher, Jesus Christ—‘‘Ye have heard that
it hath been said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth

for a tooth;’ but I say unto you, that ye resist not
evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right
eheek, turm to him the other also...’ —=so should
society restrain its rightful desire for vengeance in
any thoughtful consideration of the questions in-
volved in the commutation of a life sentence. “El
