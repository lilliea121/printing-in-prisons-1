In Summation

by Andre L. Paschedag

“There has been a clear need in Pennsylvania for fact and considered opinion
regarding pardon and commutation of sentence. Many have been confused by the
charge and counter-charge of legislative inquiry and the emotional exchanges in the

press.’—The Prison Journal

On the preceding pages we have presented the
views of people directly concerned with commutation
either because of their official positions or, in the case
of the prisoner, because of its effect upon his future.
It has been our intention to clarify for our readers
both the facts and the personal issues involved, elim-
inating the confusion of such emotional exchanges
as referred to by the Prison Journal.

It seemed to our staff that the majority of the
people, both pro and con, who spend much time areu-
ing the subject of commutation, have no real know-
ledge concerning the same. This is particularly evi-
dent in the many public references to “paroles
oranted by the Pardon Board,” and “commutations
approved by the Board of Paroles.” Such misconcep-
tions of the proper functions of the two Boards must
be sorrowfully regarded when held by the general
public. When held by persons of authority who are
capable of throwing legal weight behind their argu-
ments, these misconceptions are to be feared by all
concerned.

Why is commutation necessary? Caleb Foote,
Professor of Law, writing in the Prison Journal, gave
the answer as follows: “Although the vast changes
which have taken place in the last seventy-five years
in criminal corrective procedure and in treatment
policy and practice have greatly reduced the neces-
sity of reliance upon executive clemency as a correc-
tive process, they have had relatively little direct
impact on the structure of American pardon pro-

“Even though the absolute discretionary power
of the executive has often resulted in abuse of power,
few would question the importance of having such a
safety valve for the administration of justice. We
have abundant statistical evidence of the inequities
of criminal sentencing which have plagued our pro-
cedure for centuries, and at least some of the grossest
abuses which result have been ameliorated at the
pardon level. The fiexibility of the power has per-
mitted adjustment to changing tastes in crime pub-
licity and retribution. Courageous executives have
flown in the face of temporary public hysteria to curb
some of its excesses, and when the passage of time
has tempered public opinion the pardon power has
enabled criminal administrative policy to conform to
the changed climate.”

In addition to being a safety valve for the ad-
ministration of justice, commutation is for inmates
amore personal safety valve. The very fact that such
a thing as pardon power exists offers a ray of hope
and a means of retaining their sanity to those hope-
lessly buried beneath an unscalable mountain of time.
Well-behaved lifers and others with long sentences
do not behave only because of institutionalization,
but also because they are working towards a goal—
commutation. Whether or not their goal is realistic-
ally attainable is not important. Its importance les
in the sole fact that it exists!

Professor Foote’s reference to the possible ad-
justment of the pardon power to changing tastes in
crime publicity and retribution is a very importapt
