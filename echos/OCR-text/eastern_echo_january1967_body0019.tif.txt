fashioned plush mattresses for Bo and myself out
of elk hides stuffed with fresh pine needles. As a
tyro at this sort of thing I took all the time I needed
and was very proud and satisfied with the results of
my humble craftmanship.

I even toyed with the idea of installing electrici-
ty by utilizing the power of the small waterfall with
the generator and battery from the truck, but aban-
doned it for practical purposes. The truck’s radio
receiver was not powerful enough to pick up the
sending waves from the nearest radio transmitter,
and the cabin’s central coleman lamp provided all
the light I needed when nightime came.

The cabin had a sod roof and was delightfully
cool in the summer months and comfortable, warm
and cozy during the long, cold and snowy winters.
To my delight the fireplace draft worked perfectly,
and the huge, dry oak logs burned slowly and even-
ly. For added insurance against the elements | also
hung animal skins on the walls and covered the
hard, clay floors with more hides to hold the cabin’s
warmth against the hoary outside.

Oddly enough loneliness did not become a
mental burden to me, as practically all my day-
light hours were used productively. There were al-
ways the oak logs to be sawed and split to fireplace
size, additions and repairs to the cabin itself, and
care of the garden and grounds. The canning of
meats and vegetables and berries with the mason
jars I brought along were also time consuming.
Then there was the fishing, hunting, trapping and
day trips of exploring, along with making and
repairing traps, snowshoes and skis. And, of course,
out of necessity, my favorite hobbies. The making
of bows and arrows and my all-weather buckskin
clothes. But even with the seemingly endless load
of chores, there was always ample time for reading
from my modest library and writing an account of
my days in the wilderness. Not to forget the leisure-
ly comfort of just plain loafing. All in all I was per-
fectly satishied with my lot, and content to be in this
capacity, interminably.

For a period of several minutes the plane circ-
led an area not far from where my cabin stood. |
was quite puzzled by this maneuvering, because as
far as | knew, I was the only human being in this
vast area, and no one, not even my rental agent or
tax accountant knew of my final destination. Nor did
I for that matter.

Suddenly I heard the single engine cough
repeatedly, and then sputter and die. The small

craft went into a slow, gliding descent and finally
disappered completely behind the high wooded
hill, about a quarter of a mile from where I was
standing. I cocked an ear, listening for the splinter-
ing crash that was sure to come, but heard nothing
but the usual sounds of the woods. The strange epi-
sode stunned me for a few moments, but with a
quick recovery Bo and I trotted off in the general
direction | had seen the plane vanish behind the
the screen of towering trees.

In a short time we reached the approximate
area and saw that the forest floor was strewn with
pieces of broken branches and bits of twisted wreck-
age. I couldn't see the plane at all, but I did smell
hot oil, torn metal and alcohol fumes. The area was
thickly wooded and very dusky, even though it was
early in the day with the sun shining brightly. By
chance it was the burning sting of hot oil dropping
on my arm from the upper branches of a hugh oak
that made it possible for me to locate the wreck
without searching through the murkiness. With prac-
ticed climbing I reached the plane high up in the
branches of the great tree, where it oddly nestled in
the thick, sturdy foilage. The craft was very badly
damaged, showing gaping holes where the wings
and tail assembly had been. However, despite the
battering plunge, the fuselage was still intact. |
could just barely see the pattern of descent, where
the plane had drifted into a group of tall redwoods,
was buffeted about by these titans and then dropped
into the outer reaches of the soft oak, cutting a
swathe to its bosom.

The pilot was slumped over the controls, and
as | wrenched open the cabin door, the acrid stench
of alcohol fumes overwhelmed me A _ hurried
glance revealed a puzzling litter of broken whiskey
bottles on the floor of the plane. My first impres-
sion was that the pilot was badly hurt, from the
position of the grotesquely twisted body, and also
from the heavy flow of blood from several cuts.
When I removed the flier’s gory cap to spot check
for furthed head wounds, a flare of silky, bobbed
raven hair popped out. | was startled but believing,
when a more intimate probing into the eerie semi-
darkness of the cabin gave evidence to absolute
feminine features. The pilot was a woman!

I gently eased her out of the wreck by rigging
a harness from the thin, tough rawhide rope I always
carry. Then with an extremely cautious effort,
because of the possible gravity of her injuries, |
tediously lowered her to the ground. There, upon
closer examination, she had a long, deep cut on the
back base of her scalp that bled profusely, but the
rest of the scattered lacerations on her head and
and body were superficial. My inexperienced hands
