pails. He would think of his and try to guess at
its contents. Usually he would have a thinly-but-
tered meat sandwich, a hard boiled egg with a pineh
of salt neatly wrapped in a small piece of waxed
paper, some pickle relish, and a cut of jelly roll he
had seen on the pantry shelf the night before.

But lunch was still a long way off. There
would be no recitations before the mid-day. There
was always time to thumb through the lesson books.
Arithmetic and grammer he shoved aside with scant
serutiny.: He would do them only as a duty—like
the nightly walk to bring home the cows. But he
lingered with quickened attention over the litera-
ture—much of it already familiar to him. Count
Leo Tolstoi’s ‘‘War and Peace,’’ Bunyon’s ‘‘Pil-
erim’s Progress’’ . a story of doom and de-
liverance that always brought a lump to his throat.

He paged idly through the history book. There
was one place he had not noticed before and as he
read it through, he found his pulse beating faster
and faster. Then he read it again, whispering to
himself many of its rich, rolling passages. It was
Webster’s ‘‘Reply to Haynes.’’ That majestic plea for
the preservation of the Union. To him, already the
Union was a simple and solemn reality, for he had
devoured all the history and biography available to

him. The land of the people, the stern and rock-
bound coast of New England, the vast expanse of
hill and countryside, all indelibly etched in his mind.
Pictured in his mind, too, was the famous Massa-
ehusetts Bill of Rights—‘‘A government of laws

Through the weeks ahead he returned to the
oration again and again, until it was etched into his
memory. Often he felt that the spirit of Daniel
Webster—born not many miles away—looked over
his shoulder in encouragement. Someday he was
eoing to become a great orator ..alawyer.. -finally,
but surely, a statesman.

Frequently on his way home after school he would
steal out into the woods. From a stump, he would
plead cases to the listening leaves. In a glistering
pine he saw the stern visage of the judge. Gnarled
branches became the faces of the jury. At last he
would trudge with reluctant feet back through the
field to the inevitable chores that awaited him at
home. What a degrading contrast from the fine
frenzy that possessed him in the woods! Must life’s
dream always dissolve into drudgery?

Sunday afternoons, too, he spent in the woods.
Ile was never happier than when the trees were
flaunting their gold and scarlet banners, when a haze

crept into the hollows of the hills, when the birds
were streaming south. Winter might be staking its
claims in the brown earth, but the pyres of the
leaves were still blazing defiance. In all this tessel-
lated sweep of color his heart was like a rhyme, ‘‘ with
the yellow and purple and the crimson keeping time.’’

He always felt things deeply, sorrows and joys
alike. He was too shy to completely adjust himself to

the rough-and-ready pattern of life at school. Too
often the careless jibes of his playmates would send
him shrinking timidly back to his desk, to sit there,
head resting in his hands, staring at the initials
earved by the jackknives of boys, gone generations
before. Had they, too, known sorrows and slights
and sufferings?

At times, he was downeast at his inability to
solve the enigmas of life and death. Someday, he
told himself, all would be clear. Someday he would
find the founts of happiness; someday he would learn
the secret of all the beckoning beauty in field and for-
est. He would know why high tides of bliss flooded
the human heart and then receded into the still sea
of memory. He would discover how man, born to
dream beyond all the hopes of earthly fulfillment...
was able to carry on with indomitable courage until
his body was at last sealed in a house roofed with sod.

But as the years passed him by .. . that day

somehow had never come...

The forlorn figure twitched slightly, and the
half-hard smile became a straight line upon the sunken
face. The stillness was broken by the brassy blare
of a trumpety voice as it pushed the words through
the wicket of the door of cell 44.

‘“oetreadyferexercise!!’’ ‘‘gerreadyferexercise!’’

The morning, still dark with left-over night,
slyly poked its head above the narrow slot of the cell

window, spotlighting the thin figure on the cot. He
is alone, his head cocked at an angle, as if listening
intently.

The world stands still, except for the blood
surging through his arteries and pounding in his
head. An icy coolness comes over him. All his
years flash by ... the first sip from the hired hand’s
bottle, the bitter-sweetness of the golden nectar. The
