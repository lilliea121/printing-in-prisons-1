by myself, as Editor No. 3. However, before the
final press run, I was officially demoted as ‘‘too radi-
eal.’’? Again, to Joe Corvi’s credit, that he came back
to assume the responsibility for this issue, yet PUB-
LISHED IT UNCHANGED, ALLOWING EVEN
MY EDITORIAL TO STAND. The point thus quiet-
ly made, was nonetheless as courageous as any Corvi
stand. Within a matter of weeks, Corvi again re-
signed and yet again in defense of what he clearly
felt to be the just functioning of a prison editor.
This time, the matter related to himself and he re-
quested other inmates not to join forces with him.
Once more this editor cued on, this time under a
different atmosphere for me personally, provided
by a new administrative head of the institution. And
this time, to issue the Winter of ’56 through Winter
of ’57 issues before...

Culp and staff founded ECHO (its second) and
gave the Word; Corvi and staff established and
broadened the magazine and, I believe, kept the
Word. These were troubled times.

As the third editor in this two year history with
which we are concerned, I had all the luck:

In inheriting such a tradition for which great
sacrifices had been made

Having a more experienced as well as won-
derfully loyal inmate staff and group of writers

Enlightened censorship

By the time I returned to the editorship, in that
brief period much deep and searching staff discus-
sion had taken place. As a whole we began to
achieve a grasp of magazine organization and we de-
bated long hours how ECHO could most forcefully
and best secure and advance its ‘‘inmate-centered-
ness.’’

Prior editorial policy had been very good, but
very young. And somehow we were aware of our
erowth. We felt the time had come to ‘‘privately’”’
codify that policy. The privacy of the venture
served, and was intended to serve, this purpose:
never fully revealed, we could not run the risk of
‘‘defining’’ ourselves as to become a school of
thought incapable of further growth and engaged
in defending its position without regard for new
insi¢ht.

A part of this policy operated to keep all pages
of ECHO (Warden’s and Chaplains’ pages excepted)
inmate written and slanted, the products of our own
suggestions and judgments. Format and content
formula never left our hands. All planning, writing,
rewriting and editing was kept exclusively inmate.
ONLY AFTER APPEARANCE OF OUR ISSUES
WAS CIVILIAN AND PROFESSIONAL TECHNI-
CAL CRITICISM SOUGHT. Thus to our last issue,
Winter of ‘57, ECHO was entirely inmate directed,

EASTERN ECHO

written, edited and, printed, as advertized, for better
or for worse. And it was our conviction, for the
better. Despite our mistakes.

As we took a greater bite, the response from
our prison population was most heartening. I think
I can say sincerely that all three former editors are
indebted to the men of Eastern for the tolerance and
understanding they showed. They never demanded
a blast organ or minimized the problems ECHO
faced. They bore patiently with our inexperience;
they proved ready, willing and able not only to
constructively criticize but to support a courageous
stand, article or issue in that unpretentious way
which is both adult and sincere. In short, they came
to accept their very young and very imperfect maga-
zine.

Second to our own population, came the steady
word from various members of the Penal Press.
Suffice it to say that they encouraged us constantly
to keep the faith, and tried in every way to help us
better ourselves without concern that it was some-
one else’s magazine they were trying to improve.
Instead of disregard or jealousy, ECHO met the
most heart-warming reception from prison publi-
cations, most of them so much more advanced than
our own.

With the feel of solid ground under our feet,
and with agreement of the other ECHO ‘‘veterans’’,
I enlarged the editorial staff group at its regular
meetings from the ‘‘perennial big four’’ to a voting
fourteen to eighteen in order to gain even wider in-
mate opinion and more varied inmate consultation.
Inmate advisors were selected, also attending the
staff meetings. (The most regular of these hereto-
fore unmentioned and unsung men were Joseph
Oliver, Joe MecNeair, now Assistant Sports Editor,
N. Budington Harper, Louis Straccioni, R. P. LeRoy,
and Joe Cuff, now Circulation Manager.) All busi-
ness of the magazine was made table business, with
the editor making his moves and decisions only after
conference with his fellow workers. It was made a
policy that the editor never ‘‘surprise’’ his staff by
having them later discover his changes. By trial and
error, this last policy was seen most vital to the
continuation of the hfe of ECHO.

As editor, I subscribed to roughly the same aims
and policies as my predecessors and their staffs, but
of course brought my own editorial policy which my

general staff, as explained, in great part had already

desired, and endorsed, and vigorously supported.

In addition, Jim Morrison and myself revised
eontent formula and worked out a system of ‘‘them-
ine’’ each issue. A new format was groped for and,
in bettering degrees, partially achieved. It can be
seen taking form through the Winter of ‘56 to Win-
ter of ‘57 issues. Morrison labored impressively,
ceiving his creative all to the constantly improving
