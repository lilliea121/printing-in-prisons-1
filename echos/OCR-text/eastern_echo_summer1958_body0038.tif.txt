Home Inown LO alt Olas as 1G JIM Bord:
With the new commissioner at his post we can look
forward to a great season; knowing that ‘‘Big Jim”’
will guide the teams of this league with the maxi-
mum of fairness in every decision.

“it is much too early to speak about the team
potentials or the abilities of the players that make up
the teams of this league, or how they will shape up
in the bid for the ’58 Championship, but I will try to
acquaint you with the teams in the league.

LYNX: Shall we say CONGRATULATIONS to last
year’s Champions and this year’s Defending Cham-
pions, for they will be back trying to do it again.
Dupree replaces Dick Hoffman as the owner and
Rooster returns as captain. Karl Thornton will
again hold down right field. Locke returns along
with a host of new players.

CARDINALS: The 758 Cardinals will not be satis-
fied with just being a contender for the Champion-
ship this year, but will be fighting all the way to
become Champions themselves. This club promises
to be a strong tight-knit organization with ‘‘Snooks”’
back as the owner, Joe Champ managing from the
field and Harry Taylor as the team captain.

ROCKETS: Owner Dave Morrison, with Clee as
manager and Sidney as captain, has put together
a very strong team composed of new faces to bid
for the League Championship. Aside from Clee and
Sidney, only ‘‘Ricco’’ remains from last season to
startle the opposition with his base-running tactics.
All in all, the Rockets will bear watching this season.

PHILLIES: With Norman Harmon as owner, Joe
Brown as manager and George Sanders, captain, the
only word released to this reporter was just, “ Watch
us!’? With a surprise pitcher from last year they
say they intend to make a fight for the Champion-
ship. With that spirit it would seem to me that the
League is in for some very exciting games.

So, until next issue, when your reporter hopes
to be back again, | hope that you get as big a kick
out of these games as | will in reporting them to you.

THE CUBAN LEAGUE
by Joseph ‘‘GI’’ McNeair

The Cuban League club owners; David Croxton,
Moses Taylor, Harry Cohen and Joseph McNeair are
forced to stand idly by and watch lately arrived
softball talent (they had signed) go to the Store-
house League.

However, the owners are still optimistic about
fielding fairly good teams.

Now for a run-down on this years’ teams:
RAMS: Last years’ Champions have changed own-
ership and the new owner, David Croxton, feels that
with fair pitching his club will be a repeater. But,
the sideliners say, ‘‘ With David (Rough and Tough)
Wilder gone the Rams don’t stand a chance.”’

DODGERS: Finishing second last year, they also
are under new management. Harry ‘‘Juice’’ Cohen
will pilot them and he is hopeful of being the best in
1958. To hear John “the Youngster’’ Wheeler and
James ‘‘McCarthy’’ Smith talk, the Dodgers can’t
lose—a lot of weight on their lone pitcher, Runt
Jordan. With the loss of some of their key players,
especially Willie ‘‘Arkansas’’ Wilson and James
‘JW.’ Jackson, the critics feel that despite having
their big stick, Lawrence “Boxcar’’ Keith, the Dod-
gers will linger close to the cellar.

GIANTS: A new team, replacing the Bears in the
Cuban League, the club is owned by Mose ‘‘Chuck’’
Taylor. No one seems to know who the individual
players are at this time. The club’s manager was
asked about his roster and he claimed that he didn’t
keep one. Yours truly assumed that he meant that
he didn’t have one handy, for surely he knows each
club has to supply a roster to each of the other clubs
and to the Commissioner’s office.
Last, but not least, to complete the League:

FALCONS: Under the same management, William
' Horse” Diggs and Joseph Gili MeNeair, this
club finished in the cellar last year. However, at the
close of the season the Birds were playing like Cham-
pions. They checked the Rams winning streak and
knocked the Bears out of first place. ‘‘G.I.’’ and
‘‘Horse’’ were so pleased with the club’s efforts, they
have continued the contracts of some of their play-
ers, namely: John T. White, Leon Wells, James
Selby, William ‘‘Chico’’ Cooper and Sonny Mays.
Though the Falcons lost their ace pitcher, Ed-
ward ‘“Walkie-Talkie’’ Johnson, they acquired
‘“Arkansas’’, catcher and ‘‘Rough and Tough’’
Wilder, who is one of the best pitchers within the
mammoth grays. Promising players on the Falcon’s
roster include: Luther Pinkett, Jr., Elmer Hardy,
Robert Freeman, James Fisher, Leonard Massey,
Theordore J. Dennis, Frank Ray and William
Sampson, “I
