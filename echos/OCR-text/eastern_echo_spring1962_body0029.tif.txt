Playoffs in the

The referees were “Sonny” Mays and W. Carter.
The players for both teams:

COBRAS

Bob Gerlach, “Sea Sock”, Smiley”, Bernard Harris,
Lou McCloud, W. Greene, W. Winters, Willie “No
No” Smith.

TERRORS

Nick Nickens, Crawford “Moose”, Sampson, Rehm,
“Tee Wee”.

The playoffs were played on the big court by the
O.B.B.A., from the one block court. There were some
well played games, with highlights as follows: The
first game both teams were cold, but the big guns for
the Cobras, Gerlach and “Smiley” tallied ten points
each. “Pee Wee” and “Nick” of the Terrors led both
teams scoring 11 points each. At half time the Ter-
rors were leading 23 to 15, but the Cobras came back
in the final half as Gerlach, “Smiley” and Bernard
led the way to victory. Genrlach’s jump shots,
“Smiley’s” driving lay-ups and Bernard’s great re-
bounding caused the Cobra victory. 39 to 34 final.
The second game told a different tale, Gerlach still
leading with his jump shots and Lou McCloud calling
the plays assisted by Bernard, whose fine rebounding
proved to be a winner. “Moose,” Sampson, and Nick
played fine ball although it was a vain attempt, as
the Terrors went down to defeat. The third game
showed a reverse victory as the Terrors were more
effective. “Nick” jump shooting and hitting from the
outside helped “Moose,” whose fine ball handling
and Crawford grabbing all the rebounds, supplied
the win. The last two games were all that was needed
for the Cobras to take the championship. The new
champs, the Cobras played like the champs should,
not to belittle the fine efforts emitted from the losing
Terrors.

Eastern Echo

Boston has won 5 and Lost 4

The Boston club is firmly entrenched in second
place and definitely on the heels of first place, Chal-
lengerslengers. “No-No” has informed this reporter
his team will win the Championship in his division.
With deadly shooting by Crawford, Pee Wee, Mac,
Winters and Bernard, it is strongly possible he could
win all the marbles. One fact is certain, “No-No”. It’s
one thing to talk but again the games must be played
down to the wire. Time will tell if you speak the
words of a wiseman or not.

The Challengers

Bob Gerlach

Moose, Mer.

Ralph Sicoro

Smiley Martin

Bill Sampson George Allen
Bubbles Moose

Ace Gus

This is the strongest club in the league, having
won 7 and lost 1. Seeing this team in action on sev-
eral occasions I have come to the conclusion that this
will be the team to win. Shooting stars such as
Gerlach, “Smiley,” “Moose,” “Ace” and Sampson ap-
pear to be the most deadly in the league. On the
boards is Sicuro who towers over every other player,
in the O.B.B.A. and does his share of scoring to boot.
The best ball handlers are “Moose,” “Ace” and Ger-
lach.

The Sure Pops

“Big Swede”
“Smokey”
“Serarela”

Harry Zietz, Mgr.

“Big Mitchell”

Joe Corvi

Harry Zietz
Whiting

The Sure Pops were making a definite bid to stay

in contention with the top three, posting a 4 win to
5) loss talley. This team has made a remarkable re-
coup after floundering in the basement at the start
of the season. Somehow they have pulled themselves
together and are making known to the other teams,
that they aim to stay in contention all the way. The
teams best playmaker is Whiting, a most accurate
shooter and fine back court man. He has able help
from Zietz, “smokey,” swhor iss san. olds prop ane
“Seratch.” The two biggest players in the league
are “Swede” and Mitchell.
