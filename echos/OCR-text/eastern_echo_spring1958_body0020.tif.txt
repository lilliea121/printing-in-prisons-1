| eae was just leaving the bar, shrugging his coat
up over his shoulders, carrying his heavy sample
ease in his hand, when the two women bumped into
him.

‘‘Sorry,’’ one of the women said.

‘My fault,’’ he apologized, smiling and stepping
aside. The women’s face was heavily made up, theat-
rical, and somehow vaguely familiar. He walked
on a few feet, away from the bar’s entrance, and from
the corner of his eye he saw her face again.

It stared out at him from a show-eard, and above
the smiling face, in letters several inches high, John
read ‘‘ Evelyn Shorter, Appearing in Person Nightly.”’

Evelyn Shorter! That was why he thought he
knew her. She’d been a top star in Hollywood for
over ten years; he’d seen her in a dozen or more
pictures. She’d paid a visit to his camp overseas
during the war, dressed in a thin, revealing gown,
shivering in the almost-zero weather, dancing and
singing for hours to give all the boys a taste of home.

So she’s appearing at the ‘‘Clock’’ every night,
he mused, the excitement mounting. Why don’t I
eo back and say hello to her, he thought. el
probably never get another chance to meet a Holly-
wood star and speak to her personally.

He turned and retraced his steps, going down-
stairs and through the nearly deserted club. No one
upstairs at the bar had noticed him as he’d returned,
and no one downstairs stopped him, so he continued
on into the far end of the club, toward the only
place he could imagine the entertainers would have
their dressing rooms.

In a small corridor he found a door marked with
a star. -He stopped and knocked, and when he heard
someone eall out, ‘‘Come in!’’ he turned the knob
and entered the room, a small, brightly lighted dress-

ing room cluttered with costumes, trunks and chairs.

Miss Shorter sat on a small bench before a
mirror, applying mascara to her eyes. She stopped
with her hand suspended before her face, looking
at John’s reflection in the mirror. ‘‘Yes?’’ she said
inquiringly.

He knew at once he shouldn’t have entered. He
felt uncertain of himself, embarrassed. When the
idea had first occurred to him it had seemed logical,
normal, something anyone would do without a mo-
ment’s thought, but now the liquor’s effeet had worn
off, and he knew he was sober, cold sober, and he was
afraid Miss Shorter would have him tossed out be-
cause he really had no business standing here, tongue-
tied and shamefaced, holding the heavy sample case
awkwardly in his hand.

“*T-T’’ he stuttered. He passed his hand over
his head, smoothing his dishevelled hair, flicking his
tongue across his lips. He spoke again, slowly,
spacing his words evenly, one at a time, not rushing.
‘I’m sorry for burstme in on you, but the truth is

feeling foolish.

Miss Shorter smiled at him graciously. ‘‘This
is my secretary, Miss Dodge,’’ she said, indicating
the tall, thin girl who stood a few feet from the

dressing table, a thin smile playing around her mouth.

Miss Dodge extended her hand.

John hastily dropped the sample case and took
the seeretary’s limp hand in his for a moment, pres-
sine it slightly. “‘My name’s Walton,’’ he said,
‘John Walton.”’

‘‘How are you,’’ Miss Dodge said, and it wasn’t
a question, he knew, merely a greeting.

He stared at the secretary a moment, at her thin,
manuish figure, her eyes and hair without life, dull,
