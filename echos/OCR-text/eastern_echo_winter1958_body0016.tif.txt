“Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, my brother
was snoring and I seen a mouse.”

“Oh, no, no, Daddy, that isn’t right,” cried Daughtie with glee, as she
lifted her little blond head from the pillow of my chest.

I glanced across the living room to my wife, seated beside the fully dec-
orated, glittering Christmas tree. She smiled and her eyes told me, that I
was her man, that she loved me more than anything in all this whole, wide
world.

“Joe, Darling,” she said to me with her big brown eyes. “Tell Daughtie
a true Christmas story.”

A true story? Certainly...

It had to happen this way, there was no other way. For you see, it did
happen the night before Christmas .

My name, well, it’s just a run-of-the-mill name, it’s not world famous, nor
even locally famous. The Social Security Board lists me as Joe Fleissner. I’m
one of the average big town joes.

Nothing out of the ordinary ever happened to me, that is, excepting this
one Christmas Eve. .

Huge snow flakes were falling, light and soft, floating gently down, and
adding a rare beauty and splendor to the colorfully decorated city—a pure,
white splendor that never fails to inject the spirit of Christmas into the hearts
of all men. The rich and poor alike, gazed from their windows and contem-
plated the Christmas snow as it fell from a cold, dark sky to shroud everything
with purity.

Even my cold, bitter heart was warmed momentarily at the sight of na-
ture’s supreme decoration and the multitude of “good cheer” faces that passed
me as I walked the gaily illuminated streets. As I maneuvered along the
crowded side walks, I ruminated over my past life, and tried to remember a
time when I had not been so lonely. For a moment, my childhood flashed be-
fore me, I shuddered and closed my mind to it.

I strolled along thinking and feeling a bit sorry for myself too.

Coming abreast of North Philadelphia Train Station, the activities of the
holiday crowds amused me. I had developed a liking for train stations. It
pleased me just to sit on one of the long, hard benches and serutinize the crowd.

Slowly, a long, black diesel engine pushed its blunted nose by a loading
aisle, stopped. A seemingly scrambled voice began to eall out its presence
and destination. People began to stir, to pick up their small bags and odd
belongings. I watched and smiled. “The rat race goes on and on,” I thought,
“Where are they going and for what? I guess it does not make any difference,
so long as they are happy.”

_ I watched an overloaded train pull out of the station, and felt a bit sorry
for the passengers. I lit a cigarette and gazed about the station. There was
a tiny attraction in the station, that everyone who saw had taken a casual in-
terest in; and no doubt, many wondered why such a treasure was without a
protector. I had noticed the small, dainty form as it sat alone on the bench
across from me, I surmised that the mother of the little angel was somewhere
near. After many minutes, the little girl grew restless and began to run about
the benches. Finally, she stopped directly in front of me and smiled.

“Have you seen my Mommie?” She asked.
