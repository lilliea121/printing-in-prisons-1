The Gospel Train Continued

gressive steps being made toward more brotherhood
in this city and throughout the state.

In the said speech, which was spot-lighted with
refreshing humor and a bit of soul-searching, it was
evident that Mr. Longstreth is a wonderful orator
who is sincere in his endeavor. He made many
lasting friends here who admire him and are in
sympathy with his cause.

At the end of Mr. Longstreth’s speech, Miss
Perry stated, ‘‘It may seem a little strange for a
woman to delve in politics, but, I’m interested too.’’

The inmates, as fellow human beings, are inter-
ested in politics also; that is, in the full sense the
definition of the word implies! The thoughts and
feelings of the inmates at Hastern State Penitentiary
coincide with those of Mr. Longstreth and Miss Perry.

The musical portion of the program was con-
tinued as the ever-popular Norfolk Four came next
with their keen-ness of tonal coloring to further en-
tertain us. Adding a touch of variety to the show,
this very versitile group of young men received a
galaxy of applause, cheers, and laughter with their
witty and humorous tunes: ‘‘The Man Who Drove

The Sky Lighters and their director, Mr. Medly.

The Mule Around The World’’ and “Chicken Pie’’.

As a change of pace in the program, the Sky
Lighters, directed by Mr. Jerome Medly, brought to
the appreciative audience something new and dit-
ferent in the realm of progressive sound, through
their introduction of progressive vocalism in choral
form.

They are to be highly commended because of the
conqured intricacies involved in syncopating their
voices to give an exquisite sound appealing even to
the sensitivities of those who do not ordinarily ap-
preciate progressive jazz. Their interpatations of
‘‘Tntermission Riff’’ and ‘‘Route 66’’ others will find
difficult to equal.

The finale consisted of all the groups singing in
unison, ‘‘God Be With You "Till We Meet Again’’.

The inmates of E.S.P. wish to express their pro-
found gratitiude and thanks to Mrs. Glenna Ban-
nister, Mr. Thatcher Longstreth, Dr. J. A. Tomlin,
and all the other participants in the program for giv-
ing of themselves and their time to help make the
Easter season a very nice and pleasant one for them.
The inmates also wish to especially thank Miss
Portia Perry, and the management and staff of
Radio Station WHAT for the beautiful gift pre-
sented to them. They can certainly make good use
of the lovely Hi Fi record player and record albums
presented. Many many times in this, their interlude
of trial and preparation, they can call on the said gift
and the heart-warming memory of the stated pro-
gram to relive again the thoughtful kindness of
lovely people.

As Superintendent William Banmiller said to
Miss Perry, quoting Portia in Shakespeare’s ‘‘Mer-
chant of Venice’’, ‘“The quality of mercy is not
strain’d, It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
upon the place beneath... .’’

And the inmates feel:

‘Your mercy is above this sceptred sway,
Tt is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God Himself.”’

Also from the Shakespeare’s ‘‘Merchant of Venice’’.

Yes, dear reader, the ‘‘Gospel Train once stop-
ped at this station; and now there is many a stow-
away, In spirit, on board.

Our sincere thanks.
