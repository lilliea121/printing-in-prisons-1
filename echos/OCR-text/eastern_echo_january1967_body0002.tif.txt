U. N. Secretary-General U Thant once told an African
delegation to the United Nations, “Racial prejudice is a serious
form of mental sickness and therefore not a reason for retalia-
tion or violence.”

I believe that all people must recognize that we are all
members of one race: THE HUMAN RACE. Racial problems
which exist throughout the world prevail for reasons more com-
plex than the pigmentation of man’s skin.

There is one sure-fire way to sublimate existing racial
problems. The way is moral. The appeal is to all men—

Do unto others as you would have them do unto you

And as Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. has cited, “We
must all learn to live together as brothers, or we will all perish
together as fools.”
