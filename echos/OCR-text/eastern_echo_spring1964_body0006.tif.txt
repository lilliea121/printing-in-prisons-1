We are all familiar with the term, “Prison In-
mate.’ We know that prison inmates are ex-members
of society who have been convicted of a crime, and
therefore, are lodged in a penal institution to serve
out their sentences. That they often lie fallow, and
upon release become repeaters, can be seen reflected
in the nine percent national crime rise and the ex-
tremely high rate of recidivism, which on a national

scale is seventy-five percent.

Before I explain “PRISON OUTMATES,” which
is a revolutionary concept in penology, I issue a
warning to those who are quite satisfied with present
penal philosophy; the following text will require an
open mind and unless you are willing to be objective,
no purpose will be served by your further reading of

this article.

My writing is directed to the visionaries, the mal-
contents and the dreamers who are never satisfied
with that which is, but are forever inquiring into the
the whys and wherefores, seeing things as they
should be rather than as they are. If you are one of
the indifferent, and yet feel that a more enlightened
treatment of your wayward brethren might—yjust
might—aid in the rehabilitation and return to society
of non-recidivist, useful citizens, then by all means

WORK RELEASE

PRISON OUTMATES is a work release program,
or as it has also been called, a SLEEP—IN-WORK
—OUT system where the convicted offender not
only supports himself but also relieves society of the
burden of supporting his family while he is serving his

sentence.

The State of North Carolina, who only a few years
ago depended on striped pants and leg irons for
“security, is the leader of this new concept in pen-
ology. This is not merely a token or'a pilot program
that the Tar Heel State has instituted. More than
1400 North Carolina prisoners are part of the work
release program. These inmates are priviledged each
morning to hold regular jobs in the free community.

The program is paying off handsomely fer North
Carolina by a diminishing prison population. Yet, the
Federal prison system and most state prison popula-
tions are growing at a phenomenal rate. In the last
two years, since “work release’ has been in effect,
the prison population of North Carolina has de-
creased by more than a 1000 prisoners. This is 300
prisoners less than the predicted increase estimated
by experts a half-dozen years ago. The “‘work re-

THE
QUTMATES

lease’’ was initiated as part of an all-out drive against
crime by Governor Luther Hodges and is being
maintained under the present administration to com-
bat the state’s crime growth. This plan proves that
prisoners can be rehabilitated outside prison walls.
If the main purpose of the penal institution is the
return to society of useful citizens, then we feel that
North Carolina has the answer—in part at least—to
the rehabilitation problem.

PUBLIC REACTION TO WORK RELEASE PRO-
GRAM

Louis Poole, the Assistant Supervisor of inmate
employment in North Carolina, says that employers
recently have begun cooperating to an amazing ex-
tent. ““We just don’t have enough skilled prisoners to
fill all the job requests,’ said Mr. Poole.

“We have prisoners working in the trades, as store
clerks, auto salesmen, laborers, and in many other
occupations. Salaries range up to $140.00 per week.
The average is between $50.00 and $60.00. Take
home pay is left at each prison unit's office. The state
retains $2.25 a day for housing and feeding the pris-
oner. The prisoner is also assessed the cost of trans-
portation to and from work if provided by the state.
He receives a few dollars a week to take care of
personal expenses. The balance of his earnings is
split, with some money earmarked for family support
and the rest for the prisoners trust fund. Many con-
victs are eligible to participate, however, the Prisons
Department excludes sex offenders, dope addicts,
and prisoners housed in maximum security units.

THE STATUS QUO

Is the condition in which we find our penal system

conducive to recidivism ?

There are those among you who shy away from
any disturbance of the “status quo,” and many feel it
