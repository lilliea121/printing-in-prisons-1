WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

Let's Make Up Our Minds

Someday, in the not too distant future, law makers, law enforce-
ment agencies, and judicial bodies are going to have to make up their
minds whether they want to rehabilitate convicts or merely isolate them
from society for long periods. The word, rehabilitation, is the most over-
worked and meaningless word in the penal system, but since it is the
tag generally applied to this new-century theory we’ll use it also. If
a man is to be rehabilitated, why must the process be such a lengthy
one? It’s rather silly to tell a man who has ten or fifty years to serve
that he isn’t being punished, he is being rehabilitated. And that the
lengthy sentence is for his own good.

The old “lock ‘em up and throw away the key” concept of penology
appears to be gaining ground. In most states, lengthy sentences are
still the rule, rather than the exception. Perhaps this long sentence
thing had some merit back when Dillinger was running around the
country robbing banks, and ‘terrorizing the country.’ But Pve been
unable to uncover one scrap of evidence that would indicate that
Dillinger ever invaded the East. Isn’t it defeating the purpose of justice
to continue to lock men up for such long periods of time simply because
the F.B.I.. statistics show . . . etc. Depending on who interprets the
statistics, statistics can lie and do lie. People are not digits that can be
traced on graphs, although this is getting to be a popular belief among
the many ‘ologists, that over populate the prisons today.

We’re not quite sure what it is the state and courts expect of us
while we serve such long sentences. We know, of course that they
would like to see every one of us rehabilitated. But their manner in
going about helping us to acquire this status sometimes leaves us be-
wildered. Can a twenty-year old youngster become rehabilitated with
the knowledge always before him that when he goes home he will be a
middle-aged ancient?

There may be something to the modern methods of rehabilitating
prisoners, but we fail to understand what it is. Punishment for punish-
ment’s sake? Rehabilitation? Which ever it’s going to be, let’s have it
and stop hiding behind these false masks. Joseph J. Cuff, Editor

WE CAN DO BETTER

The generous donations of blood to
the Bloodmobile, during its visit of
December 23; 1958, were greatly appreci-
ated, as evidenced in a letter received by
Dr. Nathan Blumberg from the American
Red Cross representative. It read in part:

‘‘Dear Doctor Blumberg:
‘‘Thank you, your staff, and all the
wonderful DONORS, who helped make
the Bloodmobile visit of December
23 1958, such a fine one—of 143 pints
of Blood!
“‘VYou will never know, how very
important this was, at this Holiday
Season—so we are doubly grateful
and want the DONORS to know of
our appreciation of this help to those
needing blood in the hospitals!
‘“‘We wish you a Very Happy New
Year and thanks again to all of you
at Hastern State Penitentiary.’’
Gratefully and Sincerely,

(S) Mary T. Foster, Volunteer Blood
Chairman, Central Branch, ARC

The total amount of blood donated
was an increase over that of the previous
visit. Congratulations to all who partic-
ipated in this effort and who share the
expressed appreciation of those who will
benefit by such generosity.

The Bloodmobile will return for ad-
ditional visits and your contribution is
needed. et’s all get into the act and
make the next total an even greater
one. —J.M.

Recently one of the inmates at the
State Penitentiary at Graterford suggested
that I send for a copy of the EASTERN
HCHO, I did so.

You have a splendid publication. I have
taken a great interest in penal work, and
you will observe that I have suggested
that you send a copy to Others, Inc., which
is a non-profit foundation.

““The Story of Others, Inc.’’ is enclosed,
and will give you some idea of the type of
