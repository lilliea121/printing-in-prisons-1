Linotype & Intertype Machines — These are automatie
linecasting machines that set type mechanically. The
operator sits at a keyboard similar to a typewriter. Each
type face and size has its own magazine, and the ma-
chines shown above hold three magazines at one time.
The process of setting type by machine and then remelt-
ing the dead metal for re-use is known as a non-distribu-
tion system. Our printing plant is 90 to 95% non-distri-
bution. Operators (from left to right) are John Royal,
Calvin Crist and Harold Foster.

Monotype Machine & Composition Frames — The
Monotype consists of two machines, a keyboard (not
shown) and a caster. The Monotype casts and assembles
individual types, strip spacing material, rules, borders,
case types and other composing-room needs. In the back-
ground are the Composing Frames where the Compositor
spends a major portion of his time in assembling, cor-
recting, and making up of forms consisting entirely or
largely of machine-cast matter. Some display lines and
some small or special display work is set by hand. Opera-
tor is Morales Adolph.
