It was pauperism rather than crime that brought
about the next upheaval in European prison labor.
As the power of the guilds declined, their members
found themselves out of work and foreed to beg in
the streets. The economic effect of so many guilds-
men being unemployed was felt in the other forms of
labor and soon the streets were flooded with beggars
in greater numbers than the workhouse’s could hold.
In 1771, the deputies of Flanders called up Hyppo-
lyte Vilain to deal with the problem. His work in the
field of prisons and prison labor has earned him the
title of the father of modern penitentiary science.
Vilains main objective was the reformation of the fel-
ons (actually beggars) and his method was hard
work. As a slogan he adopted the bible quotation
“Tf any man will not work neither let him eat.” In
some ways Vilain was two hundred years ahead of
his time, for the ideas that he gave birth to, form the
basis for today’s vocational programs. He was cog-
nizant of the fact that trade instruction was the first
step in rehabilitation procedure and instituted shops
where this instruction was given practical applica-
tion. The success of these shops was established by
the hue and ery that free labor raised against them.
Under Vilains guidance the inmate not only reecived
vocational guidance but was given medical care and
had a chaplain for his spiritual needs. Another Vilain
original was the idea of common workshops but soli-
tary cells. His blueprint for the prison at Ghent in-
fluenced the structure of the majority of our Ameri-

‘an penitentiaries.
Before we conelude our look at the early forms of

prison labor their is one type that we should give
close observation to, the make-work device. While
the method of the treadmill or the crank may have
been discontinued, other forms of make-work have
cropped up in our own penitentiaries. These include
the assignment of men to sweep certain sectors of the
prison yard, shining brass and any other type of labor
that is not only uscless but may destroy a man’s ini-
tiative. The treadmill was originally intended for
the useful purpose of grinding corn, pumping: water,
and general prison work.

Tor an exact description we quote the Encycelo-
pedia Britannica: Introduced by Sir William Cubitt
in 1818 and intended by him as a means of employing
criminals usefully, “It was a large cylinder of wood
on an iron frame, around the circumference of which
were a series of steps about 74 inches apart. The
criminal, steadying himself by hand-rails on either
side, trod on these, his weight causing the mill to
revolve, and compelling, him to take each step in
turn. In the brutalizing system formerly in vouge
the necessary resistance was obtained by weights,
thus condemming the offender to useless toil and de-
feating the inventors object. The speed of the wheel
was regulated by a brake. Usually it revolved at the
rate of 32 feet per minute. The prisoner worked for
six hours each day, three hours at a time. He was on
the wheel for fifteen minutes and then rested for five
minutes. Thus in the course of his day’s labor he
climbed 8,640 feet. Isolation of prisoners at their
work was obtained by screens of wood on each side
of the mill, converting the working space into a sep-
arate compartment.

3y the Prison Act of 1865, every male prisoner over
sixteen, sentenced to hard labor, had to spend three
months at least of his sentence-in labor of the first
class. This consisted primarily of the treadmill, or,
as the alternative, the crank. The latter consisted of
a small wheel, like the paddlewheel of a steamer and
a handle turned by the prisoner made it revolve in
a hox partly filled with gravel. The amount of gravel
regulated the hard labor; or the necessary resistance
was obtained by a brake, by which a pressure, usually
a twelve pound was applied. The prisoner had to
make 8,000 or 10,000 revolutions during his six hours
work, according to his strength, the number being
registered on a dial.

While the crank and treadmill have been diseon-
tinued, we might just as well have kept them around
if we are to use other forms of make-work.

In the following articles we are given a look at
other types of prison labor that have been tried dur-
ing the twentieth century.

In studying the backgrounds of three hundred inmates of Sing Sing, Dr.
Mary Van Kleeck discovered that unemployment was present, more often
than not, in crimes against property. This category (property crimes) con-
stituted the majority of offenses for which the average inmate of this group
was sentenced. Dr. Van Kleeck, in review, had this comment to make:

“Many individuals who are unemployed and who have similar difficult

conditions to face, have broken laws.

On the other hand, it seems evident

ihat as industrial depression throws men out of work there are always a num-
ber of men on the borderline who cannot resist this last pressure of economic
insecurity. Whatever place we assign to such a condition as unemployment in
its influence upon crime, we can at least be certain that a man’s relation to his
work must have attention by those who would prevent crime or by those who
would restore him to a normal status in the community.”
