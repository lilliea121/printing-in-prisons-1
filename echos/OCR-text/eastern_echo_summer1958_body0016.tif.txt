Human Rights

by JOSEPH J. CUFF

14

Or a few short years ago, the Nazi regime filled
prisons and concentration camps with men who
had never been judged, men who were to die shame-
fully without ever knowing the reason why. Even
today, all of the fundamental guarantees of individu-
al liberty proclaimed in the Declaration of Human
Rights are not fulfilled everywhere.

It will be wise to meditate for a few moments
on the long, hard road which men have had to travel
before their ‘‘right to liberty and security of person’’
was formally recognized. This is the most basic of
rights after the right to life itself.

Until he is condemned, a defendant is presumed
innocent. It is up to the state and its representative
to prove the accusations against him.

More than at any other time, it is during the
phase of investigation that the state must remember —
that the accused is presumed innocent and that, even
if he is found guilty, he remains a man and must be
treated as one. The Declaration of Human Rights
states very simply: ‘‘No one shall be subjected to
torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment.

CURSE OF ALL ERAS

There is a good deal in this short sentence. In
its soberness, it opens some frightening glimpses of
the range of human agony. Torture was not the
exclusive property of the Middle Ages. It has been
the curse of all eras and of all countries. For there
has always been—and there always will be—the
irritating case of the defendant accused from all
sides but without any actual proof against him.

At this point you can find the obsession of nearly
every police foree—the extortion of a confession.
Though the rack and the thumb screw may not be
used today, there are still endless sessions of grilling
without food or sleep, to say nothing of the more or
less refined form of the ‘‘third degree’’.
