Penology

In the early part of this century, prison man-
agement was typified by the strong, individual war-
den—the “boss” who ran a one-man show. He ran
the prison, directed it himself, and was personally
familiar with every operation that was associated
with it. He was looked upon with favor when he told
his guards, “Dll never ask a guard to do anything
Incant- do mryselt

A Warden who starts out today with that
philosophy had better get out of the management
field, because he is doomed. He never will be able
to accomplish much. If he waits until he is an ex-
pert in every aspect of the business, he will be in
retirement before he is ready to begin.

The practice of prison management has changed
considerably in the past 50 years. Treatment, econ-
omic and social conditions are completely different.
Prison populations have grown tremendously;
treatment for rehabilitation has new importance;
punishment for punishment’s sake is slowly vanish-
ing. Accordingly, prison management is more com-
plicated. The growth of the democratic way of life
has brought upon prisons new requirements in treat-
ment. When a state entrusts to a warden and his
staff a portion of its human beings, it is their moral
obligation to realize a good return on the investment
the state had made in them.

These new conditions are forcing the growth of
a @ letely hilosophy in Modern Penolog
a completely new philosophy in Modern Penology.
They are developing new types of treatment and new
sets of rules. They are bringing all our ideas of
Modern Penology to new levels of prison operation.
The theory of this new philosophy is familiar. The
practice is something they are learning.

Let me establish first that the keystone of this
philosophy is the conviction that the strongest mo-
tivating force in the human being, barring self-
preservation, is PRIDE OF ACHIEVEMENT. I
mean that pride which satisfies each individual with-
in his own heart that he is contributing something
worth while. All aspects of this philosophy are
