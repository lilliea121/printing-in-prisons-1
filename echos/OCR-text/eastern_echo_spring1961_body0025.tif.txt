IN hat Price
Complacency

by Spencer Walden

In a recently published article it was pointed out
that the loot netted bank robbers during the past
year amounted to $1,300,000 while that obtained by
embezzlers exeeeded this amount by a sum ten times
BPC,

It is to be regretted the article did not include the
ageregate length of the terms of imprisonment im-
posed by the courts as a penalty for these crimes for,
had this been done, it would have revealed the total
imposed on the bank robbers to be ten times greater
than that imposed on the embezzlers.

A brief study of this situation reveals the vast ma-
jority of the embezzlers receives but a token slap of
the wrist for his betrayal of trust while it is a well
established fact the bank robber is sentenced to any-
thing up to and including death though not charged
with a capital crime.

Although both conceived and carried out an unlaw-
ful means to an end the comparison differs not so
much in the degree of operation as it does in the end
result when both are held to account for it is then the
penalty compliments one while condemning the other.
Apparently, in the eyes of the law, the pen is not
mightier than the sword when in the hands of the
embezzler.

The explanations given by the courts in justifying
disparity of sentence all too often borders on expe-
dient temporizing, much in the manner of the boot-
legger who upon becoming addicted to his product

commenced selling it at a price considerably less than
he paid for it. When asked how he expected to man-
age a profit by such a method airily explained, ‘‘By
sales volume.”’

We do not intend to disparage the embezzler, how-
ever, it is a well known fact that presentence investi-
gation by the courts invaribly reveals the embezzler
lived on a lavish seale and in the process accumulated
gambling debts. The bank robber, with few excep-
tions, comes from the so-called other side of the
tracks where a hand to mouth existence is the rule
rather than the exception and he accumulates little
other than an infamous reputation.

In neither case is the cause an excuse in the eyes
of the law unless influential friends appear bringing
pressure to bear when most needed. It is at such
time when mitigating circumstances crop up. The
question of who will have influential friends when
facing what is commonly referred to as the bar of
justice is academic while that of disparity of sentence
or inequity is considered moot.

Where neither man nor woman was ever designed
by nature to resist temptation the resistance of those
whose existence has been one of over-exposure to
economic malnutrition has been lessened by it. De-
spite this there will always be those who will
vehemently protest that, like ignorance of the law,
dire circumstances are no excuse for violating it and
they are right—it is a reason. Only the moral hypo-
erite would attempt to equate man’s resistance to
temptation, for obviously so, no intelligent person
would contend they could resist temptation in all its
varied forms. Because of this it 1s to be wondered at
that more of those who breach the laws of man and
nature are not emeshed in such toils.

The segments composing society are many and
raried and if among them there be one without its
quota of errant members that segment would consti-
tute the highest attainment of mankind. Whatever the
profession be it politics, law, medical, the many
sciences, business, finance, the clergy or sports among
which none of its members ever breached the laws of
man, nature or the ethical codes of society history has
failed to record this fact.

It has been estimated the total yearly loot taken
from department stores, supermarkets and hotels to-
gether with that taken from other businesses through
such means as fraudulent contracting, corruption,
eratt, political devices, chicanery, devious bookkeep-
ing, ete., would if applied to the national debt result
in an appreciable reduction. More to the point, a
veritable army of people are required to move loot
of sueh proportion. This army grows on a yearly
basis and very obviously is not confined in prison. In
comparison the fabled bank robber is but a small time
operator.

In view of this it would appear that no one segment
of society is morally qualified to hurl the first stone at
another and tends to dispute the fallacious contention
society is united in condemnation of its convicted
derelicts.
