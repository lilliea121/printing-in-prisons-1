prudance was a man. He was Derrick Jonson, a ferry
operator on the Neshaminy Creek in Bucks County.

His victim, like that of Judith Roe, is unknown,
but we do know that the murder probably resulted
from a brawl in Jonson’s ferry shanty. Derrick
threw his victim’s body into the creek, but it was
recovered by the authorities. Thus, Jonson, who was
supposedly a man of parts in the community, came
to a sorrowful end (July 1693), swinging from the
gallows tree.

The spot of Jonson’s hanging became known as
Tyburn—dubbed that after its notorious counterpart
in London—where thousands of criminals swung for
over a cenitiay, Today, tne meme Wyouucn ineiy loo Seem
on maps of Bucks County. It lies between Morrisville
and Bristol at a place once known as Crewhorn, or
Creekhorn, in Falls Township. Records later showed
that the jail where Jonson was detained was so dilapi-
dated and insecure that it was deemed wise to hasten
the execution, lest he abscond.

In fact, Sheriff Israel Taylor, who was a Quaker
rather hoped he would run away, since he loathed his
unpleasant task of executing Jonson. According to the
records, the sheriff resigned after the murderer was
dispatched.

There were few, the report further states, who
came to witness the ghastly spectacle of a man danc-
ing on the air.

This was not typical, as we have discovered
from studies of executions elsewhere. Hangings
have always been considered a major public attrac-
tion, with thousands taking the day of the hanging
as a holiday from work, and often traveling 30 to 50
miles to witness the event.

After Jonson’s demise, his widow, Bridga, or
Breta, petitioned the colonial council for financial help,
but we have no record of the outcome of the appeal.
Perhaps in 1693, public officials were not yet concerned
regarding the welfare of the survivors of the executed.
By 1725 this oversight was corrected, at least in so far
as owners of slaves were concerned. When a slave
WasmexcClHned, a5 valtation was made, and ovwalerc
were paid from funds taken from the local treasury.
Records tell of Phoebe, a slave in Chester County. She
was the property of one Richardson, and was executed
im 1704 tom bitrelary. ler value was placed at 55
pounds, and Mr. Richardson was promptly paid. But
in 1693, Mrs. Derrick Jonson apparently was not com-
pensated for the loss of her bread-winner.

Judith Roe and Derrick Jonson are the only
persons recorded as being executed in the 17th cen-
tury. Hugh Pugh and Lazarus Thomas murdered
Jonathan Hayes of Marple (then a part of Chester
County—now a part of Delaware County) in 1715.
These two, one a millwright, and the other a common
laborer, were referred to as members “of a gang of
Loose Fellows.” For some obscure and strange rea-
son they ran free for almost three years before finally

being apprehended. They were sentenced to death,
denied an appeal, and executed on May 19, 1718.

Slightly less than half of all Pennsylvania execu-
tions took place between 1682 and 1834. At the end
of the period, however, Pennsylvania took the lead
and abolished public hangings. Records of this period
show about 235 public executions between 1682 and
1834.

About 100 of these hangings took place in Phila-
delphia, mostly on the Commons or Public Square, in
the vicinity of where City Hall now stands.

Philadelphia’s first hanging was November 19,
1720, when Edward Hunt was put to death. He was
charged with treason, but his actual crime was coun-
terfeiting. Martha, his wife, was also involved, and
while she escaped the death penalty, she did not
escape a heavy fine. Hunt, a transported servant
come from England, spoke fervently at the gallows,
contending that he had not maliciously or delib-
erately done wrong, and despite his bitterness, for-
gave those who testified against him.

He begged that his “poor wife be preserved
against the pollutions of the world,” but in 1724 Mar-
tha again came face to face with the law. There is no
record of the offenses, but it couldn’t have been serious.
The court pardoned her from a sentence of life im-
prisonment.

articles of sociology and anthropology, tracing the
history of public executions in Pennsylvania.

“On Friday the roth inst. Peter Murphy and
Catherine Bevan were executed at New Castle, the Man
hanged and the Woman burnt, pursuant to their Sen-
ences, Wor ime MWikurcer on Idlarmy Bevan, iclusoamd ot

This was the blunt and succinct news read by
patrons of the Pennsylvania Gazette, a Philadelphia
newspaper which covered the execution in its Sep-
tember 9-23 edition.

The execution itself, although newsworthy, was
not uncommon. The fact that a woman was burnt to
death for her crime, however, was.

Catherine Bevan, about 50 years old, plotted with
the family servant, Peter Murphy, somewhat younger
than she, to dispose of her husband, Harry, who was
about 60.

The newspaper reported in its June 24 issue that
the woman, “generally suspected to be intimate with
the servant” sent Murphy into town for some “Rat
Bone. . . or Roman Vitriol” which she gave her hus-
band “dissolved in a Glass of Wine.” Fearing the
poison would not “have the Desir’d Effect she implored
the Servant to beat his Master well, especially about
