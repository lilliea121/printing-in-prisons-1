(PRA Dispatch) Bastern Penitentiary, Phila, Pa——The history of prison
scribes can be traced back to the first decade of the 17th century, when on a false
charge of treason, Sir Walter Raleigh faced the hammer of doom and was jugged
by King James in the infamous Tower of London. History has it, while so con-
fined, he wrote the first of his projected eight-volume history of the world. Later,
in 1607, he was beheaded.

The pages of history are illuminated with numerous erstwhile contemporaries
—victims of political and religious oppression—whose immortal works were des-
tined to mold and shape the lives of millions then unborn. Here, in America, how-
ever, there is some reasonable semblance of due process of law—a government of
laws and not of men—which protects its citizens from being imprisoned or execu-
ted at the mere whim and caprice of a sovereign ruler; and further, precludes the
hapless one of today from becoming the favorite—or even jailer—of tomorrow.

Indeed, notwithstanding personal prejudices, no criminal—no matter how
profligate—but, by the common law, is allowed his locus penitentiae. For the com-
mon law, in its wisdom and humanity, says: “You shall have a chance to reform;
in all events, what you are liable to be tried for is an overt act of guilt and not a
violent temper or a depraved heart.”

Sometime, during the last quarter of the 19th century, this basic American
principle won some recognition among the more progressive-minded penologists
of that era. Accordingly, some prison inmates were given enough latitude to shake
the doldrums of prison stupor and the drudgery of rock pile-jute mill routine, by
indulging in a bit of self-therapeutic creativity such as wood carving, leather and
metal craft and, of course, writing.

The first known trickle of writing to 00ze from behind American prison walls
came from the fabled pen of O. Henry. Entombed in the Ohio State Penitentiary
—one of the many ancient bastiles currently in use—O. Henry enblazened his name

‘in the annals of American literature by writing stories. His success as a sold writer

behind bars gave him both the money and incentive to go to New York upon his
release to pursue the literary career which is now history.

According to Dr. Walter A. Lunden, professor of sociology at Iowa State
College—a prolific researcher and invaluable contributor to the captive press—the
first American prison publication made its appearance on Thanksgiving Day in
1883, at the Elmira Reformatory in New York. “This weekly newspaper,” writes
Dr. Lunden in one of the prison journals (The Spectator, Jackson, Mich.) “car-
ried a decorative masthead with the name, THE SUMMARY.

‘

“The Summary,” the article continues, “contained news of events within the
prison, announcements, poetry and reports of addresses delivered at inmate con-
vocations.” Dr. Lunden further reports that the second inmate publication made
its debut in the Wisconsin State Prison at Waupun in 1886, dubbed THE PRISON
PRESS. It sold both to inmates and the public at five cents per copy. According
to the researcher, this four-page newspaper contained short stories, shop news,
official notices, a lost and found section, want ads, and advertisements from Wau-
pun merchants.

On the editorial page, he observes, Editor Wooten contended that The Prison
Press was the first of its kind. He acknowledged the existence of the Summary
but insisted that “it is circulated gratuituously ... and is edited and published by
the Superintendent and (official) assistants of the Reformatory, and is not there-
fore, in any sense, a prisoner’s paper.”

“Thus began,” Dr. Lunden declares, “the distinction between THE FRONT

oners generally have a profound respect for the latter, but reserve a seething con-
tempt for the former for obyious reasons.

The third publication, according to Dr. Lunden, developed in the adjoining
state of Minnesota at the State Prison in Stillwater, when in 1887, the inmates of
that institution produced The Prison Mirror, which is still in circulation today. In
1894, the Ohio Penitentiary News followed, and is also currently in circulation.

Our second source of information comes in the person of Herman k. Spector,
no less an authority, who in 1947, passed a stiff civil service examination to be-
come the first official librarian of San Quentin Prison in California. A prolific
researcher of literature, historian and wrter, this affable gentleman dishes out a
generous portion of diversified material, including copies or the san, Ouentin
