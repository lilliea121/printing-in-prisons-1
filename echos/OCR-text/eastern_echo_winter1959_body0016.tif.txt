(PPA Dispatch) Eastern Penitent-
iary, Phila., Pa—As we go on “ghosting”
The Saga of the Penal Press, it is rather
significant to note that while it made its
auspicious debut at the turn of the cen-
tury more or less as an enlightened pen
ological stratagem, designed to relieve
the monotony in the unvaried curriculum
of prison routine, its primary function
today is of a somewhat different nature.

In addition to its therapeutic as-
peets, with the advent of modern penolo-
gy in the last decade, it has been estab-
lished and generally understood that the
primary purpose of prison journalism is
to build a bridge of understanding be-
tween the mainland of free society and
the inmate’s island. No less a widely
recognized theorist as Dr. Walter A.
Lunden of Iowa State College, gives this
popular and intelligent view: “The objec-
tive has been to establish a better under-
standing between the prison and the pub-
lic by means of printed words. Here,
then, is the ultimate and overall reason
for prison publications, to help the public
appreciate life inside the prison and
surmount the high wall of misunderstand-
MMOs”

Therefore, all else must now be con-
sidered as secondary and only incidental
thereto. It is with that thought in mind
that’ we unfoid, this, the second install-
ment of the story of the captive press.

The physical construction of any
bridge requires an assortment of skills—
architectural and mechanical—to trans-
form the detailed drawings of the drafts-
men into useful reality. Building the
“bridge of understanding’’ is much the
Same; and as is true of any project
undertaking, there are always certain
hazards and safeguards to be regarded.

Within

pretty wide limits, the

‘“bridge’’ rises or falls on the ability of
one man—the construction superintend-
ent; or more succinetly, the editor-in-
chief. Notwithstanding the lack of mat-
erial and resources, lesser publications—
whether in prison or on the open market
—are edited by lesser editors whose only
interest is in pampering a_ personal
pride. When this happens the safety of
the “bridge’’ is threatened—scaffolds
weaken, guy-lines slacken, and invariably
some unsuspecting fellow-workers are lost
in the turbulent sea of official discipline.
The concomitant result is all too obvious
—the “bridge” comes down to the editor’s
level; and retards progress all along the
line, from Maine to California.

As Aron M. Mathieu, business man-
ager of the Writers Digest, and widely
recognized publishing authority, says:
“A good editor is part messiah and, since
he needs to have a lot of people dancing
his tune, he is a part honky-tonk guy, be-
cause crowds douw’t follow straight Bach.”
He was not speaking of prison journal-
ism, of course, but doesn’t that fact eq-
ually, if not more so, apply to the captive
press?

Figuratively speaking, a prison ed-
itor must have a more sensitive regard
for his fellow-men than they do for him.
It is a kind of human relations sort of
thing impelled by a mature mind. If
they feel, the editor feels more. If they
TOW, Ine Girls soe weemn, Ils waeue eyes
moisten, he is bathed in tears. He has
no time for poetry with sick rhythms and
rancid rhymes. He’s too busy communi-
cating ideas—taking up the slack in the
line, replacing an inferior half-hitch with
a substantial bowline; striving to make
every published word a fraction better
than it otherwise would be.

Above all the editor must have The
Word. What is The Word? In the pub-
lishing business outside, it varies because

the competitors are not working on the
same ‘‘bridge.’’ In prison journalism,
however, it never varies; The Word is al-
ways the same and it is always there—
clear and bright and loud to every ear,
like a trumpet scaring over a band:
“To speak FOR rather than TO the pris-
oner, and include the outside reader in
the conversation.”

An editor without The Word is in a
heap of trouble. For as Mathieu says,
(Gif we may paraphrase) “He is like a
manufacturer about to go into receiver-
ship or bankruptcy, or like a pedestrian
turned loose on the Indianapolis Speed-
way on Memorial Day.” Hither way,
you’ve had it!

“Lucky is the editor,’’ says Mathieu,
“who has a ‘pusher’ (a Jim Morrison) an
assistant of wit and energy who tries to
lead rather than follow him.” (And skill-
ed in the science of graphic arts). Gocd
editorial staffs are rife with intellectual
feuds (never personal grudgings) that
tear apart the forthcoming edition so
the editor may better make a decision.
For editorial decisions are never made by
a ‘vigged’’ jury. He has the last word
and suffers all consequences of every
published word. Once he dodges this fact,
it is time . . . well, what is a better word
for editor-hunting?

Who selects editors? With few ex-
ceptions, the keeper of the keys on recom-
mendations made by the educational de-
partment and the administrative staff.
To allow inmates to select editors is com-
parable to permitting the state’s witness
to sit in a jury box in a criminal trial.
The more successful editors are invar-
iably screened by the educational depart-
ment, who know his competency and char-
acter by dealing directly with it on a
daily basis. This does not mean, however,
that inmates are not competent to do
their own intellectual thinking. To the
contrary, most of them are—when they
want to. But who is to determine when?
Of course, these are other serious inroads
to be considered, and therefore adminis-
trative matters are best left in the hands
of those more suited to the calling. Then,
and only then, one knows where the ulti-
mate responsibility lies. For what is an
editor without a publisher? Further,
would it be too presumptious to assume—
as we Shall soon see—that the prison
journal is a typical reflection of adminis-
trative policy?

According to Herman K. Spector,
official librarian of San Quentin Prison
for more than a decade, The Penal Press
is roughly divided into three groups.
“Hirst, ’ he says, “we have those under
complete and rigid control of the admin-
istration ... printing Little more than
official news of the institution and dull
platitudes in the form of editorials.

“On a higher scale,’ he observes,
“are the magazines which add to the diet,
morsels of fiction, humor and comment,
but under strict censorship rule to pre-
vent the appearance of what the Jap-
anese call “wrong thoughts. ’?

“At the top,” he says rather glow-
