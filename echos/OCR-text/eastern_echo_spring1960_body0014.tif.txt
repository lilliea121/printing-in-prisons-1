Judge Stout holds Doctor of Jurisprudence and
Master of Laws Degrees from Indiana Univer-
sity. She was Chief of the Appeals, Pardons,
and Paroles Division of the District Attorney’s
Office, Philadelphia County, from 1957 to 1959;
was appointed to the Municipal Court Bench in
October, 1959, and elected to a ten year term
in November, 1959.

“Parolee gives award-winning suggestion to in-
dustry.” “Ex-convict conducts successful business,
provides employment for ten.” “Former prisoner, re-
leased recently by Board of Pardons, rescues lad
from burning house.” “Hastern State ‘graduate’ re-
celves degree from local college.” Such headlines,
and similar ones, descriptive of the activities of more
than a few rehabilitated citizens almost never ap-
pear. On the other hand, the publicity given those
_few parolees who do return to crime is likely to con-
vey the erroneous impression that recidivism is the
rule rather than the exception.

Recidivism is the exception because of the great
care used by the several officials whose recommenda-
tions determine the release or non-release of the ap-
plicant for commutation of minimum sentence. One
who makes such recommendation is the District At-
torney of the county in which conviction occurred.
His recommendation is formulated after a careful
study of the trial record, an interview with the appli-
cant, a study of his prison record, a conference with
the Warden and Staff Members of the institution of
ineareceration, a verification of the proposed home,
sponsor and job, and in many eases, consultation
with the victim or family of the victim when the
erime is one of violence and the victim or family can
be located. Such thorough consideration enables the
District Attorney to select for recommendation, from
a large number of applicants, those few who appear
to be rehabilitated and who will create no undue risk
to society.

A study of the trial record discloses the facts of
the crime. A robbery, for example, may be carefully
planned by a group of men and brutally executed by
them while armed with loaded revolvers as another
accomplice waits in a get-away car. Another rob-
bery may be committed by other persons, without
violence or brutality, and while armed with a pistol,
real and menacing looking, but actually a harmless
toy. All defendants properly may have received an
indeterminate sentence of 10 to 20 years. On the facts

of the respective crimes alone, the robbers who
neither did harm to the victims nor carried a death
dealing weapon would be entitled to more favorable
consideration on application for commutation of
minimum sentence than the brutal robbers who went
to rob, but were prepared to kill, and who inflicted
physical injury on the victim.

An interview with the applicant is most helpful
in determining whether he has gained insight into
the problem which caused him to engage in anti-
social conduct, whether he has made diligent and
successful effort to solve the problem, and whether he
feels any remorse for the crime committed. The in-
terview is helpful also in determining the outlook,
plans, and sincerity of purpose the applicant has for
the future.

The prison record is one of the most complete
and reliable indices of the degree of rehabilitation
the applicant has achieved. Not only does it present
a conduct report showing the nature of disciplinary
infractions, if any, of the applicant while incarcer-
ated but it shows, among other things, his religious
participation, educational achievements, sports ac-
tivities, work record, amount of money saved, a-
mount of money sent to family, medical, psycho-
logical and psychiatric history of the inmate, and the
length of time served. This record is most helpful as
an indication of the respect the applicant has gained
for authority, the skills or trades he has acquired
from which he might expect employment upon re-
lease such as barbering, printing, masonry, butcher-
ing, typing, shorthand, etc., his industry and thrift.
The psychological report is invaluable in determining
personality stability or lack thereof, and whether or
not there is any indication of a likelihood of re-
eidivism.

The Warden and Staff Members of the institution
are the persons who actually know the inmate best,
for it is they who have lived with him daily during
his inearceration. Their evaluation of the inmate is
given great weight by the District Attorney in the
determination of his recommendation.
