find activity any time of the day. The men in the
Dispensary also double as nurses in the Operating
Room. They include Charles Taylor, Earl Brogan,
Harold Foster and William Sutton. The duties of
the dispensary include among other things; the giv-
ing of penicillin shots, swabs, and Topical medical
applications. For their duties in the operating room,
they must be specially trained. They assist as In-
strument Nurse, Scrub Nurse, Operating Nurse, and
Dispensary Nurse. While this reporter was inter-
viewing Dr. Armando F. Goracci, we were told
that operations here are done according to standard
operating procedure accepted everywhere today.
Dr. Goracei, who took his Pre-Medical Training at
the University of Scranton and his Medical Training
at. St. Louis University, took his Graduate Training
in Surgery at the Jefferson Medical Center where he
now is‘an Instructor of Surgery. Dr. Goracci, who
also operates at many other hospitals such as Jeffer-
son, Philadelphia General, Doctors, and Memorial
of Woodbury, New Jersey, emphasized that the men
who are operated on here receive the same attention
as any paying patient outside. Operations take
place during week-ends, usually Saturdays, and
about 300 are performed per year. The doctor told
us that there are facilities here to cope with virtually
every type of General Surgery. In an emergency,
the doctor can be called in at any time. The Laun-
dry has special washers to prepare linen for the
Medical Department.

As T progressed further down the Block, I
stopped in to talk with Dr. Nathan Blumberg, Medi-
eal Director. All of Dr. Blumberg’s “credits’’ would

take up more space than we have here. He was for
years the Chief of Diseases of the Chest at Philadel-
phia General Hospital and Chief of Medical Ser-
vices at the Jewish Hospital. Even now he holds
many Honorary and Advisory positions. He has
been Medical Director here for more than five years.
His duties include a supervisory capacity of all the
men in the Medical Department, liason between the
administrative force and all medical departments,
and the preparation of health reports on all men to
the Commutation and Parole Boards and also, the
Governor. He told me that he was especially im-
pressed with the complete loyalty of the men with
whom he works here.

Further down the bloek we found the Labora-
tory. Here all the tests needed for information and
analysis of individual cases are made. All men
that come through the EDCC are given various tests
to determine the possible presence of diseases or
ailments. The Lab is equipped for almost any type
of test necessary. Diabetes and other ailments that
might need immediate care are given priority and
immediate attention.

The rest of the block consists of the Diet Kit-
chen, Cells for those confined to the Block, and as
you reverse your direction you come to the X-Ray
Room, the Psychiatrist’s Office, and the last main
segment of the Block before leaving is the Hospital
proper.

The Diet Kitchen is
responsible for the feed-
ing of those that require
a special diet and also the
feeding of special meals
to those with Diabetes and
Uleers. There are approxi-
mately one hundred per-
sons fed each meal. John-
ny Frank is the cook and
he has six helpers. Alfred
Johnson, Howard Strange,
Claude Bowser, Edward
Gist, Edward MeCuff, and
John Roggio.

(The X“Ray Room
is operated by Wilbur
Schoonmaker under the
supervision of Sam <And-
rews. Here we find the
latest equipment. The du-
ties of the Technician in-
clude the taking of X-
Rays. All new men, upon
entering, are X-Rayed
here. There are approxi-
mately 800 pictures taken each year. I was advised
that all types of X-Rays were taken within the past
