values to give their children the proper moral educa-
tion. The ones that are morally and academically
inclined are handicapped by their sense of guilt re-
garding the natural functions of life.

It has often been said, that: “In order to label any-
thing as obscene, you must first have conscious aware-
ness of what specifically constitutes the particular
obscenity. And if you have a predetermined visual
image, then you have committed the very obscenity
you are condemning.” According to the interpreta-
tions of the Bible, ““A man already sinned for con-
ceiving sinful acts in his mind and heart.’’ Of course,
this is only in the religious sense. Yet, how can we
entrust our lives so sacredly to a few individuals play-
ing God, directing us on what we should read, see,
hear, and perform. This is akin to what we attribute
to Communism, and condemn—yvet, practice every
day!

Many great minds have said: “Man can only round
out a full education by merging many ideas into one
to form the adequate solution.’ The paradox of all
this is the acceptance of things previously considered
obscene, because it was expedient to do so at the
moment. It has reached the point where a great ma-
jority of people today consider the process of pro-
creation (so necessary to continuance of life) ob-
scene. The condemnation of this naturalness points
up the fact of my censure of the methods of todays
censorship.

I hold that a small degree of censorship is neces-
sary. Let's say, if only to steer the young mind from
a great deal of frivolities and direct their energies
academically so that they may be balanced out to
reward them with an economic and domestic happy
order of life. At the same time, broadening the study
of sociology to include man’s natural God-given func-
tions in life. This is being done on a small scale; but
not enough to rid ourselves within the next decade of
timeworn social laws, dictation regarding choice of
action of persons in marriage, learning, and entertain-
ment.

A leading female author wrote these unoriginal
words in a leading magazine, sometime ago: “‘Sup-
pression of natural forces merely forces them under-
ground; expression helps them to assume their natural
place in life.”’

Dr. Albert Ellis wrote in one of his numerous pub-
lished works the following: “This continual use of
highly unconventional and highly sexed circum-
stances and characters to spice up today’s mass media
has had a curious boomeranging effect. Where orig-
inally this kind of material was deliberately employed

because it was novel and risque, its frequent employ-
ment has made it lose much of its novelty so that to-
day it is commonplace. But what is commonplace

cannot for very long be felt to be too wrong or
unconventional. Ultimately, therefore, the same ma-

terial that is employed because it is not acceptable or
right becomes by its very employment at least tacitly
acceptable.”

Censorship, in this manner, is equally on a par with
other forms of limited freedom. When we endeavor
to limit a man to what we think is necessary for him
to read, then we are literally making him a human
vegetable. This necessitates the thought that these
people, resorting to such methods, are really afraid.
Perhaps afraid of their own inadequacies?

It is within the framework of society that we must
conform to certain rules and regulations necessary to
the order of life and structural well being. The job
he sought to deify is perverted at the expense of the
very persons he is paid to protect. Such is the case of

the censcrs who deem it necessary in certain positions
to curb the individual’s choice of reading, seeing, and

listening to whatever he thinks is necessary for his
own particular learning or enjoyment. Sometimes
this can be partially rationalized due to lawful obliga-
tions.

This idea, though totally unfounded in principle,
is partially true. People have always used intelligence
as a weapon of survival. This is a natural thing in-
herent in all men. ““The will to survive with knowl-
edge as the stimulus.’’ The old proverb, ““The wicked
flee when no man pursueth,”’ appropriately describes
this fearfulness. Some individuals have tried to apply
censorship of words under the guise to ““TOO CON-
TROVERSIAL.” This is a term frequently used in

penal institutions to exercise control over the mind by
limiting their ability to know. There is nothing written

that is not controversial or subject to controversy.
The Bible is considered the greatest instrument in
shaping character. Yet, it really isn’t understood even
in our modern-day society. The greatest minds in the
world have debated its controversial content. It has
been an ever increasing struggle between science and
its pragmatic views, and religion and its view of con-
ceptionalism. Thus we are beginning to see in brevity,
refutation against some of the weak, illogical defenses
for the suppression of man and defender of self:
Man, in his struggle to curb certain unlawful acts,
has let the importance of his duty veer his logical
thinking actions, until they have begun to envelop life
in every phase. Even to intrude upon the sanctity of
the home—wman’s haven of shelter for rest, peace and
love.
