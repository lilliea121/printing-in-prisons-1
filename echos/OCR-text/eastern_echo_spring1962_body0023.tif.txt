odds it is rewarding to know that there are those
who have not only found a new way of life, but by
their example are a eredit to their church, much to
the dismay of the cynics.

Making Our Children Suffer

Rev. A. D. Williams

Protestant Chaplain

“My greatest crime,” said one of my friends, “is
not the deed I did per se, not against society, but is
against my helpless children.” Then, the friend went
on to say, “I know that the children will have to live
with the shame of having a father who spent time in
prison, but even more is the fact that I have given
them a bad example. No matter how long I live I can
mevere welll ime 1© Clo as I cicl”

A man recently sued the telephone company for
$10,000 for leaving his name out of their directory.
He claimed that this omission would cause him to lose
both money and prestige. Often, the sins of omission
are more grave than those of commission. This friend
of mine was thinking of the fact he had neglected to
set a wholesome example for his children. He re-
called that they were helpless to choose their father,
but had thrust upon them a man who was vulgar, ill-
bred and heartless.

Then too, the contagion of evil will likely attack
his children. We can be inoculated against virulent
attack but not against scurrilous attack against our
children, because of our shortcomings.

God has said in the ten Commandments that He is
a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers up-
on the third and fourth generation of them that hate
me: and showing no merey unto thousands of them
that love me and keep my Commandments. Often-
times we have to pay four-fold for our sins.

Let us give two illustrations—one from the Old
Testament and one from the New Testament. The
Old Testament illustration is that of David. If you
wish to see how four of his sons were murdered for
the one murder David committed read these refer-
enoeg: last Clailc—2% Sem, W4sl523, Secomel ~ Senin,
Sto Chay, 2 Sev, 1S 9-33, Mowe, I iarnes 23 1825),

In the new Testament read how Zacchaeus felt that
he must pay four-fold for cheating his fellowman—
st. Luke Chapter 19.

The history books of the old Testament over and
over show that when the father had done evil, he and
his entire family were put to death. When we sow a

wind we must expect to reap a. whirlwind. (Hosea-
She)

Eastern Echo

Jeremiah tells that the fathers have eaten sour
grapes and the children’s teeth shall be put on edge.
(Jer. 31:29.) It remains true today. Whatsoever a
man soweth, that shall he also reap.

The other side of this picture is encouraging to
those who obey God—“‘for he will show mercy unto
thousands of (our children) them that love God and
keep his commandments.” (Exodus 20:6.) We fathers
must think of ways to overcome the harm we do our
children.

The Edge of Life

Dr. Victor Solomon
Jewish Rabbi

A devoted father wished to take his children on a
journey to the mountains. What concerned him was
the dangerous precipice which the taxi would have to
navigate before it reached its destination. He was,
understandably, anxious to hire the most proficient
driver for the trip.

Going to the taxi-stand, he intervied the first driv-
er he met. “How close can you drive to the precipice
on route 35 without falling over’? he inquired. “I
could manage with twelve inches to spare,” was the
answer. Turning to the second driver he asked, “How
close to the edge can you drive with assurance?” “Oh,
I feel safe even six inches from the edge,” was the
reply. Then he turned to the third driver and asked
the same question—‘Sir,” he answered, “I really don’t
know because I would never trust myself to drive
anywhere near the edge.” The happy father had
found the man he would trust to drive his precious
family.

Many of us race through hfe dangerously close to
the abyss of self-annihilation. We drive ourselves
hard and take dangerous chances hoping for the
morrow—which may never come. We permit our-
selves to skirt the precipice of spiritual destruction,
thinking that there are always a few inches to spare
—that there is always time. We neglect our duties
as parents and our responsibilities to make our peace
with God. How many of us leave our religion for a
far off day for the sake of fast living, thinking that
there is plenty of time.

No one knows how late it really is. No one really
knows how close he is to spiritual as well as material
disaster. The wise man, like the prudent driver will
never tempt fate, never drive too close to the edge.
He will always leave a margin of faith and practice
which will assure him safe passage through life. @
