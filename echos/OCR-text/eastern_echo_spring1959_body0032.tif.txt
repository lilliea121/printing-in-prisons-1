Management's Part
in Modern Penology

out of it. The initial reaction to this principle is that
it has a threatening tone about it, but a little ex-
planation alters the threatening tone to something
else. This is a promise. It is a guarantee to the com-
petent people in an organization that the manage-
ment will remove incompetent people before they
ruin the entire program.

You cannot tap a man’s pride of achievement
unless the job bites him if he doesn’t perform com-
petently. It is equally essential that he have the
rewards if he does it competently. And in the re-
lationship I’m describing, there won’t be any ques-
tion about the reward’s being identified with him.
He knows he is the one who did it without any inter-
ference from anyone else. If the job is good, he gets
the credit. If it is consistently bad, he should be
replaced by a more competent man.

INTEGRITY

There is one other element. It is not of the same
nature as the three I have mentioned, but it is the
eord that ties the whole fabric together. There must
be an unquestioned INTEGRITY in the conduct of
business between one individual and another. The
demands on the management for pure objectivity
are aS great as anything they face. Consistency is
an absolute essential to a position of leadership.

Many people short on experience in Modern
Penology and rehabilitative planning, state flatly,

“Tt is impossible to accomplish the goals.” In earlier
prison history there have been transfer of opera-
tions, there had been new buildings, new shifts and
new products. But never before has there existed
the combination of all these factors at one time.

First we must look for personnel who could be
quickly and efficiently developed to form a ecom-
petent core for the new methods of Modern Pen-
ology. The most efficient and promising must be
selected as a nucleus. Many classes must be held
to teach an understanding on the necessity of an
effective philosophy. And, as the Modern Penology
grows the values of understanding the objectives,
delegating the authority and being accountable for
the result, must be transmitted throughout the
group. Every man must know his portion of the job
and pursue it according to his own means.

Each institution must chart programs. Training
programs must involve homework, discussions and
competitive examinations, alternated with on- the-
job experience in the department of their specialty.
Subjects covered in this training program must
include, Correctional officers’ responsibilities, prison
history, rehabilitation objectives, personnel prac-

- tices, individual morale and improvement of methods.

Against this background, I can tell you that our
management philosophy can play a large role in this
program. It can be summed up simply. The AU-
THORITY to do the job must be granted to the peo-
ple who have to do it. The OBJECTIVES involved
must be clearly understood. Every one must know
that he is ACCOUNTABLE for his part.

Though I feel strongly about this program of
Modern Penology, I realize that it represents only a
small portion of the subject discussed. But the im-
plications are great. Extension of these simple pre-
cepts into all types of Modern Penology activities
can have real meaning in our future. — THE END

THE J. WILLIAM WHITE AWARD

In the early part of this century, Dr. J. William
White, was a resident physician in ESP and later
became a member of the Board of Inspectors. In his
will, he provided that a certain amount of money be
placed in trust to be used by the institution for the
prisoner whose term expired during the year; who
had undergone his first term of penal servitude,
whether here or in any other prison; who was under
25 years of age or over 65 years of age and who was
selected by the authorities as most deserving and
most likely to be of permanently honest ways. This
man was to be given the income of the fund. Dr.
White did this in remembrance of his service as a
resident physician and later as inspector of this
institution,

It appears that this fund did not become op-

erative until after the death of Mrs. White in 1925.

This fund has been reactivated and the Girard
Trust Corn Exchange Bank is the present trustee
and under the terms of the recent adjudication it is
our procedure to certify to the Commissioner wha
shall receive this award. This will be an annual
award and, for the year 1958, Superintendent
William J. Banmiller certified that Louis DiLelia be
awarded the $100, because in the Institutional
Staff's opinion he met the conditions of Dr. White's
will.

Each year, therefore, the staff will recommend
the individual whose term has expired’ during the
year and this, in turn, shall be forwarded by the
Superintendent to the Commissioner, who will
certify the name of the nominee to the trustee for
the award.
