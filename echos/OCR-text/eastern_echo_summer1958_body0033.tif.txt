I CAN MAKE IT ALONE IF AND WHEN

[BUT WHY ?] If I weep, let my tears be for others
To make my way, throughout each day, If I laugh, let me laugh with thee

Alone and friendless, yet proud;

Needing no one, beneath the Sun,

If I hate, let me hate my shortcomings
If I love, let my love flow free.
If I lie, let it be a wee white one

Jf I pain, let me not show the strain

Alone, in the midst of a crowd;

If I sigh, let my sighs be love sighs

Smothering each doubt, with a selfish shout, Uf I die, let it not be in vain.
When I pray, let my prayers not be selfish

““T can make tt alone!’’

When I sing, let my songs be to you

(But why?) When I sin, may my sins be forgiven
And when and if these hopes come true

Should I hide my tears and mask my fears,

I’ll feel that my life was not squandered

And has proved it’s dedication to you.

And be earefree when there is others around?
When I’m out of sight, in the still of the night,

And my mask of pretense is down ;
Should I-sigh to myself, and lie to myself
““T can make it alone!’’

(Tell me why?)

Why? yes, why? must I make it alone?
Alone without friends, falsely proud;
No man is complete, in egoistic conceit,
He is ever a part of that crowd;
A cog, I feel, in humanities wheel,
Ver 9. re cam make 1) alone:

(Not I.)

With false pride on the shelf, less thought of self,
I advance with a helping hand;

For only in sharing, assisting, and caring,
JUDGEMENT

Pass me not in review,
Before your judgement stand
Joe IL ann omky ome . . 5 Ose i Sure, — ‘‘I can make it alone,’’
Bewilderment’s land

And alone merit not your time or scorn.

Can I ask others to understand ;

(But why ??)

BY JESSE BURCH

I shall know in the end, that I’ve been a friend,

There are countless more to come, BY JESSE BURCH

As yet unborn

What things I have done to bring me here
Cannot be credited to your wiles or schemes
So let me walk with bowed head

And reap the harvest.of my dreams POE j R :
Your’s cannot be the thorny path, that crooked goes

For I, alone, ean feel this worlds punishing woes.
