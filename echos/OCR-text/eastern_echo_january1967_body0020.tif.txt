were incapable of professional evaluation, but they
did disclose a pretty bad double fracture of the two
bones in her lower left leg, and severe dislocations
of the right ankle and shoulder. My nervous, fum-
bling fingers continued their probing and discovered
additional fractures of both the left and right rib
cage. There was no way for me to determine
whether she had incurred any serious internal inju-
ries, but I was able to estimate that she was in
critical condition and deep shock.

I applied a crude pressure bandage to the
flowing head cut and set and splinted the leg as

well as I could. After I strapped her shoulder and
ankle, I tried to figure out what else I could do for

the present, vehemently cursing my limited first aid
knowledge. I did know that 1 would need the mor-
phine ampules and the antibiotics | had managed to
cajole out of my old family doctor and friend before
I left for the city. I didn’t think I should move the
girl right away, so I had Bo stay with her while |
went back to my cabin to pick up everything I
would need, as long as we had to camp by the big
oak.

That night and all the next day, except for an
occasional groan or sharp cry of pain, she lay in a
heavy coma. The head wound had stopped bleed-
ing, so | removed the pressure bandage and cut her
blood matted hair as short as possible and stitched
up her torn scalp. I cut away her ragged, blood
stained clothing, laying bare the deep purple bruises
that mapped her torso from head to toe, a testimony
to the severe battering she had taken. It was a grim-
ly brutal sight to behold, and for the first time I was
shocked by the realization that the girl might not
live, and surprised by my concern.

I tried to spoon hot venison broth into her
at spaced intervals, but had very little success. When
two whole days passed without any noticeable
change, it became apparent that her already long
siege of unconsciousness was to be extended, so |
decided to take her to the cabin. I scaled the oak and
disassembled the plane’s landing wheels, and by
lashing some loose pine boughs and deer hides to the
wheel frames, I was able to fashion a carrying cart
of sorts.

Transporting her from the crash area to my
cabin involved a great deal of difficulty. I was
dismayed by the several hours of arduous dragging
and maneuvering it took to pull the bulky vehicle
over the jagged rocks and through thick brush,
in order to complete the comparatively short
journey to the cabin. Although the woman did not
revive, she did moan several times from the jolting
ride, in spite of the extra precaution I took to ease
the trip for her comfort. I was thoroughly relieved

and completely exhausted when I finally bedded
her down in my large bunk. After I force fed her
some more broth, and assured Bo that everything
was all right, I gathered some furs together on the
floor, curled up in the middle of them, and slept
the sleep of the dead for twelve solid hours.

I came back to life about a half hour before |
awoke, with a frenzied mixture of nightmarish
dreams. To begin with, I kept visualizing my Aunt’s
and Uncle’s death scene over and over again, al-
though I had never actually seen it. The vision re-
appeared with amazing clarity, until my subcon-
csious mind became flogged with the gory spectacle
and immediately switched me over to the conference
room of the advertising agency where | had worked.
Somehow in my twisted ramblings, I had become
chairman of the board, and the fat Director who had
snubbed me, and his worthless nephew were offer-
ing pleading gestures to me. I never really deter-
mined what they were begging for, because before
I could deal out a fiendish punishment to them, |
found myself in the middle of Beverly's familiar
living room clad only in a leopard skin, and holding
a long bull whip in my hand.

I unfurled the wicked implement with a crack-
ling snap, and at once, Beverly responded to the
dreadful cue. She immerged from her bedroom with
lithe gracefulness, and assumed a defiant stance
about fifteen feet away from me. No words were
spoken, but my mission was clear. I lashed out at
her again and again and relished her muted agony,
as I watched the long leather thong coil itself around
her naked beauty, and bite deep red ravines into
her downy flesh.

It wasn’t until | had exhausted my wrath and
she examined the lattice work of bloody weals that
she reacted to my vindictiveness. Then her anguish-
ed screams flooded the room, rolling off the ceiling
and bouncing off the walls with shattering, suffocat-
ing impact. Her trembling body never moved.

I dropped the whip, wanting more than any-
thing else in that eerie world to flee from the echo-
ing screams. I ran for the outside door, but it was
gone. All the doors were gone, and the windows
too We were trapped in a cube; me in the leopard
skin and Beverly in the bloody raw.

She stopped screaming then, but never moved,
watching me grope along the solid walls, feeling
for an opening. Any opening. The maddening
noise had subsided, but I still had a terrible urgency
to get away. My savage revenge had been overly ful-
