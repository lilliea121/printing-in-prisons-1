sion is made for one? I think the people trained in
the behavioral sciences, Psychiatrist, Penologist,
Psychologist and Sociologist, should be given a more
prominent place in all phases of correctional work in
prison. This is not to suggest the officials who have
spent considerable time in prison work haven’t per-
formed in accordance with methods and ideas open
to them under the existing system, but it should be
abundantly clear by now that the present way of do-
ing things has failed miserably.

Once all the facets of rehabilitation are imple-
mented and coordinated, I have no doubt the results
will justify the money spent and efforts put forth.

It is a dilemma to be sure but one that must be
solved if the problems of rehabilitation are to be sur-
mounted, and recidivism reduced.

Half measures we got already! What is really
needed is a dedicated commitment to rehabilitation.

It has been said that time heals all wounds. In
this case It ain’t necessarily so!

On January 22, 1966, the United States
Court of Appeals in the Fourth Circuit declared
that ‘“‘the State cannot stamp an unpretending
alcoholic as a criminal if his drunken public dis-
play is involuntary as the result of disease.”’

Two months later, the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia held that chronic alco-
holies may not be punished or Jailed as criminals
for being drunk in public, although they may be
ordered to undergo medical treatment.

Dissent and Protest
by Thomas Williams

In advanced countries laws are made and admin-
istered by that sociological institution known as the
state; which, of course, is responsible for the preser-
vation of law and order and the administration of
justice. The people defer to the state, arbitration of
erievances where such grievances tend to affect the
community at large. The maintaining of stable,
social institutions and the people’s right to protest
these same institutions when they inadequately serve
them, is the historical dilemma of democratic
societies.

A method frequently used to challenge institutions
and systems thought to be unjust, is dissent and pro-
test. In recent times, many have been led to believe
that dissent and protest is a fundamental wrong. Not
so. These methods are fundamental and are consti-
tutionally guaranteed rights, nailed down in Article
I of the Bill of Rights:

“Congress shall make no laws respecting an
establishment of religion or prohibiting the
free exercise thereof; or abridging the free-

dom of speech or of the press; or of the
people peaceably to assemble and to peti-
tion the Government for a redress of griev-
ances.”

There is an age old misconception accepted by
many people which lends itself to the theory of abso-
lutism. The misconception lies in the thought of an
individual’s position in the state or federal govern-
ment entitling him to strict immunity from errors in
decision making, irrational behavior, despotism and
the like. This misguided thinking by citizens have
created the illusion that a public office be it state or
government is private domain, in which censure
plays no part for actions contrary to the best inter-
est of a nation.

It is not surprising when these public officials be-
come incensed at protest levied against their actions.
They have enjoyed unresticted freedom for so long,
the natural reaction displayed by many is displeas-
ure and rebelliousness against dissent and/or pro-
test. Their aversion to change can be rationalized
but not condoned.
