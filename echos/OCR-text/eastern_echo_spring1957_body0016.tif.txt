THE
YOUNG MAN
WHO SMILED

by Harold George Shadd

Just ag the tall young man in the conservative
grey business suit reached the crosswalk, the traffic
light flicked from green to red. The delay caused
a glimmer of annoyance to play fleetingly over his
sharp, handsome features. He glanced briefly at his
watch and then stared resignedly at the traffic
roaring past. His grey eyes followed the swirling
poisonous blue exhaust fumes heavenward until they
found the brilliant June sun burning a cloudless sky.

He sighed deeply and then pulled his handker-
chief from his breast pocket. Casually he dabbed
at the perspiration gathering on his broad forehead.

The light blinked green and he followed the
bustling crowd across the street. He walked more
slowly now, carefully eyeing the numbers above the
entrances to the office buildings. ‘‘1821 ... 1828 .
. . 13825. This is the one,” he thought, and then
strode through the entrance.

His eyes ran quickly over the main foyer and
then found the phone booths tucked against the rear

wall. He turned and walked quickly to the cigar
counter.

‘May I have some change, please?’’ he asked.
His voice was soft with just a hint of the south cares-
sing his words.

‘‘Sure thing, mister,’’ the attendant, an old man
said, and gave the young man some silver coins.

The young man jingled the loose change as he
hurried to the phone booth.

He entered a booth and closed the door. He
seated himself and then pulled a small note book
from an inner pocket. Carefully he studied its
pages and, after finding the number he was hunting,
he inserted a coin and dialed.

He could hear the buzzing ring on the other
end of the line. His fingers drummed a nervous
tattoo on the tiny counter. His lips pursed and
he quietly whistled a nameless tune.

And then the voice.

‘“Acme Construction Company.’’

‘“May I speak to Miss Naney Wable?’’ he asked
softly.

‘*One moment, please.’’

The young man pursed his lips and softly
whistled his nameless tune. He could hear a click
as an extension was plugged into an open line.

‘‘This is Miss Wable speaking.’’

‘‘Miss Naney Wable?’’ the young man asked.

‘‘Miss Wable, you don’t know me but I’m a
friend of Bill Jennings. Went to college together.
Bill thought it would be all right if I called when
I got into town. Sort of introduce myself. I hope
you don’t mind,’’ he said anxiously.

“‘Well...no,’’ the girl replied.

‘‘Good. Look, Miss Wable, I realize you’re prob-
ably quite busy and I don’t want to keep you from
your work. Would... would you have lunch with
me? It would give us more time to talk.’’

‘All right,’’ Miss Wable replied.

And then the young man smiled. He didn’t
know it but Miss Wable was thinking how pleasant
his voice sounded. It would be nice to see what he
looked like.

‘*My lunch hour begins at one o’clock,’’ she said.

“‘Fine,’’ the young man replied. ‘‘I’ll wait for
you in the main foyer.’’ Then the click told him the
line was dead.

He left the phone booth and walked back to the
cigar counter where he bought a package of cigarettes.
He opened the pack, put a cigarette between his lips
and then glanced at his watch.

‘‘Fifteen minutes,’’ he muttered as he flipped his
lighter open. He touched flame and drew the smoke
