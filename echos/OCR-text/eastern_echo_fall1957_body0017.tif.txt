pigeon would go, propelled as if by sheer will power
alone. Then, unable to stay aloft, he came bumping,
slipping, sliding, tumbling to the hard ground.
Gathering himself together, scarcely resting a
moment, but striving to control what remained of
his poor wings, he whirled and tried again... and
again... and still again.

““We oughta put it out of its misery,’’ spoke the
tallest in the group as Russ approached.

‘‘No,’’ said another. ‘‘I’m betting the boys in
the Alley can save this bird.’’

‘“‘They couldn’t make a new set of wings!
Nobody e’n, or there’d a been a couple two-legged
jailbirds missing count long before this.’’

‘Trish, this bird sure reminds me of that stub-
born-headed MacGregor. Didn’t they say he’d
never make it? But, he did, didn’t he, Irish?’’

“Yeah, after fifteen years filing writs of
habeas: corpuses.’’ -Irish rubbed his chin. ‘‘Sure
an’ it’d be a fittin’ monicker for this game bird

While these comments circulated among the
men, Russ had been edging nearer the pigeon.
Closer and closer he cautiously moved, mindful not
to frighten the bird further. As it once more
desperately beat its wings to stay aloft, Russ caught
it just before it would strike the rough corner stones.

Out of the sweat of perseverance and the sweet
sugar of patience, such is the stuff miracles are
made of.

For through long, tedious, trial-and-error hours
spelling into days and weeks, Russ, Billy, Dave and
Big Bakey labored. Discarded feathers gathered
from around brick walks and exercise yard were
carefully accumulated. Pigeon-guests dropping in
for a leisure lunch contributed one if not two plumes.
All underwent a pearl-buyer’s scrutiny, screened
and selected for weight, color and length.

To restore the mutilated wings their uncorked
talent woud have eredited our legendary masters
of ingenuity. Not only had weight and size of
feathers, along with their perfect matching, counted.
But, of utmost importance was the arranging of each
plume so that when MacGregor’s reflexes signaled,
action, every wing feather would spread symmetri-
cally and hold firmly.

Cleaned and serubbed dowel sticks picked for

their fiber sturdiness, Russ sanded and shaped to
micrometer exactness. Quills to be used, Big
Bakey trimmed at the tips just sufficient to insert
bracing sticks that were freshly dipped in glue.
Opening quill-casings on the pigeon’s wings one by
one, Dave wedged in the dowel stick attached with a
redeemed feather. Swiftly Billy sealed off the
incisions with cement, then bandaged and tied each
wing quill securely in place.

And the battle was on... the constant watchful
effort to keep MacGregor from pecking the bandages
loose. From the pained expressions, it seemed to
hurt the men more than the bird to be laced in a
sort of strait-jacket contraption till the glue set.

There were moments when MacGregor’d sit
on Russ’s bullet-maimed arm and, wings drooping,
peer with such wistful longing at the little patch of
blue glimpsed through the narrow window over-
head, plainly saying: ‘‘Please, Friend, won’t I
ever fly again?’’

Finally, when the last bandage had been re-
moved, MacGregor craned and craned his scrawny
neck to admire these new wings. But, the doubtful
gleam in his golden eyes remained, evident for all

t

to see. Beauty was one thing and flying another.
More than anything else he yearned to fly again.

The Sunday afternoon before commencement of
the season’s terminating baseball game Big Bakey
had suggested as grand take-off day for the gallant
MacGregor.

Oh, he was a pretty handsome fellow, now, as
his four benefactors stood back admiring his strut
deep in left field. Full, grey, ankle-length trousers,
brushed and pressed, enhanced his v-shaped black
cutaway coat. Across light-grey tail and tapering
wingtips, two black ribbon streaks stretched their
distinguishing marks like those adorning royal court
members.

For a suspenseful moment, MacGregor pecked
industriously at stray pebbles, Suddenly, with a
loud flap of powerful wings, up... up he flew!
Then, seemingly twitching his beautiful, fan-spread
plumage in farewell salute, he sailed gracefully
over prison walls.

It is said not even the fall of a tiny sparrow goes
unnoticed, leading to the strong belief that Good
Samaritan acts find recognition Up There.

‘But, down here, if ‘‘ All the world’s a stage,’’.
as Shakespeare eloquently declares in As You Like
It, then along its crowded fringe Russ, Dave, Billy
and Big Bakey—these four rate a generous round of
applause from their fellow actors.
