Here is a sample of the trend of these attacks,
taken from a Philadelphia Daily editorial that was
published on December 11, 1958. ‘‘Why should
Leader save murderers from the Hlectric Chair or
Commute Life Sentenees?’’ Yes, that was the
question posed. Inasmuch as there was no attempt
to supply the answer, we can only assume they are
ignorant of the facts concerning the ramifications of
a sentence commutation. To launch an _ attack,
editorially, without all of the pertinent facts is
similar to launching a Guided Missile without its
integral parts. Either one can result in a dangerous
explosion.

AE ibe implication of the above quoted question,
leads the uninformed to believe that Mr. Leader, in
a spirit of magnanimity, can—and does—at his own
diseretion, without the recommendation of officials
versed in Penology, Psychology, Education, Psychia-
try and Custody, choose a few names at random from
the Fleshpots of prisons, and decides that he shall
release them. So deciding, he acts and they are
released. But, fortunately for you in free society,
it isn’t possible. The Governor of the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania, does not have such power. Our
legislators, who conceived and developed the system
of Pardons, Commutations and Parole, were learned
men. They were not newspaper reporters, that is
true. However, they were learned men in their own
field. Before introducing our present Penal System,
they studied the correctional methods utilized from
5000 B.C., to date. The adjustments and corrections
made in the Penal System of our State are too
numerous to mention. However, the current system
is founded on the basis that it is more in keeping with
our age of civilization and democratic nature to save
a man, than it is to destroy one. Individual counsel-
ing, therapy and reeducation are the methods of cor-
rection being applied. The effectiveness of this
program exceeds any system that has ever been
devised in the past. It is directed toward the com-
plete rehabilitation of the individual, by new self-
understanding and insight. The end result being a
constructive, law-abiding citizen. Between the incep-
tion of a convicted offender into a penal institution,
and his release by commutation, parole or completion
of his maximum sentence, he is subjected to an intense
series of microscopic tests and close supervision. ‘To
be able to deceive the battery of Custodial Officers,
Job Supervisors, Psychiatrists, Psychologists, and
other officials as to his mental attitude, and personal
demeanor is exceptional. We admit, that it has
been done. However, the percentage of failures
compiled on men on parole is insignificant when
associated with the percentage who have justified the
faith of the penal authorities. It is unfortunate that
the newspapers did not see fit to permit its readers
the benefit of these percentages derived from research.
If such percentages had been presented, it would have
been in keeping with the platform of one of the
papers which reads (in part) “to be just, to be fair

Eastern Echo

and above all to be unswervingly independent.”
However, it may have been an oversight on their
part. Therefore, we shall present some interesting
facts to be considered. I shall quote. from “The
Quality Of Merey” by Andre L. Paschedag, as pub-
lished in the Summer Edition of The Eastern Echo,
15S.

“In a less emotional approach we have available
statistics which concern themselves with a group of
murderers who entered the Eastern State Peniten-
tiary between 1900 and 1950.

“During that period 621 “lifers” were received,
of which 89 were transferred to other institutions,
and their subsequent fate unknown. Of the remain-
ing 532, 76 or 14% died in prison, 59 or 11% were
transferred to the Hospital for the Criminally In-
sane, and 113 or 21% are still serving time at this
institution. In other words, 46% of the men have
not seen freedom since their sentencing. Not all
murderers are immediately released to run the
streets, aS Some newspapers would have you believe.

“And what of those who are paroled? Of the
original group of 5382, 284 were paroled as of this
printing. Only 21 or 7% have violated the terms of
their parole and been returned to prison. A further
breakdown demonstrates that of the men convicted
between 1940 and 1950 and subsequently released on
parole, none have been returned as violators.”

In relation to the release of all men placed on
parole I shall quote from a letter received from
Paul J. Gernert, Chairman, Pennsylvania Board of
Parole.

‘At the close of the year on May 31, 1957, there
were 5,345 parolees under active supervision (not
counting 57 cases deported.) Of this number 4,401
or 82.3% were in good standing and 944 or 17.7%
were delinquent either as unconvicted violators, con-
victed violators, or absconders.”

Just think, 4,401 of these men were men who
justified the faith of the Parole Board’s decision.
This is a much brighter picture than our local news-
papers present.

A prisoner released on parole is subject to
parole restrictions until expiration of his maximum
sentence. For a lifer, this would technically be until
he died.

W. wish to establish the faets concerning the
commutation of a man’s prison sentence. Before a
man is permitted to apply for commutation, he must
have an exemplary prison record of conduct. He
must submit papers to the Pardon Board, two months
before his case is to be heard, supplying all infor-
mation relative to his crime and information as to
where he will reside if commutation is granted. The
case is placed in the hands of the Parole Department,
who investigate the particulars and confer with the
battery of prison officials who have had the individual
under close surveillance. The District Attorney’s
