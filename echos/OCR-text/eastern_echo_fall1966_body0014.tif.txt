Tool & Repair Crib — Mechanical difftculties, break-
downs and general maintenance of all print shop ma-
chinery and equipment are the responsibility of the ma-
chinist-mechanic. Raymond Wade (left), specializing in
linotype repair, and James Land (right) are the ‘trouble-
shooters’ of the print shop, fulfilling aforesaid duties and
others that include remelting lead into ingots and stereo-
typing for composing room needs, ordering and stocking
spare parts for all machines, tool making and tool design.

Paper & Cutting Department — Paper has a definite
function in the complete job. It is an integral part of the
picture. Paper is the portion of the job which adds a
third dimension—-depth (thickness). Nearly all paper
used is made of wood pulp, but writing papers are made
principally of cotton and linen rags. Most paper comes
under the five general heads of news print, book papers,
writing papers, covers, and cardboards. An economic
cut-out from the size of paper available must be kept in
mind when choosing paper. A good paper cutter main-
tains a minimum amount of waste. Pictured from left to

Weathers.
