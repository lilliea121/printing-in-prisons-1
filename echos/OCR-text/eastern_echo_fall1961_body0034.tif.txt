coming up. Another bad break was the transfer of
Billy Hollowell to Rockview.

Leading the Falcons attack was Bill (No No)
Smith who captured the imagination of the fans
with his repertoire of fancy pitches and indominable

spirit. Behind the plate, Sonny Mays kept the op-
posing base-runners honest with a rifle-like throw to

second. Sonny was also the Falcons big stick and
led the league in total fourbaggers. First base was

a weak spot and cost this team several games. In
an attempt to plug the dyke Shep moved from
third and played first himself. However, this was
only a partial remedy as Shep was definitely the best
third sacker on the Falcons and left that position
weak. Bill Perry moved into the vacancy and while
he did a fine job it was too late as the Falcons were
too far back to overtake the leaders.
the infield was strong as Harry Zeitz did an excel-
lent job at shortstop, while John Wheeler held down
the second base sack with the authority of experi-
ence. In the outfield Danny Gundaker was very
poised for a rookie and held his own at the plate.
With the addition of Rocky Landers, the catchers
job was eased somewhat and Sonny Mays was put
into left field. Rocky did a good job in keeping up
the standard that Mays had set.
given to Don McGinley who was obtained in a trade
with Detroit and Big Don gave it all he had to nail
down a starting spot. Norman Pearson, looked

like his old self in short field where he covered more:

ground than some of his younger counterparts. Norm
alee had a fine stick and broke up at least one ball
game with a timely shot through the hole. Two
more examples of ‘‘too late’’ were Jake Welty and
C. Pitts. Both of these men joined the team late in
the season and had their bats been on hand sooner
a lot of applecarts could have been upset. Backing
up the pitching of No No was Willie Green who has
a fine fast ball and should develop into a pitcher of
note should he remain in these parts.

With a perennial twenty game winner, Shorty
Jordan, on the mound, things were looking good for
the Braves at the start of the season. However, the
team ran into a hitting slump and they got off to a
late. start. Jordan not only retained his “‘riser’’
from last year but also added a new pitch, a slow
ball. His battery mate, Rob Watson, played heads-
up ball and between the two of them they had en-
emy batters cutting at air. One of the old timers of
Easterns sport wars, Tom (Heads) Brawner, held
down first base and was as tricky as a fox at the
plate. If first base was a problem for the other
teams, second was an even worse headache for the
Braves. Again it was a story of “‘too late’ as Jor-

dan finally secured the services of a competent

second sacker, F. Bordner. Third base was less of
a problem as Joe Massanova gave a good account
of himself both on the field and at the plate.

The Detroit Tigers — The Tigers got off toa
poor beginning; losing their first six games. How-
ever, the arrival of Bob Cullen from the rookie lea-
gue gave the Tigers new impetus and for awhile they
burned up the league. The main difficulty with the
‘Tigers seemed to be:a lack of seriousness on several
of the players parts. Certainly they had a wealth of
material. Behind the plate, John Alexander was no
stripling but still had the agility to compete with the
youngsters -in addition to having a strong hitting
game. L. Jason started the season in the outfield
but was moved to first base late in the season where
he adjusted to the change in a good manner.

R. Hawkins possessed great potential but could-
n't seem to get started. His play at second was defin-
itely not up to the calibre he was capable of, though
he still had a good stick.’ ‘The shortstop’s job was in
good hands as Bob Gerlack demonstrated his abil-
ity with the glove. Another player brought up
from the Storehouse League, Willie Green, displayed
flashes of brilliance but had some trying moments at
the plate. aN little s€asoning ‘should have Willie re-
garded as one of the best. Bob Johnson was called
up to play first and turned in a splendid perform-
ance while he was around, but a trip to Graystone
Manor crimped his career. Junior gave a good ac-
count of himself: at the plate but was in for tough
luck in the field.;. John Gilmore took over as man-
ager and while he did a good job, might have had
better luck if he had taken out one of the regulars
and inserted himself in the line-up. Gilmore show-
ed that he still swings a mighty bat and is to be
feared at the plate... Franny McLaughlin had an
arm broken during the football season and was not
up to par but still managed to make a good showing
on the field. M:. Dickerson covered an awful lot of
ground for a rookie’and will bé besieged by scouts
next season. C. Harry, Ol’ Bubbles that is, proved
that he is not ready to be put out to pasture and was
a ‘steady team man.
