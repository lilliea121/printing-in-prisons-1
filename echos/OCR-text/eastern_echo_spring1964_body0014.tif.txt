sponsibilities to his clients are too crucial to expect
him to be an equal adversary to the prosecution,
without more actual experience under courtroom con-
ditions with seasoned counsel to aid him.

It is possible in some professions to apply the
teachings of the book directly to the task, but due to
the uniqueness of each felony case, this cannot be
done in law, and the novice lawyer should not be
expected to do it. Law schools and lawyers say much
more about how law should work than about how it
actually works. The greatest way in the world to im-
press the importance of equitable law is, in some way,
to show and make the lawyer feel what it really means
to lose his freedom. No amount of study can convey
this horror. It is significant that it takes the lawyer
many, many years to feel and know the humility jus-
tice strives to practice, all too often with sad results.

Believe it or not, most lawyers are proud of the
cultured, the esteemed image that snail paced reform
measures take; they point with pride to antiquated,
obsolete and medieval practices still on the books.
And while claiming sole possession of the Holy
Grail they will resort to incredulous ingenuity to sup-
press the truth if the truth is injurious to their cause.
They even write books describing any opposition wit-
ness automatically as one whose veracity must at all
cost be destroyed whether he speaks the truth or
not. One recent gem of ethics has a section titled,
“How to Humiliate and Subdue a Recalcitrant Wit-
ness. A very noble and divinely inspiring work to

say the least. (Text by Lewis W. Lake. )

Recognition of legal failures is in itself not enough.
A concentrated program is needed with periodic
evaluation of the progress made. Or as in the case of
most creditable resolutions this program will just fade
away as with Old Soldiers. Every day the Federal
Government becomes more and more involved in the
enforcement of State Legislation. Every day the Fed-
eral Government enters more and more into the
State’s regulatory procedure and creates federal stat-
utes to legalize this encroachment into what was once
purely state matters. In the past ten years there has
been a very noticeable increase in the activity of the
government criminal investigative and enforcement
agencies in areas which are, or were, strictly the sov-
ereign affairs of each state. Government in a big way
increases the need for close attention to the due pro-
cess clause, for here the defendant is confronted with
the giant of all adversaries. No one can hope to ap-
proach this opponent on equal footing. The only hope
lies in the practice by the government of meticulous
attention to due process. Contrary to government
press releases this is not always the case. The mere
fact that certain agencies proudly proclaim that 98 %

12

of government indictments are followed by convic-
tions should cause a lifted eyebrow here or there. The
mere threat of a federal indictment in many cases has
caused capitulation to federal charges, in view of the
relentless might and everlasting memory of “‘Big
Daddy.”’ No one likes to lose. Not even the Govern-
ment and this must be considered by those con-
fronted by a federal indictment.

Due to the indifference of many lawyers and pol-
iticians the public concept of the legal profession is at
an all-time low. The noble image of liberty and the
respected image of law have become cynical farces in
the eyes of many, and with good reason.

The days of Darrow, Bill Fallon, Earl Rogers,
Liebowitz, Chippy Patterson, Jake Ehrlich and other
colorful legal luminaties which the public admired
and respected because of their dedication to the little
fellow, seems to have passed. The practice of crimi-
nal law has become dry and mechanical, almost with
an impersonal attitude, instead of the vibrant living
and morally satisfying thing it once was.

Finally, and this criticism extends beyond the legal
profession and the apathy many lawyers display to
what we think is the crux of the whole matter; there
is the indifference prevalent in society-at-large. To
these vital responsibilities are owed, to a large extent,
the cause for the general breakdown in morals.

We know, or should know, that we get from a
democracy only that which we zealously cherish and
guard. If we are lax regarding the obligations of
democratic demands, democracy in turn will deny us
its fruits. These words may sound stilted and nobly
abstract, something far from home. Nothing could
be further from the truth. In a democracy, the effect
of indifference is immediate, universal and cata-
strophic.

Possibly we are overly trustful of the wonders of
our democracy and value it too emotionally. If we
are, there is a considerable element of danger in as-
suming it will guide itself, but there is even greater
danger when lawyers allow the intent of law to be-
come, and remain, remiss.

The solution to these problems we leave to qual-
ified experts, but we cannot help wondering if more
conscientious concern by the public, and especially
the lawyers, whatever their field of law may be, in
the administration of criminal justice, and the protec-
tion of dignty of the individual, might in itself be
the answer. The need for new laws is far less impor-
tant than the need for application of proper pro-
cedure in the present ones. It is well for all of us to
remember that true justice treads firmly but fairly.
When it errs it crushes—and any of us may be under-
foot—even you! ®
