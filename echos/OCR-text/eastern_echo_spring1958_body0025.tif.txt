AMERICAN LEAGUE PREDICTIONS
by
CHARLES M. TOBIN

It has often been said: ‘It is only by the past that
you can safely judge the future... ’’ Well, let’s look at
the past. The Yankees have won 23 out of 57 tries for
the pennant bid... This in itself puts my prediction on
solid ground.

YANKEES

Aside from the above fact, the Yankees have old pros
such as cal. “The Barber’ Miaglie “- Yogi’ Berra, and
Enos Slaughter, who carry an environment with them that
spells out team-spirit and loyalty, which is the main factor
of a pennant winning club.

CLEVELAND

Cleveland is my second choice. This club has a pitching
staff to make any team cry and give up hope. MeLeish,
Garcia, Seore and Lemon just to name a few. Their
all around man, Minoso, will no doubt be the driving spirit
behind this fine ball club with Vic Wertz, Wilhelm and
Avila adding fuel to the drive.

WHITE SOX

I look for the White Sox to capture third place, but,
not without a hard fight, put up by the Tigers. Chicago
has a good infield as well as pitching. However, the ques-
tionable department will be their outfield.

DETROIT

The Tigers have top name ball players such as Ray
Boone, Al Kaline, Harvey Kuenn, Charley Maxwell and Jim
Bunning but even at this, I cannot figure this team higher
than fourth place.

RED SOX

Mr. Ted Williams will find his Red Sox in fifth place.
Piersall and Jenson will take the spotlight from ‘‘Mr.
150,000 dollars.’’

BALTIMORE

The Baltimore Orioles are my favorite team and I’ll
be a rooting fan... Yet, I cannot conceive of them outdo-
ing the Red Sox this year. Sure! we have Doby ... but one
man does not make a team.

KANSAS CITY

K. C. and Washington will hold down 7th and 8th
place respectively, but not respectfully. Well, that’s the
way it goes, I suppose.

One thing is certain .

. when the dust clears away
we’ll all be wiser.

NATIONAL LEAGUE PREDICTIONS

Hank ‘The Tank’ our Sports Editor, called my bluff,
namely, by questioning my knowledge of the great American
Sjo@iett, I jomelk . oe

MILWAUKEE, if for no other reason than what they did
to Old Case’s herd. This club is the best balanced outfit
in the league. Now we all know...

CINCINNATI’s trouble is their weak pitching. They
may get some help from Haddix in that department, but
the loss of two big strong bats in the Klu and Post will
hurt, but there is still enough lumber to keep the...
CARDS out of second. This St. Louis mob is loaded with
spirit and hustle, all that youth plus the ‘‘Man’’ will keep
them in contention, ‘‘Pennant in ’60.’’ Maybe the Ripper
will start Ripping for our...

PHILLIES, but Ennis will remain a nightmare and keep
us fighting to hold down fourth, we may have too many
holes and one big IF, ‘‘Robbie.’’ If he comes through we
will surely keep the old gents off our tail...

BROOKLYN. This fifth place spot may be insulting, but
I can’t see how all that smog in L.A. can help the old guys.
Better unload ‘‘Walt’’ and start rebuilding. The air is
cleaner in Frisco and if Rigney keeps ‘‘Say Hey’’ off the
JeeNley) We 5

GIANTS just may not like their sixth place spot. Anyway,
box office receipts should be terrific. Now we come to a
club with a good chief but few indians...
PITTSBURGH will stay out of the cellar only through the
wisdom of Danny Murtaugh. Klu will have a great year.
ast but not least.in the hearts that is vies sea.

CUBS have nothing but can afford to unload Rush. I can’t
figure it but maybe a move to the coast—San Diego would
sell more gum for Mr. Wrigley.

THE MAN BEHIND THE GAME:

Let’s pause for a moment and consider Joe Buzzard,
the man bebind the scenes of all football games. Joe is the
equipment manager... Let’s extend our hand and give him
a well earned pat on the back for a job ‘‘well done’’...
Joe doesn’t share in the glory when a winning touchdown
is made, or the applause on a great play ... Joe just walks
up and down the side lines, knowing each man is well

equipped ... It is his job to issue gear to managers, players
and coaches. There is no bickering with Joe, Joe is boss
and he decides who will get what equipment ... It is not

an easy task, it is a thankless task ... So let us pause now
and say, ‘‘Thanks, Joe, for doing a fine job.’’
