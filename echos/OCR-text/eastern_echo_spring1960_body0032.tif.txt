CRAZY, MAN, CRAZY

IT was 3 A.M. when the Center City prowl ear
pulled up to a tire-sereeching, rubber-burning, siren-
sereaming stop at the entrance to the Center City
Hospital. (You see, it would have been impossible
for the hospital to pull up in a tire-screeching, rub-
ber-burning, siren-screaming stop in front of the
prowl car; it’s plausable.)

Actually, I can’t remember it, but they said I had
been arrested for throwing Japanese Beetles in the
window of Detective Headquarters. (They say it
caused quite a tizzy among the coffee house raiders,
who were resting in anticipation of another raid on
a local chess club. (Loaded Rooks, illegal use of,
See. 4, Par. 2. Article 9, Criminal Code.)

After hours of continued questioning, like, “How
long would it take you to find your way out of a re-
volving door?”—without a seeing-eye dog, of course.
And, “If King Solomen had a thousand wives, why
did he sleep with a Teddy Bear?’—or was it his
Grandfather?

Finally, the cream of the local coffee house
raiders had come to the conclusion that I was num-
ber one on the list of the most in need of a visit to the
Psychiatrie Ward. (One psycho can tell another at
the drop of a couch.) Two of the more intelligent
members of the coffee house raiders (one of them
couldn’t find his own nose with both hands; the other
found it once in three tries) were the left-door-
erasher and the downstairs window-breaker, and
they escorted me to the doctor’s office where I was
introduced to Dr. Ivan Sputnick. (Right away,
quick as a flash, I said to myself, “The dirty spy!”)

“Well,” said the doctor, “what a fine looking
man we have here.”

“What you see is nothing,” I said. I’m getting
an estimate on a haircut tomorrow.”

“O.K.,” the doctor replied, as his mouth shut
with the unnatural softness of a hospital door. (It
could be.) Dr. Sputnick’s face was a bright tomato-
red and as hard as the manager of a loan office. He
had more wrinkles than a neurotic bull-dog; in fact,
he slobbered like one, too. The veins of his face
showed through in fine lines of eggplant purple. He
also had a ballet dancer (a girl) tattoed on his right
ear. (So? He’s not the only one, you know.)

“Now, now,” he said, as he placed his moist,
clammy, ham-like hand on my shoulder. (His touch
was as cold as a sex-starved cobra—and you know
how cold they are.) “I want you to know that I am
your friend.” (Oh, he was a sneaky one alright.)
He went on to tell me that at one time he was a thief.
(It was just an amiable prevarication; he only says
that for social prestige and reference.) I licked his
hand gratefully and shouted, “Yipeee!” (You see,
I speak Texan fluently.)

I knew he was as false as a chorus girl’s eye-
lashes, probably as slippery as a water-melon seed
too, but I was ready for him as I sat there relaxed as
an unconscious drunk, curling my moustache with a
heated hairpin and smoking a Viceroy. (I’m a
thinking man.) He was squirming like a nervous

dowager who couldn’t find the rest room. He
pointed to a photograph atop his desk and said, “My
daughter, age 19; I call her Gillette because it was so
hard to razor—ha, ha, ha. Her mother calls her
‘Baby’ because she has only one tooth.” (A nice kid,
I thought, but will probably grow up to be an ax-
murderess.) “Well, Cousin,” he continued, “shall we
have some tea before we begin?”

Shortly after, however, he had to apologize, for
he was a little short on tea—so I had to smoke a reg-
ular cigarette. The doc took three drags and his eyes
turned patriotic; they were blue with red whites.

When his eyes returned from orbit, he began his
questions to me. “Now Chum,” he said, “why do you
hold your hand inside of your coat? Do you think
yowre Napoleon? Perhaps you have an itch?”

“Of course not,” I replied. (Actually, I took a
lie detector test later, and it proved I was lying.)
“My belt was taken from me, and ’m holding my
pants up.” I also told him that I liked sitting im
rocking chairs, but I don’t think that Pm Whistler’s
Mother. (1 did hear that she eventually went off her
rocker—rumors, rumors, teh, tch.)

At this juncture I asked for something to quench
my thirst. “Would you care for some champagne?’”*
he asked.

“Oh, yes!” I replied, “champagne always tastes
like my foot’s asleep.”

“Thirsty, eh?” he inquired, as he arched his eye-
brow over his good eye.

“No,” I answered, “not thirsty ; my teeth are on
fire and the smoke is getting in my eyes.”

The doe reached over and patted me on my head
in a friendly gesture—leaving two ugly red welts.
“Tt’s just a flesh wound,” I mumbled to a few disin-
terested passers-by.

As soon as I retained my vision he raised his
drink and said, “Well, here’s to the bats in your bel-
frey, as we psychiatrist say.”

“Cajon” Il @eec you sancl wnat aclmmuealoly,”

“Sir,” he said, mounting a small tree stump in
his office, ‘‘are you showing contempt for this of-
fice?”

“No, Sir, Pm trying to conceal it.”

He shot me a stare that was dirtier than the in-
side of a Russian horse doctor’s medicine kit. He
slowly drew out his pearl handled sword, quickly
brandished it three times over his head, called to one
of the coffee house raiders, who were squating near-
by like vultures, to fetch his bugle and blow
CHARGE. After this order had been complied with,
Doe pointed his sword directly at me and coura-
gcously charged. I instantly lit a Viceroy (thinking
man, remember!) 1 putied furiously very ture
ously—then avoided the charge under cover of the
smoke screen. (It’s possible, but only with Vice-

roys.)
“The champagne was purchased for 8¢ a fifth,
at an auction, after some real spirited bidding.
