ETER one hundred and fifteen years of con-
tant debate, a consensus seems to be evolv-
ng that the right and wrong test is outmoded
nd needs overhauling. In England, in the
~Report of the Royal Commission on Capital
4 Punishment submitted in 1953, eleven of the
twelve members of the Commission agreed that ‘‘the
test of responsibility laid down by the M’Naghten
Rule is so defective that the law on the subject
ought to be changed.’’ In the United States, all but
one member of the American Law Institute’s Criminal
Law Advisory Committee likewise agreed that the
M’Naghten formulation is inadequate.

Most psychiatrists have long been complaining of
this inadequacy. Their objection, to put it as briefly
as possible, is that the concept of knowledge of right
and wrong which the law relies upon is not a concept
that psychiatry uses in distinguishing mental dis-
order from mental health. They deny that incapacity
to know the nature and quality of an act or incapacity
to know its wrongfulness is the only significant symp-
tom of mental disorder and the only criterion of re-
sponsibility. This concentrating of attention on cog-
nition and ignoring volition and emotion is unscien-
tific. It is also unscientific to ignore the role played
by the unconscious—that submerged part of our
mind which so largely controls our basic attitudes
and our behavior. :

To modern psychology, reason, emotion and im-
pulse are not disparate functions, but interdependent
and interacting manifestations of the unitary person-
ality. The word ‘‘mind”’ today is taken as an abstract
term signifying the sum total of the ways in which
the individual acts in response to the internal and
external stimuli that are constantly playing upon
him. Not only are intellection, volition and emotion
inextricably interwoven manifestations of the single
personality, but it is probably emotion and not intel-
lection that is the most important of them. The law-
yer’s assumption that the one important mental fune-
tion is finding answers to questions is not supported
by the students of the mind.

It is because the legal test dates from 1843—a date
before psychiatry had given us these insights into the
workings of the human mind—and indeed a date be-
fore psychiatry as a science even existed—that the
legal definition ‘‘has little relation to the truths of
mental life,’’ as Mr. Justice Cardozo told us as long
azo as 1929.

Today, as already said, apparently even the legal
profession is becoming convinced that this is so and
that the M’Naghten Rule must be replaced with
one that better accords with the scientific facts. The
question is what rule should we put in its place.

In deciding what changes to make, we should bear
in mind the main defects of the old rule that we are
trying to remedy. We have said that the main defect
with the right and wrong test is that it does not ae-
cord with modern psychiatric thinking. The law
simply does not talk the same language as the psy-
chiatrist. In consequence, it is almost impossible for
the psychiatrist on the witness stand to say anything
that seems to him meaningful. On his basis of the
examination of the defendant, the doctor may be of
opinion that the defendant knew the physical nature
of his act, but that he had no real appreciation of its
enormity or its significance. If asked, and if he gave
a truthful answer, the accused would be able to say
that he knew the act was wrong. But he is seriously
psychotic; his disorder has materially affected his
personality, his viewpoint and his conduct; and the
psychiatrist is convinced that the act was attrib-
utable to the disorder. On the witness stand he is
not asked merely to explain this diagnosis and the
data on which it is based; we insist that he address
himself to an ethical question of wrongfulness instead
of testifying about the psychiatric realities that lie
within his field of competence.

The doctor knows that the crucial question upon
which the law focuses is not merely a medical one,
but is the ultimate one determining whether the ac-
cused is to be held guilty or not. He knows that if
he says the defendant knew that the act was wrong,
he is saying that he is legally sane and punishable,
although his own opinion may actually be that he
was seriously disordered and that the act was com-
mitted as a product of the disorder. If he answers
the ultimate question in the negative he is perhaps
more correctly expressing his honest judgment that
the defendant was not mentally responsible, but,
strictly, it would be an untrue answer. This, as the
Group for Advancement of Psychiatry has pointed
out, ‘‘leaves the witness with his intellectual honesty
at stake and no escape.”’

This is why so many psychiatrists condemn the
legal test and why so many of them refuse to serve
as expert witnesses. Their view has been well stated

by Dr. Robert Waelder :

‘‘Many psychiatrists seem to resent a situation in
which they are compelled to speak a language not
their own, which they either feel to be prescientific
or which they, rightly or wrongly, suspect to be
loaded with metaphysical implications not easily per-
ceived.
