Eastern Echo

During the past three or four decades there have been at least three or four
committees established to make a decision concerning the “‘Old Eastern Peniten-
tiary.” During the past three or four years two attempts have been made by
committees to again make a decision. As of this date nothing has been done. It

behooves us, then, to live with what we have. This in itself is a problem.

Space is ata premium. The only place to go is up. We must use makeshift
quarters for any new additions to our program. The cooperation of the inmate
population and the personnel is remarkable. We improvise, construct smaller
rooms out of small rooms, and generally emerge from the maze with a feeling of
gratitude for our maintenance department, their workers and their ingenuity.

The impossible has been done.

Maybe someday in the future we will look up and see the New State

Correctional Institution at Philadelphia.
