they couldn’t get unwound and looked good in
some games and terrible in others. This year strictly
an unknown quantity.

The final standings of the Pacific Coast Con-
ference should read something like this: Southern
California, University of California at Los Angeles,
University of Washington, Stanford, Oregon, Cali-
fornia, Oregon State, Washington State, and Idaho.

Due to the suspensions mentioned earlier,
Stanford will probably represent the PCC in the
Rose Bowl.

I hope that this information is what you wanted,
and does some good. In closing, may I congradu-
late you on your program which is in keeping with
your fine publication.

Very truly yours,
AGENDA, Sports Editor

Sports Editor:

I had the pleasure of receiving your nice
letter today when I reported for work. Needless to
say I was pleasantly surprised to hear from you.

Well, sir, I should like to herewith enter upon
the field of sports forecastings with the following
observations. In the Big Seven Conferences I see
Oklahoma carrying the banner again this year but
I predict that when the ‘‘Sooners’’ meet the ‘‘Irish’’
of Notre Dame the Irish will win. This game in
my opinion, will decide the number one team of
the nation. Following in order in the Big Seven I
see Missouri, Colorado, Nebraska, Kansas, Kansas
State and Iowa State.

In the Skyline Conference there seems to be
little doubt that Denver University will be the top
team. They should be given a lot of competition
by Wyoming and Utah.

May I congratulate you on your fine idea. I
think that this is a step forward for the Penal
Press and may I make a further suggestion. I
believe that this idea should be carried on on a
monthly poll basis and we could pick our own top
team of the nation in December.

Thanks again for the nice letter. Keep up
the good work.

FOOTBALL FOOLISHNESS

by
John DeBellis, Sports Editor, San Quentin News

Football. . the electrifying roar of 80,000
voices in unison. . .the icy fingers up and down your
Spine and the hairs on the nape of your neck
standing at attention when the band strikes up the
National Anthem. . .the distant scent of burning
leaves wafted to you on a pert autumn breeze. . .
panty raids. . .the season of foolishness.

This is what football season used to signify.
Out here on the western shores of America, football

EASTERN EcHo

season now means the cacophonic roar of 8,000,000
voices raised in protest. . .protesting injustices,
imagined or real, meted out by savants of the
Pacific Coast Conference. The rapt neanderthal
nape hairs are joined by eyebrows. . nay, even
sealps. The smell that assails your nostrils is com-
bustion sure enough. . .records and schedules and
prognostications going up in smoke. There’s no
time for such tomfoolery as panty raids.

The air is rife with fines, penalities, mass in-
eligibility rulings and Rose Bowl disqualifications. . .
investigations, counter investigations, self investi-
gations. . .accusations and counter accusations. . .
still the season of foolishness.

Ears are glued to radios, eyes to the sports page
for the latest of what doest the savants.

**Count that day lost
When the low descending sun
Does not bring some news
Of What the PCC has done.
In olden times
It was by Aesop a fable,
But now its who got what
And how low under the table.

**Plagiarized from ‘‘ Wilmots”’ in the San Francisco
Chronicle.

The lousy hams are monopolizing the scene.
They ought to give the ball players a break.

So. . .knowing not what additional foolishness
the educators might wreak, the PCC shapes up
like so. . .

1. Oregon State. . .Coach Tommy Prothro schooled
in the art of recruiting by U.C.L.A. mentor Red
Sanders, amassed a 6-2 conference record in his
freshman year. OS figures to improve on that
with the return of a sound veteran squad in a
war torn conference.

2. Stanford. . .The Indians have a great first team
but lack of depth will hold them down to second
place.

3. Washington. . .Were coming on and showed
signs of being a contender but their $52,000
fine upset future recruiting. Not deep enough
for a better berth than third.

4. California. . .Came out of embarassing slush
fund crisis smelling like a rose. Would normally
stack up seventh or eighth but...

5. Southern California. . Hard hit by ineligibility
fiat.

6. U.C.L.A. .. .Wiped out by ineligibility of star
studded senior rank.

7. Oregon. . .Nothing.
8. Washington State. . .Ditto.
9. Idaho. . .Perennial floor mats.

College of the Pacific would stack up a solid seventh
or better. With a powerful Dick Bass tallying
seores of touchdowns, COP is the top western in-
dependent. Bass’ high school feats are as well
known as Bill DeCorrevant’s. Bass pounded out a
13 yard average on the frosh squad last year.
