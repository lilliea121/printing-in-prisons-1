ohn lay in bed, dreamily awake, reflecting on

J his new life. It was strange. He had imagined

that marriage would automatically make him
into a new man. He must have expected some
metamorphosis to take place when he married.
Somehow he felt he should have different ideas,
different feelings and thoughts, but he didn’t.

It had been the same when he became twenty-
one. He had expected then, too, to automatically
feel different, to change from a boy to a man in one
simple action of turning twenty-one, but he had
found that he felt no different on his birthday than
he had the day before, or even the month before.

Today it was the same. He had been married
to Betty three days now, and although he had ex-
perienced new emotions, powerful emotions he had
not known before, he sadly discovered that he was
not appreciably changed. The dream was itself ev-
idence of that. Ever since he could remember, he
had had the dream. It was always the same. Always.

In the dream, a beautiful young woman of
about 20 stood by a rose-arbour in a garden. She
wore a rather severe, plain dark dress, and her
light wavy hair stood away from her tiny face as
though a light summer breeze wafted gently
through the garden. She stood with her face turned
toward him, her left hand raised in a gesture of
farewell, a look of infinite sadness in her eyes. The
dream was always the same. He wished he could
remember all of it, but he couldn’t. He could always
remember seeing her standing there, waving, but
beyond that he could not penetrate. He always
felt upon awakening that some part of the dream
had escaped him, had eluded him. He felt cheated,
somehow, and sad.

The first time he could remember dreaming of
her had been when he was seven, or perhaps eight.
He dreamt of her and had been strangely shaken,
erying out in his sleep, for the Sister at the orphan-

that he must have had a bad dream, that now every-
thing was all right. Ever since then, periodically,
he would have the dream, and it would never vary,
but was always the same. It had been the same last
night.

It was strange that Betty should resemble the
girl in the dream. She was oddly lke her, and yet
she was different. Betty’s hair was the same color,
and there was a slight resemblance in the facial
structure, but there the resemblance ceased. Betty
was tall, almost as tall as he was himself, and the
dream woman was tiny. Betty was big, well-built,
too, whereas the woman was childlike, almost frag-
ile.

He supposed Betty’s resemblance to the dream
woman was partly responsible for his attraction to
her, and it was possible, he reflected, that because
he had realized this he had rushed into this marriage
with a girl he hardly knew.
