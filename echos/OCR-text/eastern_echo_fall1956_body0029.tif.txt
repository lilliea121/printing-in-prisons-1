NOSTALGIA

(Continued from Page 7)

Carnal?

Could anyone duplicate the pure excitement of
that child’s joyous cry as you held him high above
the crowds to see and salute Rex and Court as his
Majesty passed by in all of the splendor of accumu-
lated Carnwals?

Was tt that little bar up the street that was fre-
quented by the Airline Personnel bragging of their
flights as you quietly sat and absorbed the rier
sounds humming in steadily over the music of the

juke-box?
Was it Shrove Tuesday you fervently prayed
would never end... and the mask and costume, true

subjects wore this day, would stay on and on — not

just till sundown, as the custom goes? But, then, being
a loyal subject of Rex, your mask did come off along
with the rest, promptly. And you cautiously fought
back the mist that suddenly clouded your vision.

Did you ever think that this particular moment—
Now—would seem so far away from the Sugar Bowl
Game on New Years Day? The game you missed
only because, well, 1 was New Years and the Officers
from that French Cruiser docked at the Wharf asked
a few questions about this city. The city that was
really yours now. How your head ached with the
hangover next morning, not helped either bu the
final score - your favorite team was defeated.

Didn’t he know this serenity would be shattered
someday if he stayed too long? Some April morning
it would end? . .. Why didn’t he look back as
they led him away?

question :

Albert D. Winkler, D-2283, forwarded to your Editor the following

While I am in favor of the new Treatment Program, I do feel that it could

be more effective if we inmates understood more fully the duties and place of
its Director in the institution setup. May I ask, then, what is the status and
purpose of the Director of Treatment and his office?

Answer:

The Director of Treatment coordinates the activ-
ities of the various services and specialties in the
institution which deal with the welfare of the inmate.
He functions under the supervision of the Warden
and is responsible to the Warden for the preparation
and carrying through of a program to aid the inmates
in their rehabilitative effort. He acts as a liaison
between Treatment Staff, custodial forces and the
Warden.

However, while the various treatment depart-
ments are coordinated by the Director, let me stress
the point that the Director does not make individual
decisions for each treatment department, since the
function of each department rests with its depart-
ment head. Rather, there is a chain of command
which operates in something of the following manner :

(a) The department heads are responsible for
their departments.

(b) They in turn are responsible to the Director
of Treatment, who in turn is responsible to the
Warden of the institution.

(ce) The Director formulates the general treat-
ment policy which must be reflected throughout
all the treatment departments. This treatment

policy can be felt by you not necessarily in the
form of any specific decision that I, or any of
the Staff, make regarding you, but rather in the
form of a changed prison climate, by which is
meant the recognition by the inmate that the
personnel of the institution are interested in
him as an individual and will listen to and act
upon his personal needs on that basis.

(d) In line with the Director’s policies, the
individual department heads make whatever spe-
cifie decisions as come under their areas of
specialty. So long as these decisions reflect a
treatment philosophy, the Director does not
play any further role. Nor does he seek to
place his personal judgment above that of the
specific department head involved. For instance,
the Director will ask for and receive a follow-up
medical cheek or even, when thought to be neces-
sary by the inmate, a review examination, but
never will he attempt to diagnose the ailment
or question the medical treatment prescribed
by the Medical Department. The Director feels
that a general treatment philosophy can only be
effective with the responsibility for each depart-
ment resting upon the department head.
