tors; usually when precedent is involved with accom-
panying publicity and prestige. Every day gross
miscarriages of justice occur in every level of criminal
law, due to faulty procedure. Yet, we hear no hue or
cry of protest from the celebrated advocates. But let
an ambiguity of procedure or due process enter into
a corporate legal matter and presto, in no time at all
millions of dollars’ worth of legal talent appears.
Criminal law, without a doubt, is the black sheep of
the legal family! Humanity once again is upstaged
by big business.

The intent of a profession, as we understand it, is
to serve the public, and the lawyer, being a profes-
sional man, is not engaged in the practice of law
purely from the monetary aspect. Therefore, the truly
professional lawyer has the concern of the com-
munity, the maintenance of law and order and the
administration of justice as his foremost concern.
Profit is of secondary importance. The public con-
fidence is strengthened and the lawyer becomes the
public ally, its friend and protector. Integrity is estab-
lished and the leadership and responsibility of the
lawyer becomes a reality.

If this assumption is correct, what, one may un-
kindly inquire, is the reason why so many people
people entering a lawyer's office immediately begin
to figure out ways to protect themselves from, of all
people, the lawyer? Because they feel that they are
one great big lollypop for the lawyer’s sweet tooth?
Let our advocates answer that one! Better yet, let
them poll the public and see if they harbor this feel-
ing. What the Bar Associations do not answer very
successfully is the charge that they are commercial-
izers who manipulate the people of the U.S. like so
many puppets, trying to intensify their fast-slipping,
lily-white image as dedicated humanitarians. More
political power and prestige is sought by legal op-
portunists, for the cold cash involved in the tune of
“God Bless America,” than legal apologists care to
think about. Their professional image is the fault of
the lawyers themselves, many of whom haven't been
inside a criminal court since they went as student
observers. If law is a trade let’s call it one. There are
plenty of respectable trades. There is nothing shame-
ful in being called a tradesman. Is there? Further-
more, the only thing some lawyers sell is their person-
ality, not legal ability. By inundating their clients in a
flood of charm and compliments they take for
granted the legal ignorance prevalent in the layman
and use this ignorance to intensify their image as the
sly, clever, tricky servant of humanity they endeavor
to convey of themselves. If the practice of law is to
be treated as just another commercial venture then
let the lawyer say so. He should not be allowed to

have his cake and also eat it, as all too many of them
do. The lawyer seems to expect respect from the
community because of his profession. We submit it
would be forthcoming automatically if he would but
devote a portion of his time and knowledge to the
betterment of his community by applying his experi-
ence to the protection of the people who are forced to
fight long, lonely battles in forma pauperis against
impossible odds.

The typical answer of the legal profession to these
charges are, “We have many agencies such as the
Legal Aid Society and the American Civil Liberties
Union to see that these abuses do not occur.’ True,
but the job is far greater than these organizations can
hope to handle properly. They barely scratch the
surface. There is hardly a court in the land where
procedure doesn’t vary from defendant to defendant,
at the expense of true justice, the justice we have so
proudly set forth on paper! To correct this is the re-
sponsibility of every citizen, and of the legal profes-
sion in particular! The attitude of the legal profession
is that it recognized these unjust possibilities and,
through the efforts of the societies sponsored by it,
eventually hopes to rectify these problems—but the
wheels of justice grind slowly, so be patient. This is
hard for those directly affected by unjust practice to
digest, and a black eye to the legal profession.

It is unthinkable to imagine a doctor having a
man’s life in his hands without the benefit of prior
instruction from experienced physicians under actual
conditions who gave freely of their time to prepare
the newly graduated doctor for the practice of his
profession after he has left school. The young doctor
is constantly under watchful supervision until he has
proved by experience in the community that he is
capable of pursuing his work on his own. But quite
often a young lawyer fresh out of law school, with no
actual courtroom experience, pleads a case where a
considerable portion of a man’s life is at stake (prison
has sometimes been compared to a living death and it
matters not to the individual whose hands he is in, his
life, or free life, is still in jeopardy). Life is cheap in
business of law as it is practiced today, contrary to all
the high-sounding platitudes.

The legal profession has no over-all program
whereby experienced lawyers impart the benefit of
their knowledge to young lawyers just beginnng to
practice criminal law. There should be such a pro-—
gram in every state in the nation. The man in Calif-
ornia is just as interested in justice as the man in
Florida. At the very least, law students should be
required to spend some time in a semi-official capac-
ity such as observers in the court, attending actual
trials, hearings, arraignments, sentencings. His re-
