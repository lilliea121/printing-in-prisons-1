bilitation of criminal offenders. Such a combined
program would, of course, be most meaningful and
helpful to prisoners who are sentenced to long terms
of imprisonment.

It has been long recognized by penologists that
in order to gain real assurance that criminal offend-
ers will take peaceful and law-abiding places in
society upon their release from prison, a sound pro-
eram of rehabilitation and instruction must be
afforded them while they are confined. The vast
majority of prisoners would probably agree that the
most important thing which they could learn while
confined is a trade or vocation so as to enable them to
compete for Jobs and earn an honest living when re-
leased. ** This should be incorporated as an im-
portant factor in a combined program of rehabilita-
tion, commutation and parole of prison inmates and
prison sentences. In order to achieve such a pro-
gram, society must recognize its responsibility in this
field. Certainly the social advantages to be gained
by such a program are many. In my opinion it would
serve to renew the faith and respect of our citizenry
in our system of laws which undoubtedly are se-
riously wavering today in light of the continued in-
crease in crime rate which we have experienced over
the years.

In addition to instruction in trades and vocations,
specialized lecture, film and discussion programs
should be increased in our prisons. Courses of in-
struction should be regularly scheduled in whatever
subjects are necessary and helpful to increase the
understanding and ability of prisoners to rejoin
society without confusion, frustration and conflict.
Professional, business and educational institutions
and associations could be called upon to sponsor and
supply instructors for such a program. Public funds
should be made available for the compensation of
such instructors.

A citizen’s committee should be appointed to
study the basic areas of instruction and consultation
necessary in order for an individual to reasonably
understand society and himself and to adapt himself
to society in a useful and law-abiding manner. Such
a study would be the basis of a standard of instrue-
tion to be incorporated into prison life. Achieve-
ment in the program, in accordance with the ability
of the prisoner, together with conduct ratings could
be taken into account and weighed towards the com-
mutation of the prisoner’s sentence. If practical, I
believe that at least two hours daily should be de-
voted to trade and vocation training. In this way,
prisoners could earn commutation of minimum
sentences in accordance with their performance in
the program and their conduct while imprisoned.
Finally, and in conjunction with such a commutation
program, psychiatric interviews should be given
every prisoner in order to judge his emotional stabil-
ity and degree of rehabilitation prior to his release
on parole.

It is my opinion that a concerted effort must be
made in this field in order that we re-evaluate and
meet our responsibility to the criminal offender and
in order to protect our system of order under law.
We have recognized the process of rehabilitation
through supervision after release from prison in our
present parole system. The parole system is itself a
system of conditional commutation in that prisoners
are released for the remainder of their terms and are
not recommitted to institutions unless they violate
the terms of parole. If this system were supported
by a strong rehabilitation program during the con-
finement period, I am certain that the gain to society
would be great and violation of parole would be re-
duced to an unbelievable minimum. The earning
of commutation by prisoners would serve as the im-

portant incentive and morale factor in such a pro-
gram.
