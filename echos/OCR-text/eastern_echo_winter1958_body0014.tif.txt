A complex personality . . . composed of many

This is the portrait of a friend. My friend, and
the friend of all who come under the eare of his

. strong but gentle hands. The blustery ‘“Nightin-
gale” with “Bull” voice and tender heart, Earl Bro-
gan.

Like all mankind, Earl is composed of many
emotions. He is a complex personality. However,
in the diversion from one Earl Brogan to another,
he never loses that driving spirit that is such a nec-
essary part of man. When the touch of an autumn
breeze brings zest to all football enthusiasts, Earl
may be seen, savagely smashing out of the fullback

to opposing linemen, was a member of the toughest

team in the world. As a paratrooper, it is easy to
imagine Earl tumbling from a troop-carrier with
an ear-Shattering scream of “Geronimo!”

This is the Earl Brogan on the battlefield and
playing field. The indomitable catcher behind the
plate; the powerhouse fullback; the deadly fighter
for freedom. :

of the Karl Brogan above, lies the softer, shaded
picture with a background painted in the soothing
tones of mercy. And yet, as a veritable angel of

: mercy, Earl cajoles, soothes, gentles, and adminis-
by HENRY MYERS ters to the pain-wracked bodies that lie in our Hos-
pital Ward. His tireless lending of strength, as men
lie in the dark hours staving off the grim spectre
of death, has helped many a man to open his eyes
on the glory of a new day on Earth. To Earl, it is
not his duty to serve others. It is his desire and
empathy toward all mankind.

His understanding of the perversity men show

while suffering, can best be illustrated by a recent
