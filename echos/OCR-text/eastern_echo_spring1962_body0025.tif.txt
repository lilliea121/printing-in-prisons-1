Ella Fitzgerald: At the risk of alienating the
world, I have to admit I get a little more tired with
her every day.

Frank Sinatra: Ditto!

Ornette Coleman: I’ve been told that the reason
I don’t get the message is because he’s playing in
code.

Fabian: A living example of a “Sick Joke.”

Stereo Records: You pay a dollar more to stand
in the middle of the room.

Flip Phillips: What ever happened to him?

=i)

Bongo Drums: Almost as popular as Monopoly.

Joe Newman:..This guy has more good taste than
Emily Post ever had.

Count Basie Orchestra: The living definition of a
type of togetherness undreamed of by the Ladies
Home Journal.

Stan Getz—Pardon me while I go light the candles.

Leo Tillman: During the summer, I had the un-
usual opportunity of sharing a gig with Leo and his
American Artist trumpet. First of all, in a marvelous
display of Gamemanship, Leo put on a large pair of
sunglasses to play the session. This in itself, seeing
Leo Tillman with his American Artist trumpet stick-
ing in front of his face while wearing a large pair of
sunglasses, is enough to shake anybody up. To further
this bit of sabotage, he paid the guitar player six
packs of cigarettes to change the keys on me every
six bars; when he borrowed a tenor for me to play,
he made sure the G-sharp key stuck; when I needed

Eastern Echo

a better reed, he borrowed a No. 34 (he knows I use
a 24); he refused to play anything but. blues in B-
flat; he snapped his fingers on 1 and 3 and every
chance he’d get, he’d whisper in my ear things like,
“Is that Wheeler coming over with his horn?” or
ONO, alo, wna s 2 1Bammoe Tin” oe “Lasi, claorus,
man—the drummer’s getting tired” It went like this
all afternoon. When Leo suggested we play only
tunes that he’s been practicing and then refused to
play S’ Wonderful, I quit. Anyway, I can’t stand
eats influenced by Les Elgart.

Overheard in the bandroom;

A. “Man, I’m telling you—Bird didn’t play any
better than you do. It’s all in the publicity!”

B. “Let’s get out of this hole, Bernie, these guys
are a buncha nuts.”

C. “But I thought we had the room today!”

D. “Look, Officer, I told you before, the last time
IT saw him he was heading for the window on 3 block.”

E. “Do all Drummers take dope?”

EF. “No, schnnok! Dave Brubeck’s a trumpet
player !”

G. “Id like to get that Adams by the throat... .”

H. “Man, it was a gas! As I left her pad, I told
her I played bari in Maynard’s band!”

I. “Well, man, we might go off our nut now and

then, but at least we’ve got a stable outlook toward
life, you dig?”

J. ‘Listen Dad, he said to go ahead and play. He’d
make it right after psycho-therapy class was over.”

Kk. “Believe me, this stud is a real cube, but I gotta
play with somebody.”

L. “Man, I don’t care how long he’s been playing
that horn. I ean blow my nose better than that.”

Look at it this way . . . I mean, what’d you expect
for 25¢. A biography of Leo Tillman? Let’s put it
where it’s at—I’m tired, I sent the piece in late, I had
a bad day in the bandroom, and anyway, I heard
Leo’s been punching out cats lately.
