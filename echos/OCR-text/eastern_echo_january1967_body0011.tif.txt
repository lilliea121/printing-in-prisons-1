The right to dissent should be vigorously protect-
ed by the government. It is difficult to be forthright
and persuasive when fear of reprisals are evident in
justifiable complaints being misinterpreted as out-
right rebellion. The courage to dissent and protest
becomes more acute in the face of adversity. Es-
pecially when the dissenters’ patriotism is chal-
lenged by public officials seeking to silence the mass
by labeling their actions as un-American and com-
munistic.

Much blood, sweat and tears are written in Ameri-
can history because of the stubborness of govern-
ment to acknowledge that this country was founded
on the premise of a government of the people, by the
people, and for the people. That no person shall
abrogate powers unto himself possessive of the idea
that he is a law unto himself.

These laws are based on the theory that when any-
one becomes inclined to challenge the basic rights of
American citizens as written in our books of law,
then it is time to challenge him. Since government
and law are products of mortal man, they need con-
stant challenge and review so that they may serve
not merely a few but the many.

The quality of dissent defines its merits. While
dissent and protest presupposes a manner of non-
conformance, it does not lie in hatred and violence.
This is an abuse of dissent. Dissent and protest
should be aimed at clearly defined targets and in the
clear interest of the whole community. Meritorious
dissent does not have as its goal the inflaming of vio-
lent actions and the igniting of propaganda for those
who seek, literally, to overthrow our government.
Dissent is constructive not destructive.

This basic right to dissent is a form of strengthen-
ing government. Errors are part of the thinking and
behavior of man. It is a distinguishing factor that
makes man improve by ccrrection. However, this
process cannot be perfected if man is unaware of the
error or errors made. By pointing them out to him,
this should make him re-evaluate his position and
thinking and give him a clearer perspective of the
error and the method of correction. This is not al-
ways the case as explained earlier. Too often, the
dissenters are met with a type of reverse dissent.
Sometimes, it is not easily disclaimed because of the
inherent faith and trust Americans hold for their
elected officials. Thus, they are casily duped into
closing their minds to the dissenting view.

One of the main objections to dissent and protest
(particulary in the United States at present) seems
to be a fear of disrespect for the law and the stirring
of passions better left dormant. People seem to feel
that peace exists where quiet resides. Classes may

absorb abuse and injustice for a time; inevitably,
they rise up in protest. The rumblings of discontent
are of a parody when not stimulated by actions. The
affluent of society must be prodded out of its com-
placency. It has been a bitter reality of the grim
lesson of nations that catered to a few while disre-
garding millions of people who made up the bulk of
their population.

ARISTOTLE TO ADOLPH TO LBJ

In Mein Kampf Adolph Hitler has shown how he
gains acceptance (pistols and brass knuckles help-
ed, too). Guided by his dominant purpose—to
get his notions across—he urges these simple
rules: (1) Arguments must be directed to the
“Jeast intelligent” of the people; (2) avoid “‘sci-
entific ballast’’ as much as possible; (8) give the
simple points ‘‘thousandfold repitition;’’ (4)
seek ever to hold the attention of the great mas-
ses; (5) seek not ‘‘the many-sidedness of sci-
entific teaching;’’ (6) restate the main few
points as slogans; (7) never try to become ver-
satile, altering the methods, for the masses will
not retain the idea; (8) never permit the faint-
est suggestion that there is ‘‘right on the other
side; (9) no halfway urgings will do; things are
either ‘‘positive or negative, love or hate, right
or wrong, the truth or lie;’’ and (10) regardless
of all else, keep focused on the fundamental prin-
ciple, limit the program, and repeat it eternally.

Dissent and protest has not been a failure. De-
spite the many objections remedial ways of correc-
tion has been instituted. On the state level there has
been the erection of special grievance boards set up
to hear dissenting views or complaints from citizens.
This is a beginning but not nearly enough. Many of
these boards are in use on the governmental level.
However, the drawbacks are many. There seems to
be a reluctance on the part of government officials to
recognize the average citizen. These public officials
seem to think, one of their counterparts can speak
for “the man in the street.” They couldn’t be further
from the truth. In order to understand any problem
with clarity the individual must either be a part of
the problem or to have empathy for the problem.
This seems to be a difficult process and the difficulty
is very clear.

Man wants to feel secure against intrusion of his
public position. However, extremity in this may lead
