Parole is the release of a convicted offender
under supervision, and under certain restrictions
and requirements, after he has served a portion of
his sentence in a penal institution. It is not clemency
or a grant of forgiveness, but a process of regulated
reformation. Prison gates swing two ways—they
swing shut for those who have run afoul of the law
and are sentenced to a period of confinement, and
they swing open for those who have served the por-
tion of their sentence deemed necessary for prepara-
tion to return to free society. Ninety-five percent of
the persons sent to prison are eventually returned
to society, about 40 percent on parole and a consider-
able number of the remainder under some form of
supervision. So it is vitally important that the
bridge of supervision, which must carry them from
a controlled situation to freedom and useful citizen-
ship, be a strong one.

Although parole received its first official sanc-
tion in the United States over 80 years ago when
the Elmira Reformatory in New York began the
practice, it has been viewed with much suspicion
and distrust by a large segment of the general pub-
lic. Statements of certain public officials, columns
of adverse newspaper editorials and persons in pri-
vate life who have a personal fear of parole as a tool
of rehabilitation, help to fan the flames of contro-
versy.

and particularly in Parole since that time. But there
is, of course, much more to be done. People every-
where should acquire a better understanding of at
least some of the things they should know concern-
ing the objectives, the accomplishments, and the
shortcomings of parole. It is only through such
understanding that we can hope to make progress.

I speak to you—our readers—not as an expert
on the subject, but as one who has been around pa-
role for a sufficient length of time to appreciate its
place in modern penology, to have an abiding ad-
miration for those who devote their lives to the
cause, and to be aware of some of its many problems.

It has been my opportunity to see much of pa-
role from different vantage points; first, of course,
as a citizen; second, as a parolee; third, as a parole
violator; fourth, as the Editor of a Penal Publica-

ferent picture from each of these vantage points be-
cause from each of them the outlook is circum-
seribed. But, each of these experiences has strength-
ened my belief in the importance of the work and
my expectation for its accelerated progress in the
future.

PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE

In many quarters, the principle of parole is
little understood and reluctantly accepted. In so
