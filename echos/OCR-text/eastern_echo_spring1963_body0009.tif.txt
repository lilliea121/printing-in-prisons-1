Hooked on

The tragedy and scandal of drug addiction in the
United States is obscured by confusion and ignor-
ance, by conflicting and strongly held opinions on
what it is and how to cope with it.

At one end of the spectrum is the law enforce-
ment view which operates on the premise that the
sale of heroin is illegal; therefore, whoever buys and
uses it is guilty of a criminal conspiracy. And be-
cause of the variety of crimes committed by addicts
to support their habits, law enforcement officials
tend to see addicts as criminals who must be pun-
ished. While the enforcement view is represented in
the main by the Federal Bureau of Narcotics under
national law, the violations are punishable on the
local level by every state in varying degrees.

For instance, in New York there must be proof
of external possession of narcotics, with penalties
ranging (according to the amount seized) from six
months to 15 years. In other states like New Jersey,
Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, what is called “‘in-
ternal possession’ (under narcosis) is sufficient for
arrest and conviction, with penalties ranging from
5 to 40 years. It is interesting to note, however, that
last year the U. S. Supreme Court voided a California
law which declared it a crime simply to be a drug ad-
dict, without regard for cause of addiction or proof
of irregular behavior. Under such a law, men who
have been wounded in war and had become addicted
to drugs while being treated in government hospitals,
would have been liable for prosecution when they
left the hospitals.

Tough laws and tough law enforcement have little
or no effect in clearing up the drug menace. Be-
leaguered officials periodically put on a show of law
enforcement in larger cities by resorting to multiple,
synchronized raids in various neighborhoods where
it is notoriously easy to buy heroin, or “‘horse’’ as it
is called. Invariably, only small-time addicts and
pushers are rounded up. Wealthy and non-addicted

racketeers who control the illegal drug traffic, sel-
dom, if ever, see the inside of a prison as the result
of such police sorties.

Law enforcement officials operate under the Har-
rison Act of 1914 which, theoretically, only regu-
lates the manufacture, import, and distribution of
narcotics in the United States. In practice the law
has become a criminal and prohibitory rather than
regulatory statute. This interpretation of the law has
had the effect of putting addicts under the jurisdic-
tion of police rather than doctors, who have been
loath to treat addicts for fear of getting into trouble
with the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Over the
years, doctors have also become afraid of addicts be-
cause they have been held up for drugs. In the
course of some such robberies, those acting in op-
position to the criminal aggression, have been either
brutally beaten or even murdered. The concomitant
result, of course, has been to blur the medical aspects
of addiction and to highlight the crimes committed
to pay for it.

Another, but still legalistic, view of drug addic-
tion is that it should be “‘legalized’”’ to take the tre-
mendous profit out of the unlawful sale of heroin
and other narcotics. The British system of treating
addicts is pointed to as a sensible and human ap-
proach to the problem. However, addiction is not
legalized in England to the extent that anyone may
buy heroin in a drug store. Instead, an addict is
treated by one doctor who makes every effort to
wean him from his drug habit. Only if that fails are
drugs regularly supplied to him, and there are strict
regulations and precautions on all drug prescriptions.
In a population of some 50 million, there are only
about 400 known addicts in England. (Pep pill or
“‘soof ball’? users are not considered drug addicts,
per se, and therefore not included in this report.)
Critics of the British system say it would be impracti-
cal, except in small experimental groups, in a coun-
try the size of the United States with its larger, more
heterogenous and mobile population and its acquisi-
tive culture which might encourage unscrupulous
doctors, especially those of limited talents, to make
