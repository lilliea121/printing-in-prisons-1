Ist. Officer: . . . Look, Anton, that hard boiled stuff went out with the twentieth century.

2nd. Officer: . . .Yeah, you come clean, admit your crime and free yourself of guilt complexes, you don’t
want to be a schizo do you?

Ist. Officer: . . . We can speak to the Justice for you, get you a break.
2nd. Officer: . . .We’ll report that you were very cooperative, that will go a long way.
ENON o o o Gentlemen, you aren't suggesting that I violate my Constitutional Rights?

Both Officers: . . No! Oh, No! Nothing like that.

At this moment the inter-com summons Anton Mobisc into the Hall of Justice. It is not a very pretentious
room. Hardly larger than the anteroom. ‘There is one difference; six rather odd looking chairs, arranged
in a semi-circle facing a screen; on either side of the screen are oblong cabinets resembling computers. The
custodial officers seat themselves on either side of Anton who has chosen a seat second from left:

A strange metallic Voice:... Welcome to the Hall of Justice. Please be at ease. You will find both
Venusian and Martian Cigrons in the humidor at your chair. .

S. M. Voice: . . .You, gentlemen, have a problem; you seek adjustment; I am at your service.

S. M. Voice: . . .Please proceed.

S. M. Voice: . . .Would you care to disclose your source of information?

Both Officers: . . No.

S. M. Voice: . . .Of course you obtained the necessary grant before apprehending the suspect?

Ist. Officer: . . . No we didn’t. There was no time.

2nd. Officer: . . .Yeah! We would have lost him. Our tip... er...source told us to get out there right
away, didn't she Frank?

A\mt@OME oc o She! She? You mean...

S. M. Voice: . . .Of course you, gentlemen, realize that without the proper grant all proceedings so far, are
negligible.

/N\int@IM2 2 0 6 (Dazed) Ooh what’s the use?

S. M. Voice: . . .Anton, you realize that you don't have to say anything, but | must warn you that your
