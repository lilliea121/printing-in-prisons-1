An Introduction to Commutation

The Board of Pardons derives its authority direct-
ly from the set of fundamental principles by which
this Commonwealth is governed. Section 9 of Arti-
cle IV of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874 pro-
vides as follows:

‘(He (the Governor) shall have power to remit fines
and forfeitures, to grant reprieves, commutations of sen-
tence and pardons, except in cases of impeachment;
but no pardon shall be granted, nor sentence commuted,
except upon recommendation in writing of the Lieu-
tenant Governor, Secretary of the Commonwealth, At-
torney General, and Secretary of Internal Affairs, or
any three of them, after full hearing, upon due public
notice and in open session, and such recommendation,
with the reasons therefor at length, shall be recorded
and filed in the office of the Secretary of the Common-
wealth.”

In general, the Board hears and makes recommen-
dations on applications of the following categories:
(1) petition for commutation of a death penalty to
life imprisonment; (2) petition for commutation of
minimum sentence to make the applicant eligible for
release after parole by the Board of Parole; (3) peti-
tion for commutation of a life sentence to make the
applicant eligible for parole by the Board of Parole;
(4) petition for commutation of maximum sentence
of applicants on parole at the present time; (5) peti-
tions for complete pardons by applicants not now
serving any sentence for purposes of clearing their

records.

The Board of Pardons very rarely actually re-
leases a man from prison. Favorable action on their
part only makes an inmate eligible for the further
action of the Board of Parole. The two boards are
completely separate administrative bodies having
vastly differing functions. This is an important dis-
tinction which is often unrecognized.

The Governor cannot grant pardons or commute
sentences without first receiving a favorable recom-
mendation from the Board of Pardons, but he is not
bound by their favorable recommendation, and may
reject the same and refuse to grant clemency to the
applicant. However, the Governor cannot grant
clemency in any case where the Board of Pardons
has made an unfavorable recommendation. In those
casés involving court sentences of less than two
years, the sentencing judge has the right to parole
the applicant on his own authority.

Although the commutation of capital cases draws
the most publicity because of the usually high public

interest, such action is comparatively rare when com-
pared to the more common “commutation of mini-
mum sentence.’ The use of a hypothetical situation
permits the most graphic method of explaining the
procedures involved in such commutation.

Let us say that John Doe was convicted of the
charge of Armed Robbery in 1954, and sentenced to
serve ten to twenty years in the state penitentiary.
This means that his minimum sentence is ten years,
and at the expiration of that time he will be eligible
to appear in front of the Parcle Board. Through
their action he may be released to serve the remain-
der of his twenty years on parole. This procedure
has no connection with the workings of the Board of
Pardons.

Since we are dealing with a hypothetical case, let
us give John Doe the benefit of a hypothetical part-
ner, Paul Jones. Paul Jones was tried under a differ-
ent judge, and after being found guilty of the charge
was sentenced to five to ten years. [The two sentences
were perhaps inequitable, but many instances of such
variance in sentencing procedure may be found in
the records of our courts.

This being 1960, Paul Jones was released on pa-
role upon the action of the Parole Board after serv-
ing his minimum of five years. John Doe, found
guilty of the same crime, still faces five years of im-
prisonment before becoming eligible for parole ac-
tion. Having during his previous years of confine-
ment taken advantage of all avenues open to him in-
sofar as rehabilitative efforts are concerned, and
feeling confident that he deserves some further con-
sideration in view of the individual facts of his case,
John Doe files for commutation of his ten year mini-
mum so that he may, like his partner, apply for pa-
role.

To do this he obtains from the Secretary of the
Board of Pardons a set of ten copies of the pre-
scribed form which he must use for his application.
A fee of two dollars must be paid for these forms.
His application is then filed with the Board with a
payment of a fifteen dollar filing fee which is not
refundable.

A copy of his application will be sent by the Board
of Pardons to the court and to the District Attorney
of the county from which the applicant was sen-
tenced; to the correctional institution in which the

applicant was or is confined in order to obtain ex-
