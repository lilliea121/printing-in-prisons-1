has only gone to be replaced by the cool, ‘‘humane”’
impersonality of statistical psychology and sociology.
Which opinion furthers my belief that the individual
has no better chance of finding himself and a new
life under the new system than he had under the old.

TO WHAT PURPOSE

Today, upon reception, a man’s emotions, re-
actions, IQ, physical defects, education, etc., are all
nicely and professionally tested, charted, and duly
recorded. To what purpose, if no further use is
made of these catalogued profiles?

Yes, he is told—if he is illiterate—that schooling
is available. However, it is not compulsory,, and if
a man has remained illiterate during the greater part
of his life, surely he lacks the will power or desire
necessary to voluntarily start his education at this
late date. Let us say he does go to school—does this
make him a better citizen, or merely a literate
criminal? How does it affect the problem of
recidivism ?

Yes, the man is given an opportunity to learn a
trade. However, he probably came into prison with
the ability to earn an honest living. Only in few
instances does a man turn to crime because of his
inability to obtain employment. So he learns a
trade—does this make him a better citizen, or merely
a criminal with a trade? How does this affect the
problem of recidivism ?

A FEW MORE YES'S

Yes, the man is informed that psychological
counseling is available if he has an emotional
problem. However, in most cases the inmate is
unable to recognize the fact that he is in need of
such counseling, and will reject the offer without
further thought. Perhaps, he does attend a series
of individual or group therapy sessions, but how
many persevere. until they have reached a stage
where the patient can truthfully say, ‘‘I am a new
man.’’ Through disinterest, pressures of other

activities, parole, or completion of their sentence,
the majority of the participants leave the program
with no more insight or solution to their problems
than they had upon entering the prison. How does
this affect the problem of recidivism?

Yes, the man is interviewed by a classification
board and assigned to the institution thought most
fitting in his case. However, does this help under
the present system? Is the air of one more puri-
fying than the air of another? How does this affect
the problem of recidivism?

Yes, the man is permitted to read books, buy
commissary, go to movies, watch TV, and participate
in sports, but tell me, how does this affect the
problem of recidivism?

EXPLANATION WANTED.

Again, I repeat that I am thankful for the above
benefits and personal comforts which are possible
only under the administration of a ‘‘progressive’”’
system of penology. However, I would like to have
someone explain to me, how any of these benefits are
going to help any inmate solve his major problem—
the problem of emotional and mental readjustment
with its consequent personal and social reorgani-
zation.

SUCCESS. BUT BRST.

I do believe that ‘‘progressive’’ penology can
succeed where other systems have failed, but it must
first rediscover its seemingly lost purpose—to keep
men from returning to crime and prison. It must
return strongly to individual ‘‘human’’ treatment,
rather than the socially ‘‘humane’’ treatment it
sponsors at the present time.

Let the various tests, interviews, classifications,
ete., attain a standard of reference other than an
entry on the record; let them be used as a guide for
further treatment rather than the final result of
treatment, then ‘‘progressive’’ penology will be
striding into the future and will escape the ever
present danger of stagnation.

‘What is the intelligent, constructive, sensible thing to do with offenders? ...
‘In the long run prisoners know more about this than anyone else, and ought to come up with

the best ideas...

““So I come back to the point that progressive ideas about the control of social offenses and
the wisest handling of offenders for their good and society’s protection are likely to spring from
the constructive thinking of some who have had personal, bitter experience, and who are able to
rise above that experience and devote themselves to the solution of a problem which baffles us all,
and the solving of which will be a magnificent life expression for some of those who have suffered.’’
