THE NIGHT

The most difficult part of my day comes with the evening,
it is then that I feel the surging tides of loneliness
swelling out engulfing the world that is mine alone to
settle about me,

For the night...

Dusk brings the emptiness . . . or its beginning, for the
intense chill that enhances this nothingness that is
mine alone,

Comes with the night...

Upon my pillow I lay thinking of the morrow, for with dawn comes

the sun, casting her rays of radiant warmth that thaw
quickly the chill of past hours,
The chill of the night...

With the light comes hope and promise of moments of laughter,

a smile and a friendly voice; all savored with the
fragrance of fullness. It is only these that can break
the spell of emptiness,

Emptiness that comes with the night...

Compare not the light with the night!
The contrast is striking to a point appalling.
Nothingness is her companion. Nothingness and
the ring of lamenting love echoing against the
empty loneliness of my hollow heart,
Seeking escape from the night...

I dream parties, lots of parties, just peopleparties,
for those, like I, who suffer, the night comes but
to greet one another until the dawn,
I feel the gaiety as we walk casually with festive air,
but this too brings its remorse. It is not difficult to
see, even in my dream that we who are talking so freely,
and smiling too often and laughing too loud are but
fighting the loneliness,
Loneliness that comes with the night...

With supplication I pray to awake to a new world. A world
filled with people from every way of life,
people who are individual in their thinking,
broad in intelligence,
apprehensive people with love in their lives
People to shatter the night...

I pray to find a person who I can share all the joy...
for there must be beauty in this world!
A person to whom I can give the love of my heart,
a lamenting love now, that resounds within the
empty loneliness of my hollow heart,
Waiting for relief of the night...

Xmas Show
by S. R. Cantoral

The Inmates’ Christmas Show was
acclaimed to be the greatest ever pro-
duced at Eastern. It included the best
talent available—twenty exciting
performances. Singers, Jazz, Rock ‘n’
Roll and Eastern’s big band con-
ducted by Mr. Robert Barclay.

The band opened the show with a
striking arrangement of ‘White
Christmas.”’

Then came The Lonely Inmates, a
vocal group, singing ‘“‘Zing Went the
Strings of My Heart.” ‘Fingers,’ the
lead in this fine group, also played
the Auto-Harp.

The next act was Carl Beaver,
playing ‘‘Tea for Two” on the piano,
backed up by Bill. Schoonmaker on
drums, John Lujack on bass.

Lee Wiggins held the entire audi-
ence spellbound with his rendition of
“If I Loved You.” ‘Fingers,’ this
time on guitar, did a nice job of
backing him up.

Dick Gildea was next with a trum-
pet solo of ‘‘Wonderland by Night,’’
backed up by the band. Hats off to
Dick Gildea, he handled this tune
beautifully.

I knew this was going to be a
successful production. I was a little
surprised and very happy that the
show was successful in reaching the
hearts of the audience.

Bill (Mr. Blues) Henderson came
next singing ‘“‘Bye Bye Blackbird.’’
His casualness and microphone per-
sonality plus his ease of delivery
made it obvious that he had seen a
microphone before. Bill was coolly
assisted by Benny (Soul) Mincey on
tenor sax, Roosevelt (Bulge) Minter,
trumpet, Andrew (Sonny) Lopes,
guitar, John (Strut) Klauzenberg,
bass and Bill (Good Drivin’) Good-
man, skins. The performance was re-
ceived with deafening applause and
hoots, whistles and hollering for
more. Magnificent—vibrant, they
were.

Thomas (Big Six) Connors, with
his tenor sax, did a beautifully teas-
ing rendition of ‘“‘Wee Small Hours
of the Morning.’ The applause rung
to the rafters of this old chapel-audi-
torium. This marked one of the high-
lights in the program.

The next act, a favorite of many,
were the Ordells, singing ‘“‘Shop A-
