Following his star—amid the confusion
and separation of imprisonment—
with an eye to the future.

he trial was held January 27, 1954. Although there

were the charges of Armed Robbery against
the young defendant, Judge Maurice W. Sporkin of
Philadelphia Common Pleas Court No. 2, seated very
low in his chair to one side of the Bench, must have
appraised the whole affair as a more or less routine
matter. After all, the law had repeatedly been
broken by one Alphonso Jenkins. And after all, the
defendant was pleading eguilty—a decision which
ordinarily divests a criminal court proceeding of
much of its intriguing contest of subtle minds, legal
maneuvering and human drama. Apparently, all
that remained was to conduct a proceeding which
had already been historically structured in form and
content, and at the close to impost a fitting sentence.

This not being a jury trial, the six men and six
women members of that body had been dismissed to
sit among the spectators in Room 453. It was as if
attention were merely to be diverted for a time from
the far more involved cases to follow, where denials
of respective charges promised all the genuine inter-
est and suspense.

Yet as this ‘“‘routine’’ trial commenced, the at-
tention of the small, dark and very distinguished
looking Judge and that of the spectators alike was
drawn to bear upon, first, the tone of the prosecu-
tion. It was as if regrettably the charges were
pressed. No victims appeared. The Detective wit-
ness functioned in his performance of duty as if he
testified somehow for the defense.

And when the slightly stammering defendant
took the stand to explain his side, a rustling could
be heard. Because of the unexpected turn to this
“‘routine’’ case, the jury wished to come forward.
They wanted to hear more clearly. Judge Sporkin
understood, and for a brief moment suspended the
testimony while the jury members came up and filed
into their appointed box.

All eyes were fixed on the open-faced, 5’ 9’’, 160
pound defendant. All ears strained to hear the low
voice that presented more a husband’s distress than
a criminal’s defense. From time to time a jury mem-
ber would shake his head from side to side.

Following the Jenkins trial, sentence was de-

ferred for two months, pending a complete investi-
gation and report to the presiding Judge. As the
defendant was led away, remanded back to the
County Prison at 10th and Reed, a member of the
jury said to him, ‘‘I’m sure things will work out all
plein 11 syOUL,

In prison, Alphonso Jenkins continues to stand
out among his fellow men. For to his role of pris-
oner he has somehow brought the double guiding
role of husband-father, as if the prisoner he is were
shadow beside that great encompassing reality.

‘It’s true I just can’t think of myself as a con-
viet,’’? Jenkins explains, ‘‘Not that I evade the guilt,
but well — tie only chime npnaies reverm.oms min:
mind is my relationship to the people I love, my
family. Maybe a man’s life, even in here, is where
his heart is, I don’t know. A prison experience is
harder on a wife waiting for a husband to come out,
than it is on him. Especially if she is young. A man
can’t just hold out a vague hope to her that when
he is released, they’ll come back together again.
That’s why I try so hard to plan and work to equip
myself to reassure my wife of my intentions and to
help keep up her drive to suffer through a torture
for her that she did nothing to deserve. It has helped
my wife and kids to know that Daddy is trying so
nee, ””

During his imprisonment both Jenkins and his
pretty wife, Edna, have somehow walked a common
road together. Both joimed the Roman Catholic
Church. Their two oldest children attend parochial
school. They share a family dream they eall ‘‘Flam-
ingo Poultry Farm’’ and to that end have taken
many courses. He in Poultry Keeping, Farm Manage-
ment, Turkey Raising, Remodeling and Landscap-
ing and, surprisingly, Commercial Law, to name but
a few.

Yet realizing ‘‘it is a poor mouse who has but
one hole’’, Jenkins is now a tailor, too, but also
works as Shtter Machine Operator in the Box Fac-
tory here. Three-fourths of all his earnings have al-
ways gone through the mails to home . . . which
means to Al, ‘‘wherever Edna and our children are.’’
