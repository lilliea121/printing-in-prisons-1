The Miehle Verticular Press — This is the ‘‘workhorse”’
and the press room is equiped with three of them.
They are flat-bed cylinder presses with the form being
locked in a vertical position. These presses are extremely
versatile and geared for speed. They are used for printing
booklets, a variety of forms, catalogs, letterheads and
brochures. They are adaptable to most types of printing
from rough work on coarse paper to the finest halftone
and color process reproduction on coated paper. Shown
in picture are pressmen Wade Horner and William
Hamilitt. :

The Miehle Horizontal Press — This is a flat-bed cyl-
inder press also, and is the largest one used in the print-
ing plant. Jobs run on this press consist mostly of large
forms, Pencor can labels and book work requiring signa-
tures from four to sixteen pages. It is the most difficult
press to operate in our plant and requires a greater
degree of training. The EASTERN ECHO was printed
exclusively on this press for the first six of its ten year
existence. Also shown in photo (far right foreground) is
the Envelope Press. Men appearing below are pressmen
William Hamlitt (left) and James Robinson.
