HANGINGS. FLOGGINGS WERE
FART OF EARLY PENAL CODES

Ed. note: The following article by Dr. Teeters,
professor of sociology and anthropology at Temple U.,
is the first of a series on public executions in lennsyl-
vania from 1682, when the colony was founded by
William Penn, to 1834, when public executions were
abolished in favor of “less pubhc” affairs within the
walls of jailhouses.

Dr. Teeters’ complete list of public executions in
the Commonwealth and a narrative will appear in the
Lancaster County Historical Society Journal, Winter
Issue.

Surprisingly enough, a woman was the first per-
son to be executed in William Penn’s mild and humane
colony. She was Judith Roe. Her crime was murder;
her victim unknown. Her home was in Kent County,
now part of Delaware, but in 1688, when she was
nameedl, i was One Of tne “Lower Coumiies” Of ine
Province.

Penn knew of the case, referring to her as a “mur-
therous woman,’ and to her crime as “notorious and
barbarous.’’ He denied her appeal for a pardon, so on
March 15th, 1688 she went to the scaffold.

Premeditated murder was the only crime calling
for capital punishment during these early colonial
years. But by 1718, indentured servants and trans-
ported felons were beginning to overrun the Province.
These persons were shipped to all the colonies by the
Mother Country, to be rid of them. In that year, some
12 crimes were made capital offenses by a new penal
code. Coincidentally, William Penn died that year, but
he had lost control of the colony before the new laws
were passed.

Negroes, however were dealt with by more drastic
MNS, Siete aS carly aS MOOR, Waey were inreated
severely for even the most piddling offenses.

For example, a Philadelphia ordinance stated
that constables had the authority to “take up Ne-
groes whom they found gadding abroad without a
ticket from their Mr. or Mrs., and to carry them to
gaole (jail), there to remain without food or drink
and to cause them to be publickly whipped next
morning with 39 lashes well laid on their bare backs
for which their Mr. or Mrs. should pay the whipper.’”

In 1701, Penn and his advisers found it expedient
to impose special drastic penalties for crimes committed
by Negroes. In addition to hanging for several offenses
other than murder, castration was to be imposed for
rape or attempted rape on a white woman. Special
courts were set up to try these Negro cases, but, un-
fortunately, we have no records to show how many
victims of this differential jurisprudance were execu-
itecl ir Casitraiect,

At this time, however, the provincial council rue-
fully stated that Pennsylvania was “Ye greatest refuge

himself stated that no place was more overrun than
Philadelphia, where things were done “very scandalous,
openly committed in defiance of the law and virtue,
