simple words it was nothing more than whaling the
tar out of your opponent. In those days, when a
man was accused of any civil or criminal offense he
could face his accuser in the presence of qualified
judges and fight it out with no holds barred. The
winner being legally declared right in the dispute.
The loser, of course would, as the saying goes, ‘‘Be
left holding the bag.’’ Out of this system of law
and justice emerged champions or substitutes, be-
cause very often women and feeble men who could
not defend themselves had to hire professional
fighters to do battle for them. This training and
keeping fighting champions for hire became ‘‘Big
Business’’—and many were schemers and connivers
who became rich on it’s profits. This system of law
and justice existed for many years. Finally King
Edward signed a decree that anyone accused or
challenged to a trial by battle could refuse and
demand a trial by jury. It was not until 1819, how-
ever, that the law was entirely wiped from the books
in England. So it is only a little more than a 100
years ago that a defendant had the right to insist
that his prosecutor ‘‘Put Up His Dukes’’ to prove
his accusations against him.

For Consideration

EDITOR’S NOTE: The following questions were
submitted to the Institution Staff ee of Mon-
cay, Aovell Zl, Uae

Question :

Why are eye glasses so expensive?
Staff Answer:

Any interested optician can bid on the contract
for eye glasses. You cannot estimate the cost of
eye glasses by newspaper advertisements.

(Juestion :
Inmate committees have been successful in other
institutions. Why not have one here at E.S.P.?

Staff Answer:

The success of inmate committees has not been
fully established and in many institutions proven
wanting. We feel that our present program is more
individualized and is sufficient to handle all prob-
lems. In addition it is consistent to modern prison
philosophy and practice.

(Juestion :

Why couldn’t men trying to get jobs lined up
preparatory to release get a statement from the
Treatment Staff listing 1.Q., aptitude and other in-
formation helpful to a job seeker:

Staff Answer:

This institution welcomes contacts with poten-
tial employers and encourages prospective employers
to interview the prisoner who will soon be released.
That information which is not of a confidential na-

ture and will not embarrass the prisoner, his family
or friends, is available to a prospective employer.
This would include aptitude, work performance, pre-
vious experience, institutional experience, etc. -@y

TEN YEARS TOPS

In Cuba, there is no death penalty and the maxi-
mum term allowed by the Constitution is 20 years.
All lifers are entitled to a fifty percent deduction
for good behavior.

There is no such thing as parole, and en a
prisoner goes free before his time is up for good be-
havior, he is as free as any other human being and
not subject to any restrictions. The practical result
is that with good behavior, nobody is in prison for
more than 10 years—The RAIFORD RECORD

FRIEND OF THE INMATES

Judge helps prisoners right wrongs. Circuit
Judge Dale Souter believes that when a man is sen-
tenced to a prison a judge ‘‘should do something
for him as well as to him.’’

‘‘T want him to feel that I’m at his side,’’ he
told the State Corrections Commission at Lansing, -
Michigan.

Souter spends hundreds of hours and dollars
to help the men he has sent to prison from his court
in Grand Rapids, where he has served thirteen years.

Souter, 69, will retire from the bench next year.

oners have inflicted on each other.—The RATFORD

MICHIGAN FIGHTS CRIME BY HELPING
EX-CONVIOTS FIND EMPLOYMENT:

The Michigan Employment Service Commission
has maintained a special service department since
1948. Its function is to help parolees get a job.

Mrs. Flored Desmond, Detroit, is in charge of
the department and, aided by counselors and a sec-
retary from the Ionia, Michigan prison, has enlisted
the help of Detroit businessmen in placing more than
21,000 parolees on jobs.

This unit is the only one of its kind in the coun-
try. The department works directly with parole
officers in selecting jobs for men and women from
both state and federal penal Institutions.

“Tt is the purpose of our department to develop
a job for the parolee,’’ Mrs. Desmond advised men
attending the parole school plan.

When queried as to how employers feel about
hiring ex-convicts. Mrs. Desmond remarked, ‘* Any
man who tells the truth when he fills out his ecard
has just as @ood a chance of getting a job as any

other person.—The JEFFTOWN JOURNAL “]}
