SPORTWISE AND OTHERWISE
by Henry Myers

STANLEY KETCHEL, oft times considered by many in the
history of fistiana (pound for pound) as the greatest fighting
machine that ever tossed leather.

RAY ROBINSON would have KO’d him in five rounds.
MARCIANO would have gone the route with the ‘BROWN
BOMBER’... and he would have been brutalized in the
process =...

DEMPSEY could not have lasted with either...
MARCIANO, DEMPSEY, LOUIS: All cinches for the square
trap’s greatest, the boilermaker, JIM JEFFRIES!

On a day late in Autumn, a nation will stand and cheer
a ‘‘youth’’ as he circles the base paths for his 60th round-
trip-cireuit-clout—equaling the Bambino’s record. Let him
hug that coveted crown close to his chest, where the heart is,
lest the winds of fact blow it away. The ‘Bambino’ would
have doubled his own record in the current tailor-made
‘¢dollar sign’’ ball parks with the likewise designed spirited
horse hide, which created a million-dollar industry in head
gear, and converted the ‘‘National pass-time’’ into a
er clistimon duel.

Cherry Hill’s eleven would trounce Graterford, Pitts-
burgh’s Wall and White Hill in a triple-header!!!! (Have
shoulder pads and helmet, will travel!)

Using ‘‘time’’ as a shield, naturally, I feel pretty safe.
But ... who can unequivocally say that I am wrong in my
assertions? Who owns the barometer, the yard stick, to
measure yesterday’s champs against today’s? Yet, I have
left myself wide-open in my highly controversial but posi-
tive statement—Cherry Hill to whip Graterford, Pittsburgh,
and White Hill. Well, ‘‘Buster,’’ there is an outside chance
when road trips won’t be just a pipe dream. Until that
day arrives, I’m right! WANNA BET? Odds are dollars
to doughnuts, but that’s only even money with the high
Coste of livin =.=,

NOTES WHILE BENCH WARMING
by William Conrey

Harry (Spots) Fricker has been awarded first prize as
the best trained spectator of the year! Not only does he
know how to ‘‘heckle’’ the players, but he knows when...
He also states that with the coming season of softball,
hes willesper tie home num kine 2? of “58 in Cherny Hall}
Look out, Jake!!

Notice to all managers of all leagues! Contact Knock-
Knock for open dates to play his ‘‘All-Stars.’’ Knock
says, ‘‘I would like to make one stipulation to any and all
clubs that play against the ‘‘Stars.’’ That they keep the
games clean, and leave the umpires call ’em as they see ’em,
and take their beatings (that we will surely hand them)
like a sportsman should.’’ Let it be remembered by ‘‘any’’
who may think Knock-Knock is ‘laying it on’ a little heavy,
that his ‘‘Stars’’ have yet to lose a championship game,
and from all indications he don’t intend to lose any this
year just because he’s one year older! I venture to say
that his merger with Jim Ford has given him inspiration.

From all indications, things are actually beginning to
take shape sports-wise. The managers aren’t waiting until
the last moment to sign up their players for the season
ahead. They are scouting now for the sluggers and men
for key positions. So, beware, you may be being scouted
this very moment, and age is no barrier!

At this viewpoint the only drawback is the weather .

ATTENTION ALL HANDBALL PLAYERS: Singles Champ

22

Jenkins is in rare form. Claims he will take on any three
men, even up, and give odds up to five (5) points to any in-
dividual daring enough to put him to the test. Any takers!!

A new champ has taken over the bocce courts. Henry
Sincavage lays claim to the title and will take in all comers,
on any court.

SPORT SHOTS
by Charles Tobin

Bob Nelson looked impressive while in action on the
basketball court for the first time. Although this was a
pick-up game, I’m to understand the Hawks, manager, Will-
iam Howard is looking him over... Best of luck Bob...
Walter Curry also tried his hand but gave up with a huff
and a puff, and a walk-away ... Don’t give up, pal—Sports-
manship rates high above ability . .

We see where Charles Edwards has improved his bocce
game ... Look, out, Ceaser, your title is being threatened . .

Foots and Big Mack have more in common than music
and song. We notice they both play a superb game of
handball ... A thrill to watch them in action. Old pros,
such as Billy Holmes, Hill Billy, Jenkins, Battles, O’Brien
and Doc better oil up their legs because these boys are
seeking titles.

Although they are beginners, Big Bill Conrey and Ed-
ward Brooks make a fine horseshoe team. In way of ex-
planation for victory, Bill says with jubilation, ‘‘You’ve
got to pitch with authority.’’

Bob Harris says he can’t wait until the softball season
to prove his sports ability ... Bob is the fellow who walks
around all day with his hands in his pockets. (That’ll be
the day. Ha! ha!)

A very good exhibition of clean play is oftimes seen
on beginners handball court, behind third block. It’s en-
joyable to play as well as to watch.

If anyone is interested in learning the art of basketball,
see either Charles Adderly or Tiny Berry. Their time is
your time.

EDITORIAL by Joe McNeair

Commissioners, managers and players, let’s work toward
establishing an institution Championship team this year,
and regard the game called Softball as an American sport
and play it that way.

Starting the 1958 season, a few resolutions will certainly
help keep the teams and leagues together.

Suggestive resolutions as following to:

Commissioners: I will maintain my integrity by being fair
and impartial at all times when rendering
a decision.

Managers: I will try to find what is best for the team,
and thereafter do my utmost to see that the
highest results are obtained, even though it
may mean giving up my managership.

Players: I will try to respect my manager’s judgment.
Although at times I may feel he is wrong I will
do my best to make it right, because, my main
objective when on the playing field is to play with
the team and to give my all in trying to win.

I know there may be times when I wont be
in the starting line-up, but I will not let such
cause me to sit around or leave the game grum-
bling and hoping my team loses nor will I try to
break the morale of my team-mates by criticising
my manager’s strategy.
