It’s obvious that Mr. Bowes did just that while
he was imprisoned—and a whole lot more than that
for himself.

SNOOPY SETTLES THE HASSLE \?@

Jimmie Daunt reports: THERE ARE NO
TIGERS IN AFRICA, BUT THERE ARE LIONS
IN INDIA.

Believe it or not, this is a perennial among
debates. The last time the question arose, Joe Oliver
settled it by saying, ‘‘Oh, well, at my age, what’s
the difference,’’ after which ‘‘a whole office full of
people fell silent and just stared.’’ Everybody
knows Oliver is 68 years old, but what has that
got to do with the price of tigers? lions, either,
for that matter.

CALLING DOCTOR SNOOPY 4

Everyone knows the Medical Department would
not be caught dead prescribing narcotics. However,
to his eredit be it known that the Medical Director,
Doctor Nathan Blumberg, established here for a
period of thirty years or so, has been conducting a
search for the ideal sedation which is: (1) NON-
narcotic (2) NON-habit forming (3) NON-
barbituate (4) harmless, for use in prescription
to those inmates who because of a temporary period
of tremendous stress lose the ability to sleep. This
experimental sedation, I am told, does NOT produce
a ‘“‘high’’ or exhilarated feeling ... nor does it even
induce sleep. The whole point is to enable a natural
sleep, a natural awakening, to men experiencing in-
somnia through acute body tensions caused by anx-
lety, worry and grief.

Enough cannot be said for a man who, without
compromising his professional standards, yet re-
mains sensitive to the needs of even the prisoner in
distress. In searching for an answer to this problem
which will meet the requirements of his conscience
and professional code, Dr. Nathan Blumberg earns

himself a kudo.

the inmates of Southern Michigan Prison, Don is
there to present it to the public. It is significant that
in none of the work seen does Don feature himself.
Instead, he extolls prisoners participating in tele-
courses from M.S.U.; features Richard Collins, pris-

model of a 36 foot yawl in 2,340 hours, set it in a
case complete with humidifier and declined a cash

Largely because of Don’s efforts, there is a
citizen interest in the Jackson prison which probably
is unparalleled in any state in the union.

While snoozing with one eye open for Butch the
Cat, and one ear perked up like a good newshound,
Snoopy was awakened by the Warden and informed
“For the record’’ that Mr. ‘‘B’’ hopes to have a
weekly Art Class at E.S.P. Composed of inmates
who have the aptitude and interest for this creative
art, it will be directed by Mr. George Redling, a well-
known artist who has volunteered to donate his
services. The men will begin with sketching and
progress to canvas and oils. If YOU are interested,

The Warden further stated that the men will be
able to purchase Paint By Number Oil Painting
Outfits through the Commissary. Why not try a
Kit for size? It may fill some of those long leisure
hours spent in the cell. Natcherly, each man will
be responsible for the care of his own paints.

SNOOPY INSPECTS THE HOSPITAL Ss
The laugh of the quarter is nurse Whitey Fran
Raimer dashing madly about the Hospital wards
pleading with the patients, ‘‘Look! My home town
newspaper. THH NORTH DAYTON TRANSCRIPT.
Right from Massachusetts. You guys want to read
it, huh?’’ So far, nuttin. The patients all think
North Dayton is a lost valley in the Ozarks.

Then there is the case of Bobby Singleton. At
the drop of a hospital chart, he will inform the
patient that there is no cure like a good massage.
They say he had one of the doctors half-convinced
to install a Turkish Bath. Maybe he has a point at
that. One sure thing; anyone who has lain in a
hospital bed for a while certainly appreciates a
fellow like Singleton who is always courteously
willing to massage those sore, stiff muscles.
