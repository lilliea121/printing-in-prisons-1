With the second half underway the Falcon’s have
taken the league lead with five games out front. But
the Braves have caught fire and are breathing hard
on the necks of the Birds. In a three game series
the Braves chalked up the only defeats the Falcon’s
have. With this in mind the green shirted Birds
must stave off this on-rush of the angry Braves in
order to clinch the championship. Yes, we have our

The Mexican League ended their first half of the

season with the Mets winning the top spot and were
far ahead of the other three teams. The credit for
this surge by the Mets, goes to Mack and his co-
partner on the field, Johnny Downs. Mack the for-
mer owner has since been transferred elsewhere,
while Johnny still plays ball fer the up and coming
Cardinals, who wound up in the cellar during the
first half. They are the hottest club in the loop right
now; and the rumor is that the Cards will be the team
to beat during this second half. Winding up in sec-
ond were the Rangers, now managed by Big Dawk-
ins, a former Met player and a fiery competitor who
has his eyes on the top spot this second half. | firmly
believe the battle for first place lies with the Cardi-
nals and the Rangers, for they have the strongest
clubs in their respective league.

The Lynx’s managed by Dupree is certain of one

thing if nothing else, third place belongs to him.
From the looks of the race from my point of view,
I see nothing else in sight for the Lynx’s but third.
I'd love to be proven wrong, by the resurgence of
the Lynxs for I know softball is a sometime crazy
game, crazy indeed. Last on the totem pole dwells
the original Mets a team to be feared whenever they
played, and under the guidance of their new owner,
Brownie, they shall remain at the bottom. Even
though they are a team, they don’t come near as a
threat against the other three clubs. It’s known
around the loop they have no unity nor any hitting
power in their lineup to speak of. I only hope Brow-
ie, comes up with a secret weapon to alter this non-
progress of his team. With the second half now in
full swing he better look around for a lethal weapon
to counteract the pitching and heavy guns of the oth-
er three teams, if not, he'll stay on Doctor’s call
through the long hot summer.

Having ended the first half in second place, the
Rangers have their sights on first place during this
second half. It was in the latter stage of the first half
that ““‘Big Dawkins’ took over as Manager of the
Rangers, and did a splendid job with the Rangers
who were floundering around between third and sec-
ond place. Now they are a pennant contender and
are capable of shooting down the fiery Red Birds,
who also has designs on first place. It will be a hard
fought duel between these two clubs whom are one
and two either way in the race. The Rangers have
the speed on the base paths with, Nick, Melvin and
Holley; plus, they have good sticks when at bat.
Proof of this came about with the bases crammed,
Holley came forth and blasted the ball for the first
grand slam of the season. It was no fluke, he really
kissed it when the contact was made. Their owner,
“Big Dawkins,’ Snooks, Mercer, Moose and Craw-
ford all swing a mean stick. With this in mind I'll
go out on a limb by saying, this is the team that must
bear watching. They have so many ways of snuffing
out the opposing teams they may face, like running,
hitting, fielding and their hustle is the best I’ve seen
in the loop this season, and their pitching staff of
Cleve and Mercer, is up to par.
