THE ECHO SPOTLIGHT ON:

THE COMPLEX
THAT IS THREE BLOCK

by BERNARD JACOBS

r. Webster and several other lexicographers

have defined “complex’’ as follows: ‘complex
...noun...A whole made up of complicated or in-
terrelated parts.’’ After several weeks of research
I can safely say that the Hospital sector definitely
Issa. complex. :

When I first arrived here I vaguely remember
being taken late one night to Three Block. My
first impression was that except for the fact the
block was painted white, there was little difference
between it and the other blocks. I have since learned
that there are seven individual sections within the
block. I discovered that except for certain highly
complicated and technical specialties, there are few
eventualities that the Hospital cannot handle. If
the previous sentence in any way inferred that omy
simple and uncomplicated cases are handled, I want
to correct it immediately.

The Medical Director, Dr. N. Blumberg, has
been connected with this institution for more than
30 years. The Medical Staff includes Dr. A. F.
Goracci—Chief Surgeon, Dr. HE. Kelly—Anesthetist,
Dr. F. J. Jodis—Assistant Surgeon, Dr. W. R. Dun-
lop—Chief Resident Physician, Dr. M.F. Joyce—

Resident Physician, Dr. R. B. Sechwartz—Dermatol-
ogist, Dr. F. Mattei—Orthopedist, and Dr. Frewald
—Ophthalmologist.

On entering Three Block the first department
encountered is the Pharmacy. <A look through the
door will usually find Samuel Andrews, hard at
work turning out some of the 2200 or so prescrip-
tions a month that he takes care of.

Adjoining the Pharmacy is the Doctor’s Office.
In this office sick-call is held everyday. There are
three clerks here. David Howard, Charles Gindle,
and Kurt Schulte. Their duties are extensive. Be-
sides keeping all of the Medical Records and files
on all of the inmates, they keep a record of inocu-
lations of new inmates, take temperatures, pulse
rates and blood-pressure. They keep a special file
on patients under special observation and inmates
needing special attention such as epileptics and dia:-
betics. These men also help during sick-call and
hew guard examinations. The hours they keep are
roughly from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily and are on eall
24 hours daily, as are most of the personnel of the
hospital block.
