his mind’s eye which is purely his own way. Miss
West evidently looked for the least complex of these
to place together in book form. I know this was a
tedious chore as no philosopher is simple and all great
philosophies are complex. These poems lean towards
the less complex and do not achieve a purpose as far
as I can see. Most of Miss West’s selections leave the
end to imagination. I truthfully was left cold by the
whole thing. But for those who are of a higher plane
of thought than this book; many other writings of
this nature are available in the library.

As a last review we submit “Newspapers” as bor-
rowed from “The Carolina Israelite” edited by Mr.
Harry Golden who describes newspapers as:
“Newspapers fill a variety of needs. They tell us
what is on sale, what has happened to Winnie Winkle
and Dick Tracy, what halfback is limping at Wednes-
day’s practice and along with all these goodies they
provide some news.”

The Sun Also Rises

Sun Ra is a pianist, most of whose profession-
al life has been spent in Chicago. He has a repu-
tation as a musical eccentric. For his upcoming
New York debut he well present a group, easily
eccentric and much in the tradition to which he
has become accustomed.

According to his own publicity, Sun Ra has
now become Le Sun Ra and he is leading his
Cosmic Space Jazz group (Incidentally, Ra was
The Egyptian sun god, so the name, while re-
dundant, is certainly Emphatic).

In any case, Le Sun Ra plays piano and “sun
harp”, so the press releases state. And with him
are Bernard McKinney, Trombone; Tommy
Hunter, Drums; Pat Patrick, Baritone Sax and
Flying Saucer; Marshall Allen, Alto Sax, Japa-
nese Flute and Morrow; John Gilmore, Tenor
Sax, and Zebra Drums; and—hold on now—
Ronold Boykins, Bass and Fire Place.

Eastern Echo

Medical
Department
Banquet

The medical department of this institution has ap-
proximately forty members on its inmate staff. Prac-
tically all of them are specially trained to do highly
skilled work. These men, and our doctors constitute
our hospital teams. Through the combined efforts of
the teams, the medical department stands ready to
meet any emergency that may arise. It was felt that
the men, and the work they do in rendering medical
treatment was worthy of some consideration. This
resulted in plans for a banquet to honor these people.
The plans were made approved and the banquet was
on Peébruary 15, of this year.

Much lke other honorary affairs catering to a
small group, the banquet was able to be held in the
officers dining room. The meal was excellently pre-
pared and served in traditional banquet style. The
main course featured steak (with all the proper
trimmings), apple pie and coffee. After all were
seated, the most welcome guest speakers appeared.
It was surprising to note that the first speaker was
our own Charles Jones. Not withstanding the humor
his approach created, the text of his message was
directed to the officer’s table, was that of thanks and
appreciation for their gesture of recognition for the
efforts and achievements made. The remaining speak-
ers, Superintendent Mr. Rundle, Deputy Superin-
tendent Mr. Brierly, and Director of Treatment
Mr. Graham, voiced their thanks and words of en-
couragement. Our medical director, Dr. Blumberg
expressed his thanks and stressed the importance of
interdepartmental co-ordination in order to carry on
an effective medical program. The value of having
an opportunity to learn and gain experience in the
specialized areas of hospital work was mentioned
and that these skills could be utilized after release
from prison, as several past associates of this depart-
ment have proven.
