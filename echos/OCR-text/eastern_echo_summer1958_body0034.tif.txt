expression in color

by FRANK H. TERRES

Fer two hours each week, a group of our Inmates
leave the walls of the Penitentiary and revel
amid the beauty of nature’s splendor. They walk
through the woodlands; stroll through the by-paths
of Fairmount Park; sit on the banks of the Schuyl-
kill; and, enjoy all of the beauty of the free world.
This they do, vicariously, by the method of colored
Photography—and through the eyes of their guide
and illustrator. The group, the Art Class—their
guide and illustrator, George Redling.

We have often heard the phrase, ‘‘Artists are
born, not made.’’ However, since my attendance at
the Eastern State Penitentiary School of Art, I dis-
count the statement as ‘‘pure nonsense.’’ I have
witnessed men approach Mr. Redling for the first
time, presenting a crude, mishappen, poorly organ-
ized work as evidence of their latent ability. The
configuration was scaleless. The color design lacked
contrast, or mellow blend. Only the inherent de-
sire of the maker gave any evidence of promise. And
yet, within a short period of time, the transforma-
tion of their work, under the skilled guidance of the
Instructor, began to reflect the beauty that was
awaiting the hand of expression. Crudeness gave
way to delicate stroke. The balance of scale became
apparant. Contrasts and blends reflected, vividly,
the astounding panorama of color presented by
Heaven and Harth. Echoes of color riccocheted
from the Canvas to flash in the eyes of viewers. What
had previously been an Artists Work, became a
Work of Art. In the progress of the individuals,
the Art Class, became a Class of Art. The drab,
colorless Cocoon releases the unchallenged beauty of
a Butterfly. The bold strokes of an Inmate’s Brush,
releases the thoughts of beauty that he within the
lack-luster Penal Uniform.

Everything that develops, must first be born.
Where and how was the Art Class born? I am in-
clined to believe—muceh as the birth of man—it was

a gift of God. The seeds of color expression were
planted deeply within the Inmates. They needed
the cultivation in order to burst forth in riotous
bloom. Strangely enough, it was through a servant
of God that Mr. Redling became our ‘*‘Gardener.’’

His first visit to E.S.P. was at the request of
Rev. Gordon Reynolds, our Chaplain. About one
year ago, Rev. Reynolds, (a personal friend of Mr.
Redling) asked the Artist to come in and look at
the work of an Inmate, who was painting portraits
of relatives. He came as a.Criiic “Through the
efforts of Mr. Thomas Graham, Educational Director,
he remaimed as -an Instructor and tend. Mr.
Graham, long aware of the artistic potentialities of
many of our Inmates, started the Mill to turn. There-
by, from the artistic seeds of the Inmates, a servant
of God, the interest and authority of a Staff member,
plus the enthusiasm and unselfishness of a great
Artist—an Art Class was born.

You may ask, ‘‘Why was George Redling called
in as a Critic?’’—‘What are his qualifications?’’
Our most natural response would be to start listing
his many, many Art Awards, and One Man Shows.
Mr. Redling does not desire us to do that. He is the
type of man who wants the emphasis placed on the
Class and not himself. As George Gobel would say,
“You can’t hardly find them there kind anymore!’’
However, in respect to George Redling, The Artist,
it should suffice to say he is rated as one of “100
outstanding World Artists of the 20th Century.’’
But, it was George Redling, The Man, who witnessed
our need, and unselfishly answered it. This youth-
ful man of 56 years, gives us his talent, joyously.
His enthusiasm, after years of outstanding success, is
convincing evidence of the joy in life that can be
attained by the simple measure of being cognizant
to the everyday beauty around us. He offers his
many talents, of which, Art is only one. This phy-
sically rugged six-foot man of the outdoors has eul-
