HOPE FOR THE DRUG ADDICT CONT'D.

must face our shortcomings and search for the solu-
tions to our problems. We seek guidance back to nor-
malcy and a constructive future when again we are re-
leased. This, we believe, we can and will attain by
our participation in this program. We must be sincere,
truthful and unafraid to bare the facts of our lives and
actions—for it is in these facts—these sometimes diffi-
cult to face indicents where, not only do the problems
lie—but the solutions as well.

This is not a plan of prescribed forces, but a pro-
gram composed of men who know what they want—what
they are—what they were—and with enough insight to
realize what they still can attain in structured living
without resorting to a ‘‘chemical crutch.”’

The realization that somebody cares for such as
we, is a great psychological lift in itself. Each one
of us is humbly thankful to those who are giving so
freely of their time, their efforts, and their knowledge,
to help us gain the stature of good and useful citizens
through the recognizance and understanding of our
personalities.

We realize the road to normalcy will be long and
hard, but I feel each of us can see our goals and a
distant horizon of success. It isinthe hopes for more
understanding for the drug addict that this is written:
for by exposing ourselves we learn, and in turn, we
will be able to teach—to show—that there are correc-
tive measures for the addict without resorting to puni-
tive measures.

It is inevitable that one day society will recognize
and accept the fact that the drug addict does not be-
long in prison, but rather in some treatment center
staffed by medical and psychiatric personnel.

Prison does not serve as a cure to the user of
drugs. It is only a deterrent as it merely delays ow
return. It is only in the understanding and probing of
the formative years of an individual’s life that the
existing problems that led to his addiction can be
brought to the surface and treated. It cannot be by
scratching the surface, but only by probing the some-
times small and, seemingly, insignificant incidents of
that individual’s life. Compositely, these incidents
will tell the counselor the real story that led the in-
dividual to his addiction, and he in turn will show us
the corrective measures—the counteracting steps—that
lead to a life of normalcy. We are in a position to
We know there

is hope WE KNOW there is a cure—the rest is up to us

help ourselves through this program.

—and we grasp it preciously and firmly with meaning.
