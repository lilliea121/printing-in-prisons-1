In response to the many requests for music instrue-
tions, from those inmates who are desirous of learn-
ing as much as possible, but, for various reasons, they
are unable to attend the classes, a music correspon-
dence course can now be obtained. For further infor-
mation, or enrollment, inquire at the music depart-
ment, on 7 Block.

In this course, you will find a series of questions,
along with their answers, that are based solely upon
the fundamentals of music. These studies are espe-
cially prepared for beginners, and are compiled in
such a manner, as to provide a simplified method
through which they can very easily learn what the
basic fundamentals are, and just how they are to be
appled to everything pertaining to music.

While the fundamentals, are those studies that are
the most neglected, they are, by far, the most essen-
tial, and the most important studies that a music
student could possible aequire, for the obvious rea-
son, that they represent the only means through
which every type of music in existence, can be writ-
ten, interpreted, and played. It is also through this
medium, that musicians are able to exchange ideas,
and that every type of musical arrangement, and im-
provisation, is made possible. Just imagine, if you
can, what it would really be like, if, the composers,
and the arrangers, had no standard visible means of
conveying their knowledge and ability to the players,
and the players, likewise, had no standard visible
means of receiving it.

Before these studies begin you will be given a
general description of some of the obstacles and dif-
ficulties that beginners and students create for them-
selves, with the hope that you will benefit from their
mistakes, and will avoid them, if, the right kind of
progress, and the proper development, is desired to
be attained.

Every instructor and teacher of music is aware of,
and will readily acknowledge, that, aside from some
physical disability, the most outstanding reasons for
the large number of failures that occur among the
vast majority of the students and beginners who de-
sire to learn how to play music, can be attributed to
the following important facts. (1.) Most of the stu-
dents and beginners of the present era, are very
fickle, and are unable to convince themselves, that
they need a thorough musical education, before they
will be able to play musie according to the standard
requirements that it demands. (2.) They have no de-
sire to learn how to play music according to those
methods that have been tried, and proven to be cor-
rect; they are looking for shortcuts, secret formulas,
or any system that they can use to eliminate their
need for studying music in the only way that it can
be properly learned. (3.) They display the kind of
reasoning, that is to be expected from a spoiled child;
for they have to be pampered, petted, pacified, ap-
peased, rewarded, and induced, to participate in any
kind of a program that will enable them to acquire
knowledge. (4.) They do not have the determination,
or the desire to achieve anything, if, they have to
