diverts the responsibility from society for the
moment.

“‘Tf improvement is impossible under the pres-
ent laws, so much the worse for the laws. And if
we do not know definitely how to attain results then
why not begin to learn. Even if it becomes neces-
sary to establish schools for experiments.”’

For Con sideration

The following suggestions were submitted to
the Warden and the Staff on April 26th, 1957.

Norman Scribner:

We have been granted permission to order
newspapers from outside publishers, but yet the
printed matter on the institution letterheads states
quite definitely that ‘‘NO NEWSPAPERS WILL
BE ALLOWED”’’. This statement is very mislead-
ing and I would like to suggest that the letterheads
be re-worded to dispel any misunderstanding that
might arise on the part of the publishers, family or
friends.

Staff Answer:

As soon as the present stock of letterheads is
depleted, new ones will be issued with this heading
omitted.

Richard Patrick LeRoy:

Many publishers are now issuing paperbacked
editions of current best-sellers in the fields of both
fiction and non-fiction. The difference in costs can
be as high as two to three dollars per copy. Would
it be possible to review the present policy which
prohibits purchase of any paperback?

Staff Answer:

If these books are approved by the Librarian,
they can be purchased.

Unknown Inmate:

The staff answer to the question concerning in-
mate purchase of typewriters was ‘‘No comment”’
(Spring Issue 1957). What I would like to know
is WHY inmates are not permitted typewriters.

Staff Answer:

Because there is a Bureau of Correction policy
that no typewriter can be purchased for individual
use in cells.

For the Echo Record

As the result of a nation wide survey conducted
by THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC
OPINION, it has been statistically revealed that:

“‘Mieht of ten Americans agree with modern
criminologists that, in dealing with men in prison,
it is more important to get them started on the right
road than it is to punish them for their crimes.

‘‘Only one adult in 6 (16 per cent) in the latest
Institute survey thinks it is more important to place
the major emphasis on punishment.

‘‘According to a leading authority, penologists
today are generally agreed that ‘the prison serves
more effectively for the protection of society against
crime when its major emphasis is on rehabilitation.’

‘Institute interviewers posed the question to a
cross-section of American adults in the following
manner:

‘By education, the strongest sentiment for
major emphasis on rehabilitating men in prison
comes from college-trained persons. The following

‘“‘Midwest: 15 per cent, punish them; 78 per

“South: 20 per cent, punish them; 74 per

‘“‘Har West: 9 per cent, punish them; 84 per
