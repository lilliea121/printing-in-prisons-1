The above quotation brings to mind a man who
does everything humanly possible, in his never-end-
ing effort to help people and see that they do not
have to walk alone. It is a pleasure and indeed a
privilege to unfold this story .....

Periodically throughout the year, just as sure as
the leaves fall from the trees during the Golden
Month of Harvest, a group of men are seen walking
through the maze of alleys and by-ways that are
inter-laced between the cell-blocks, shops, and build-
ings of this institution. They are on their way to the
Synagogue for religious services and an informal chat
with the man who is walking with them. HE IS A
SMALL MAN IN STATURE ONLY! His sparse
white hair sprinkles over his head like freshly fallen
snow on a mountain-top and the glasses he wears can
never conceal the dancing joy he experiences as he
takes another stride toward the unlimited faith and
trust that he has in people—regardless of their reli-
gion, race or creed.

Like many of his contemporaries, who subsequent-
ly went on to become great humanitarians, he gladly
heaps upon himself the responsibility of providing
his fellow man with any and all help within the mar-
gin of feasible reasoning.

He belongs to an illustrious company of both men
and women who have done so much for so many in
return for so little, and his only dividend is to realize
that someone he has helped has made the most of
his kindness and has gone on to better things in life.

As the group of men reach the Synagogue and seat
themselves in a circle about this man, the tensions
of everyday prison life are temporarily melted away
by the infectious smile which is a constant part of Mr.
Bernard Watman’s character.

After shaking the hand of everyone present and
inquiring as to each man’s welfare, Bernie (as he
likes to be called by one and all) then conducts a
religious service with a serene, sincere and devoted
attitude and approach that enthralls the group of
men, and instills within the souls of those in attend-
ance, a sense of well being and gratitude.

At the conclusion of the service Bernie will tell
stories relating to current events, local news which
he feels will be of interest to men whose homes are
in the city of Philadelphia, and monitor a question
and answer session between himself and the men. He
generally colors his conversation with a shade of
humor whenever he can because he seems to know
that laughter is a rare commodity “behind the wall.”’

He has the enviable trait of speaking to a crowd
and making each person feel as though he is being
spoken to as an individual. His visits are enjoyed so
very much by everyone that it seems only a day or so
after his last visit when the question arises among
the men, “1 wonder when Bernie will be in again>?”’

Born and raised in Philadelphia, he has for years
been a reputable and highly respected business man
in his community. And although the small depart-
ment store he owns takes up a good portion of his
time, he nevertheless finds the time to visit not only
this institution, but also Holmesburg Prison, the
State Correctional Institution at CGraterford, the
