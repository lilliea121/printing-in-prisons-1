know when a cover appeals to the eye. Meeks is

doing a great job in this department.

Everybody who is able to beg, borrow or steal
a copy of your mag will eget a big laugh out of the
jokes done by Dewey Sizemore and Joe Meeks.

Got a chuckle out of Jesse Nelson’s “My Cat.”
We have had a number of cats in this “joint” for
years, all females, believe it or not.

A Tom-Cat got in here the other day on a lum-
ber truck and you would have thought there was a
public-enemy loose within these walls. Custody
wanted to parole this male immediately but I under-
stand he’s still “Wanted”.

LAKE SHORE OUTLOOK

Pve been on the ECHO staff for only a few
months and this is the first time I’ve got hold of
“The Lake Shore Outlook.” I might be excused be-
cause of the number of Penal Press Publications that
we receive, but I doubt it.

“Parole Board Results” is one item that caught
my attention, and one of the listed decisions was:
7 Returned P.V.’s were set 2 years to Full Time.
This imphes that these seven men had a larger maxi-
mum yet to serve, but were given this reduction in
sentence to full time by the Parole Board. Many of
our Technical P. V.’s, who have only stepped on a
Parole Rule to be brought back, would be glad to
receive such a break.

The editorial on “The Parolee’s Job” was an
informative piece of work. We liked it.

I was upset when I glimmed “Miss 4th of July”,
but on turning the page I got a gander at I.S. P.’s
Commissary List. I almost had a fit of apoplexy.
I went through the “Tobacco” List like a flash, for
I don’t smoke. I skipped through “Medications”
with a sickly grin as I rubbed my oversized bunion.
Then, my troubles really began! Under “Grocer-
ies”, Bananas, Oranges, Gee! Peanut Butter, Pimen-
to Glass Cheese, Limburger Glass Cheese, Sandwich
Spread, Tea, Sugar, COFFEE? Boy, oh Boy, that
Coffee did it.

We had a rumor going around here that we
were going to get Coffee (I hate that word), but just
lately we were told that it was only a rumor and
that we not only weren’t going to get it, but, the
Western State Pen was not going to renew its con-
tract for Coffee when the present one ran out. We
hope this may be reeonsidered.

I may not be the first to congratulate R. L. Mose-
ley on his article, but I do not want to be the last,
either. This is the type of able and penetrating writ-
ing that we need throughout the Penal Press so that
the public can know of and understand this problem
of a human being (in this case a Judge) who sets
himself above the laws on the books, and as you say,
“Such laws would seem to recognize the possibility
of extenuating circumstances, of reform, or sufficient
punishment, and last, but not least, that mercy is
also human quality and may be exercised.’~ THE END

SUPREME COURT JUDGE ADVISES
ON PAROLE POINTS AND
CHARACTER TRAITS

Detroit, Michigan — Speaking before the 88th
Annual Congress of the American Correctional
Association at Detroit, Michigan, Supreme
Court Justice George Edwards, of Michigan,
spoke of the qualities parole authorities should
seek in examining men applying for parole. He
stressed four points in his talk:

1. Self-discipline

2. A sense of achievement

3. Moral and religious values

4. Ability to make worthwhile friends.

The American Correctional Association
dedicates itself to seeking better, more effec-
tive means of rehabilitating prison inmates.

LOCAL JUDGE DEFENDS PARDON BOARD

Philadelphia, Pa. — In a recent address, Judge
Curtis Bok, of Common Pleas Court 6 of Phila-
delphia, Pa., lashed out at the local neswpapers
for their attacks against the Pennsylvania Par-
don Board.

“A local newspaper,” stated Judge Bok,
“says that the Governor released sex fiends,
burglars, murderers and robbers from prison.”
Judge Bok asked, “Whom else would you re-
lease from prison? There are no Sisters of
Mercy or Protestant Bishops in prison.”

“T go to the prisons and see these people,”
Judge Bok said. “It is easy to kick a convict
when he is down. He cannot sue for libel.
Therefore, we get halftruths and lies.”
