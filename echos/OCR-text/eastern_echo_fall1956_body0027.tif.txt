in this country—between 60,000 and 600,000—for
whom the drugs are worth more than their own
bodies and everlasting souls, there is an incalcul-
able profit to be made from selling narcotics.

However, according to the recent Bill sponsored
by Senator Peter J. Camiel, and signed into law,
the pushers, if nabbed, will have to share some of
this profit; otherwise they go to jail in default.
Here’s how our new Pennsylvania drug law lines up:

Peddlers guilty of a third offense are liable to
fines of $15,000 or Life imprisonment; not both.
The new series of penalties for addicts, in contrast,
are as follows:

First offense, two years flat, and/or a $2,000
fine; second offense, ten years flat, and/or $5,000
fine; third offense, thirty years flat, and/or $7,500
fine. (Particular attention is called to the phrase
‘‘and/or’’ which denotes that both a jail sentence
and a fine may be imposed). Note there is no jail
penalty for the peddler as long as he can pay the
license fee..... beg your pardon, that should have
read ‘‘fine’’. However, it’s strictly COLD TURKEY
if you’re hooked PLUS the fine. Looks like some-
body goofed, eh?

Bill Green Leaves Sans Parole

Guard Bill Green, better known as ‘‘The
General’’, retired on July 16th, after 28 years of
service. We will all miss him as he believed all
the tales he told. He has always aspired to be a
champion. If you should see a white-haired old
gentleman running up Fairmount Drive in a Frog-
man’s suit, it will be the General training for the
Underwater Championship of the Schuylkill River.
Bill, we are in your corner. .. .Warden.

Conversation

This boy happened to have his ear close to the
wall when he overheard the following conversation
between Joe Winter, Linotypist in the Print Shop,
and our Editor:

Winter: ‘‘There have been many fellows that
have discussed the ECHO with their buddies, why
not a page for the criticism or commendation of the
ECHO?’’

Editor: ‘‘We’ve been a part of some of those
discussions and when we invited the fellows to write
it up and send it to us they demurred. For some
reason the fellows hate to take pen in hand. How-
ever, I feel that our ‘Letters to the Editors’ has
received some attention as noted in this and the
previous issue.”’

Winter: ‘‘I’ve heard said that all articles are
being written for the specific purpose of praising
the present and past officials and the institution
in general.’’

Editor: ‘‘If so, I’m not aware of it. If ref-
erence is made to the three profiles (Barbour,
Gernert and in this issue, Banmiller) I can only
say that when a person, official or inmate, warrants
space in this publication he shall have it. It is
primarily an inmate publication, but who can be-
grudge space to the men mentioned above. I need
not defend our stand on those articles for the men
here who know or have known the above will, I’m

Eastern Ecuo

sure, add their Amen. And who’s praising? Just
the facts, bud, just the facts. At one of our staff
conferences it was decided that each issue would
contain a profile of an inmate personality. Want
to know how far we got with it? Outside of Patsy,
we have received refusals from everyone we ap-
proached. And I can hardly be accused of de-
voting each issue to the officials or institution.’’

Winter: ‘‘Why not feature an article on some
of the inmate help?’’

Editor: ‘‘That is one of the things we have in
mind as a feature but we are looking around for a
writer for that project.’’ (Any volunteers???)

Winter: ‘‘Surely, there are inmates in the
institution who have helped other inmates, why not
devote some space to them?”’

Editor: ‘‘If you mean give them some pub-
leity, I doubt very much if they would appreciate
our broadcasting what to them is probably a person-
al matter.’’

Winter: ‘‘If this is going to be a paper for the
inmates and completely written and printed by the
inmates, let us give them a little consideration.”’

Editor: ‘‘Joe, we weren’t aware that we were
slighting the inmates. If we are we all will stand
to be corrected. We have repeatedly requested sug-
gestions of any nature in which we may serve the
inmates more fully. In fact, yours truly was se-
verely brought up short during the compiling of
this issue when requesting certain information for
the inmates.’’

Winter: ‘“‘The law requires that a person
applying for commutation of his sentence be given
space in the newspaper of his county where he was
convicted. Is it not possible for the same to be done
here, where he is serving his sentence? I am sure
that this is of interest to all of us, if for no other
reason than it may be our friend who is applying.’’

Editor: ‘‘We are not covered by the same law.
Also, you must take into consideration that ours is
a quarterly magazine and we could not keep abreast
of the monthly applications. As for the results, let’s
face it, the grapevine is a much speedier way of
broadcasting it.’’

Welcome Temipus!

It was with great satisfaction that I read
through the initial issue of Graterford’s magazine,
TEMPUS. For a publication devoted entirely to
institution events and personalities it was excellent.
However, the Staff members of EASTERN ECHO
had hoped that we might work in conjunction with
TEMPUS Staff members in presenting to the public
some of the problems of the inmates of our insti-
tutions and give the public a ‘‘window’’ through
which they might see into our world.

I could not give individual credits here for all
your fine writers, but I must mention Red Mc-
Cullough’s (why the numbers?) fine handling of
the Tom Runyon article. Coughlin, may I pass you
a tip? Contact Chuck Wyman. This boy (boy??)
has a vast knowledge of sports in addition to being
able to write some fine articles and fiction. I’ve
read some of his stuff.
