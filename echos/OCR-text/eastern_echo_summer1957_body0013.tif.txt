‘‘Religion is, of course, a comfort for the troubled mind.’’

nothing else can do. But is is entirely false to see
in religion merely a personal channel for escapism,
for distraction from the evils of the world, the evils
of sickness and poverty and sin included. Religion
should challenge us to meet these head-on to combat
them and to conquer them .. . and the principal
consolations of the religious life should come from
the victory which religion inspires us to win over
evil. Religion is an inspiration to collective effort,
not a formula for individual respose.

‘‘Another mistaken notion with regard to re-
ligion is a characteristically modern one. It makes
the assumption that religion is only one of the
many departments of life, even though it be the most
important. To the genuine Catholic man, this notion
is unacceptable. He recognizes that religion, if it
be truly such, provides a pattern for integral liv-
ing, a source of energy for total action. It elevates
the whole of life to a new level; it gives a new
quality to all functions of life, not merely an ad-
ditional quality to those which already existed. The
Catholic man recognizes that his life is not divided

In April, 1957, at the Iowa State Penitentiary,
one of the most widely read and highly regarded
voices of the Penal Press was stilled. The voice that
belonged to Tom Runyon now belongs to all those
who remember him. Like W. B. Yeats, ‘‘he became
his admirers.’’

What, specifically, there is to admire about the
late Tom Runyon is legion. He battled religiously
since the beginning of his 19 or 20 year period of
incarceration to tell ‘‘the convict’s side of the
story’’. Said Tom in the Twenty-Third Anniversary
Issue of PRESIDIO, ‘‘Newspapers, radio, maga-
zines—all were strictly anti-prisoner. Our little self-
supporting 32-page PRESIDIO was a puny David
to face the Goliath that was a whole vindictive
world.’’ Did he dare to tell the prisoners’ story ?
So much so that, ‘‘Inevitably, I suppose, looking
back, I fell out completely and finally with the
Parole Board in 1943, and ended with ... the enmity
of the all-powerful Board of Control.’’

into two series of activities; one natural, as shaving,
whistling or performing daily duties in business or
professions; and the other supernatural, as praying
or receiving the sacraments. By virtue of the
supernatural life, on the contrary, every natural
activity is caught up into a higher and wider sphere
of reality. It is given new meaning and purpose,
new quality, new worth, new and eternal im-
plications.

““So the Catholic man does not departmentalize
this supernatural religion and his natural vocation.
The work by which he wins his bread is also the
work by which he wins eternal life. The most
simple service he does his fellow man acquires
from its religious overtones a dignity which makes
it acceptable to God. The man, living by this con-
cept of his vocation, makes of every day the Lord’s
Day; he does not go to church on Sunday to find
God; he goes to work to find God all week, and
goes to Church to enjoy God and to learn more con-
cerning how God may be found in every word and
work of his daily life.’’

In the course of his career, Tom was in part
responsible for a ‘‘rehabilitation-minded prison’’, he
saw the old night stick guards’ club go, industry pay
raised to $.25 per day, gate money for discharged
prisoners raised (from $5.00, I believe) to $25.00,
humiliating outside numbers disappear from in-
mates’ clothes, less discipline for discipline’s sake—
all things he and other PRESIDIO editors fought to
achieve. His story about Ole Lindquist, ‘‘Iowa’s
forgotten lifer’’, resulted not only in Ole’s freedom
but in the freedom of a number of lifers who would
be forgotten today except for the effect it (his
story) had on top official thinking. He helped win
publie support in behalf of Iowa prisoners ... with-
out which nothing could have been done.

Just before the sudden end of his career, Tom
had this to say:

‘“And now with scant inches of space left, where
was I? Ah, yes! I was chattering about the way
years can slip up on a fellow. Thinning hair and
bi-focals those years have brought, but other things
as well—they have brought a great deal of hard
work and a kind of concentration that can at times
make a man unconscious of passing time.

‘“Where did those years go? They went into
a battle for what I believe, and the other editors be-
lieve, was right. We haven’t won the more im-
portant battles... BUT WE’RE STILL TRYING.”
