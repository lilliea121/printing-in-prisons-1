The place, Korea; the time is the summer of
1950. You are a member of a Rifle Company in a
Regiment of the U. 8. 25th Infantry Division. Your
company is dug in on a ridge overlooking a small
valley. The mission is to hold, regardless. The
fate of many other units rests with you, for you
are in the key position. As the hot sun sinks be-
low the horizon, a quiet settles over the country-
side. An unnatural quiet that comes from silenced
men and nature. Nature that affords you pro-
tective cover and concealment and men who are
anticipating that which is to come. You know
them all. They trained with you in Japan. All
good soldiers, only untried in combat, and soon
they will have their baptism of fire.

Their thoughts are now on that girl back home,
Mom or Dad, that last goodbye in Japan or any
number of other sentimental associations. Among
other things they are asking themselves—Why?”’’
They know the answer, for without them the peace
ean neither be won nor held.

The call is passed for all platoon sergeants,
platoon guides and squad leaders to report to C. P.
Upon arrival you find all of the platoon leaders
assembled with the Commanding Officer. There
is no parade ground formality. With a simple
gesture the Old Man indicates for you to get com-
fortable; stand or sit, it makes no difference. He
proceeds to give you the G-2 Periodic Report which
consists of what is facing you, and so forth. Next
comes the Field Order. The situation is critical.
You are to hold so that another Division may with-
draw and set up four and a half miles to your
rear in a strategic position to cut off the possibility
of the enemy breaking through and commanding
key positions on the main supply route, and to
check their over-all advance, which is inevitable
due to their strength of numbers. Now the com-
pany breakdown is checked. The 2nd platoon is
on the right. The platoon leader confirms this.
The 8rd platoon is on the left. This checks. Two
squads of the Ist platoon make up the combat out-
posts, and two squads are in reserve with the
weapons platoon that has its 60 mm mortars dug
in on the reverse slope of the hill. Three 57 mm
Recoiless Rifles are situated between the 2nd and
3rd platoons. You have a section of heavy 30

caliber machine guns from the Heavy Weapons
Company all in position. Also one 75 mm Recoiless
Rifle that is dug in for maximum support for the
company. All checks.

Now comes the talk from the Old man. He says,
‘‘Men, you know our position. We have a tough
job and few combat vets. Mostly all green men.
So do your best. Give the men a good talk and
instill in them a will to fight and win. It’s getting
late, so get to it.’’ It’s all over. You move around
to the men and give them the works. You know
that they’ll do their best no matter what. They
know how.

As twilight settles, the artillery throw in a few
rounds to zero their guns for your support. Also
the heavy mortars and the 81 mm mortars zero
in.

As dark settles, the artillery observer and ob-
servers for the 4.2 heavy mortars and 81 mm mortars
compare their maps for their zones of impact. All
checks and they prepare their data for any shifts
or changes. As the men huddle in their fox-holes,
you move among them and give a word of encourage-
ment here and there. On your way back to your
hole that you share with your assistant squad
leader, you see one of the B. A. R. men working
lovingly over his weapon. He gives you that
knowing look and a nod, and you move on to your
hole.

The blanket of night has fallen and the twin-
kling stars above look down with silvery eyes on
all here below. You think how many will see
another night or yet—another dawn. Insects are
buzzing about and the mosquitoes are rough. So
you break out the insect repellent and rub it on
heavy. As you pass the bottle to your buddy he
comments on what a lovely night to be on the
beach with a broad. Any beach, any broad. The
moon comes out silvery and bright. You know
what this means. The moon rises early; it’ll go
down early, leaving a cover of darkness that offers
choice cover for the enemy. You can’t change
nature so you settle down for the long wait.
Seconds seem hours, minutes days, and an hour
could very well be a lifetime. As you glance at the
dial of your watch you see that it’s 21:30 hours-
about two and half hours before the show will
