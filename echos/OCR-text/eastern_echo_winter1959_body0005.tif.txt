THE ECHO MAIL BAG

Dear Sir:

I am a State Parole Officer assigned to
the Detroit (Michigan) District.

A large percentage of my caseload have
narcotics backgrounds .. .[ am extremely
interested in increasing my knowledge of
this problem.

5 oo Mpe@mesllihy, I ghan, awmmeiesiee! ais
compiling and analyzing excerpts from
Prison publications on the narcotics prob-
lem. I am interested in what the inmates
have to say about it.

. So I am asking if you will place
me on your (mailing) list.

I feel that my interest in this problem
may result in some additional knowledge
and perhaps contribute to an ultimate
solution. Will you help me?

Hondon B. Hargrove

@ By all means. More of your caliber
needed in the Parole field.

Dear Sir:

Following a match between your and
Smith, Kline and French’s chess teams,
my husband was given a copy of the
EASTERN ECHO. We and our friends
found it most interesting, and I herewith
enclose a check for $5. to cover the cost
of five subscriptions.

Mrs. Joseph Coogan
Phila, 28, Penna.
@® Through such events we are privileged
to meet men such as your husband.

Dear Mike (Editor):

Thanks a million for your generous note
of October 13th and for the issues of
the EASTERN ECHO. Your expression of
friendship makes us feel like a guy in a
Model-T being waved to by a passing
Cadillac, but we want you to know that
a few old issues of the EASTERN ECHO
were a principal source of inspiration for
our modest effort.

. what we lack in experience we’re
trying to make up for in ambition and
enthusiasm...

Your kind offer of an exchange certainly
gives us the long end of the bargain but
will be greatly appreciated. We are out
of our first two ‘‘Ditto’’ machine issues
but we’ll be sure to send along the next
one... Your criticism will be appreciated.

James Patterson, Editor

@ Gee, thanks! Always ready with a
helping hand for our ‘‘Pen’’-Pals.

THE E.S.P. STORY

When he arrived, prisoner No. 1 looked
upon the project that was to become one
of the largest buildings in the U.S. at
the time, in a massively walled enclosure
containing about ten acres. When erec-
ted both male and female prisoners were
received in the penitentiary. The first
female prisoner was received 4-30-1831,

the last remaining until 1923.

EASTERN ECHO

No one will deny that there have been many
changes in penal philosophy within the past one
hundred years. It is very complex and contus-
ing when considered on a national or inter-
national level and even at the state leve! is quite
a jumble since the philosophy of prisons, pro-
bation, parole, pardon and sentencing is ever
changing as a study of these will show. There
is a variance that obviously typifies the think-
ing of the law makers at the time of enactment
of the statutes in these fields. Human nature
changes little—it has been said. However, in
reviewing the laws we wonder. Assuming we are becoming more civil-
ized and penal laws have improved over the last several centuries (less
than 200 years ago over 200 offenses, some petty, were capital offenses
in Eneland, a nation admittedly steeped in tradition and admittedly
the leader in Western civilization) we submit, have we kept pace legally
with improvement in our social structure? Specifically, the rehabilita-
tion of the offender, which necessarily includes his sentence and release.

Originally all sentences were for a definite fixed period and there
was no way to terminate them except through pardon. Not only did
this situation result in many injustices but it offered no way to ease the
return of the offender to the community. It resulted too in a necessary
extension of the pardoning power in order to relieve congestion in the
prisons. Of 2082 prisoners in the Eastern State Penitentiary in 1864,
463 or 22.2% were pardoned by the Governor. There was no other
method at that time! Other methods came into being later to relieve
this situation and eventually culminated in the parole system.

Parole is one of the most modern and important parts of the crim-
inal justice program. At the turn of this century, there were a few
sporadic and disconnected attempts at its practical application.

The “Good Time” laws were a part of the humanitarianism working
to soften the harsh penal codes. They were the beginning of the transi-
tion between rigid, fixed sentences and parole. The transition in Penn-
sylvania embraced these and clearly points out the thinking and philo-
sophies of these eras.

1. The first break in the old policy of fixed sentences came in 1861
with the act of May 1, 1861, PL 462, which was changed in 1869,
act of 5-21-69, P.L. 1267, as the act of 1861 was declared uncon-
stitutional. This was again changed in 1901 by the act of May
11, 1901, P.L. 166, which is still in effect, where “flat” sentences
are imposed. These all provided for reduction of sentences by
good conduct.

William J. Banmiller

2. The first real use of the indeterminate sentence came in 1887
with the Act of April 28, 1887, P.L. 68, as amended in 19538, the
act on Julhy 29, 1958, 1b, 14'4!7.

3. Itwasnt until 1909) the act on May 10> 1909) ay 495s andraitiier

a long period of agitation the principle was partially extended
to the penitentiaries. It provided that in the cases of offenders
to be sentenced to the Kastern and Western State Penitentiaries
the Court “instead of pronouncing upon such convict a definite |
or fixed term of imprisonment shall pronounce upon such con-
viet an indefinite term.” Where no minimum was set by stat-
ute, the Court could determine it, provided it was not over one-
quarter of the maximum prescribed as the penalty for the
erime.

4. However, this was emasculated in 1911 by the Act of June 19,
1911, P.L., 1055, which removed the proviso that the minimum
term must not be over one-quarter of the maximum. It virtu-
ally destroyed the principle of the indeterminate sentence.
Actually there were sentences then after passage of this act of
19 years minimum to 20 years maximum.

5. In 1923) act ot June 29, 1923, Pl. 975 reflected the moderated
thinking and liberalized the previous law. This Act is com-
monly referred to as the Ludlow Act and is now the basic law
still prevailing. Please Turn To Page 11
