aimed at tapping this powerful motivating force.

What are the practical elements which express
this philosophy of Modern Penology in daily man-
agement of human beings? Essentially, there are
four: MODERN PENOLOGY BY OBJECTIVES,
DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY, ACCOUNTABIL-
IGUNE aae: TUNE DE as

MANAGEMENT BY OBJECTIVES

The first element is MODERN PENOLOGY BY
OBJECTIVES. I prefer to contrast this with Mod-
erm Penolosy by authority. You cam Say, = Yes, I
Lowe that thats just routine. Bui as it7) 1am:
econvineed that a number of prison employees still
work to please the man who is their superior—not
to accomplish what they understand to be their par-
ticular piece of the common objective of the entire
organization.

Of course, a clear UNDERSTANDING of the
objectives in the mind of every individual is an ab-
solute essential. It’s impossible for anyone to iden-
tify himself with the accomplishment of the objec-
tive of Modern Penology if he doesn’t understand
it. And if he has no personal identification with the
objective, he has no basis for personal pride of ac-
hievement.

As an individual, no warden or staff member
ean personally do very much at all. His effective-
ness is measured in terms of his ability to influence
other people to get the job done. To take California
as a specific example, those people understand that
they have to be a success or they will not be in busi-
ness. They go to great lengths to demonstrate this
to the people who visit the institution where they
can ask questions and gct the answers of the aspects
of Modern Penology.

The warden and staff held meetings with de-
partment heads and showed them their plans for the
coming years. They spoke to them on this basis:
“You gentlemen are an expanded board of directors
in concept. Please do not rely on us to make these
plans materialize. On the contrary, we’re going to
rely on you. The worst thing in the world you can
do is try to satisfy us as individuals, because we’re
not smart enough—and frankly, we have never met
a man who was smart enough—to direct every activ-
ity in a business as complex as penal institutions.
Work to satisfy the objectives of the undertaking.”

One example that illustrates this point can be
found in the field of correctional officers. Pve talked
with some of these officers and have found them to
be a dedicated group of men. But I was surprised
to learn that some of them were dedicated to cus-
todial duties only. This is an understandable pro-
fessional ideal. But in penology we must qualify it
—dedicated to correctional officer FOR AN UNDER-
TAKING. DV never forget some of the shocked ex-
pressions when I said, “Let me define your job for
you. Unless you rehabilitate a man that can be re-
leased and returned to free society, you have failed
completely in the job of correctional officer. If it

cannot be rehabilitated and returned to society in
a manner that represents sufficient value to society
that they will accept it—then put the plans in the
wastebasket.”

Here’s the framework that must be established:
A warden and his staff must provide the policies
and treatment program within which everyone must
work. ALL must work to follow that program. Don’t
follow one part of it and take great pride in that
part of the job you have to do. It’s the only way
everyone can personally share in the suecess of Mod-
ern Penology, because it’s the only way Modern
Penology can succeed.

So the first principle is Modern Penology by
objectives, based on a clear understanding of the
objectives by each individual and permitting a per-
sonal identification with those objectives. This pro-
vides a basis for the individual to take personal pride
in the job he is doing.

Now, Let’s move on to the second part of this
philosophy.

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY

Authority must be delegated commensurate
with responsibility. Personnel must be selected who
are competent to do their jobs. We assume that
these competent people understand what their jobs
are. We must give them the authority to carry out
their jobs their way. After all, if they are competent
and fully understand their work, that is what they
were hired for.

Getting down to brass tacks, the delegation-of-
authority principle is violated time after time by
some Wardens and staff members who simply can-
not keep their fingers out of the task delegated.
Instead of guiding the activities in terms of objee-
tives to be accomplished and the policy framework
within which operations are to be carried on, they
seem to feel obligated to instruct, as to how one
should go about accomplishing the assigned job. By
so doing, they encourage others to turn to them
more and more for direction and to exercise their
own initiative less and less. In addition, they gradu-
ally rob their associates of personal identification
with the job and of the foundation for the all-im-
portant value, pride of achievement.

When I talk about delegation of authority, I
am talking about 100 percent delegation, not 75 or
99 percent. Of course people will make mistakes,
but a Warden and his staff, not being superhuman
themselves, will also make some. If the price they
pay for close day-to-day direction is robbing their
organization of its initiative and killing individual
pride of achievement, then they have made an ex-
tremely poor bargain.

ACCOUNTABILITY
The third element of this philosophy is AC-
COUNTABILITY, I mean what might be termed a
cold-blooded demand that a man do his job or get
