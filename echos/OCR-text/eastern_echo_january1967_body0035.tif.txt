round.’ This vocal group was fan-
tastic. The audience demanded they
return. But like most things in a
place like this, “‘time’’ was a factor
and we still had more groups to go.

Evan Hall then came on stage
with a saw and bow (that’s’ right
pal, a wood saw). He then positioned
the saw under one knee and across
the other, held it with his left hand,
ran the bow up and down the un-
sharpened end and out came the
most unique sound and the Christ-
mas carol “‘Silent Night.’’ He handled
this difficult task very nicely.

The Roosevelt Minter Quartet was
next, with ‘‘Rosey’’ on trumpet, Son-
ny Lopes, guitar, Holise Johnson,
piano, Billy Goodman, drums, playing
“Minor Blues.’’ This was a swinging
group and it was received with hoots
and whistles and what not.

Next on the program was an alto
sax solo by Dick Keys of ‘‘Purple
Mist” backed up by the band.

Ace Robinson, with his trumpet,
came on strong playing ‘‘A Taste of
Lace,’ supported ably by multi-tal-
ented John Klauzenberg on bass, Bill
Goodman on drums, and ‘‘Shoebox’’
on guitar. This jazz group fitted right
in with the complexion of the show.

Eastern’s Big Band played such
numbers as “White Christmas”
which they opened the show with,
and:

Tijuana Taxi—-The Christmas Song
—Jingle Bells—Plush Reeds, featur-
ing the saxes—The Pink Panther—
England’s Carol, which was a swing-
ing arrangement—Rudolph, the Red-

Nosed Reindeer—Azure Mist (The
Theme).
The featured soloists with the

Stage Band included Milton Logan on
trombone, Roosevelt Minter on trum-
pet and Freddy Adams on tenor sax.

One totally unexpected highlight
was a “Pink Panther” strutting a-
round both the audience and the
stage with his classical walk. He
dared to pinch Mr. Barclay’s cheek
during the number and had his tail
pulled off for his effort. Never to be
outdone, however, the Pink Panther
(S. Cantoral) whipped out a ‘spare
tail’ with a light on the end and
pranced happily out of sight.

The show was the best, and thanks
are coming to those who provided
their talents and efforts to making it
possible.

Special mention goes to Harry
Zietz, Billy Cantoral, Joe Massanova,

A PRISONERS CREED

If I were asked to formulate, behind these prison walls,

A set of rules for just myself, to guard against pitfalls.

I would propose at very first to watch what I may say.

To do my time and mine alone, through every single day.

I never should concern myself with how another acts,

And if I must repeat a tale, be sure it’s based on facts.

If I can’t say just one good word of fellowship this day,
Then I would as soon keep quiet while going on my way.

I will not step on other’s toes by infringing on these rights,
By doing this I will be quite sure of keeping out of fights.

I will not be a ‘‘teller’’ carrying troubles to the man,

I'll solve my problems by myself, or do the best I can.

I will not criticize someone just because I think him odd,
I'll keep my eyes upon myself and leave the rest to God.

I will try to wear a smile all day from beginning to end,
Instead of making enemies, perhaps I’ll make a friend.

If these nine rules I try to keep and manage to succeed,
Then I will have a simple life by just this little Creed.

And if to these I add one more, to live for Christ each day,
Then time I spend behind these walls, will quickly pass away.

Perspective

Having recently been repatriated after
almost six months of nebulous and
contentious parole, conclude convicts
are a distinct minority enjoying only
tenuous freedom and begrudged toler-
ance (no acceptance) by a discrimi-
hypocritical

nating, and_ vindictive,

majority.
