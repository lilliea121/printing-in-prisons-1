\TION & GOOD TIM

by JOHN L. WILLIAMS, JR.

Recently one of the leading local newspapers
featured an article by Judge Curtis Bok of Common
Pleas Court, Philadelphia, in which he criticized the
outmoded system of sentencing men to the peniten-
tiaries in this State. In his newspaper feature he
outlined a sentencing system that was neither ex-
treme nor lenient, as he considered some of the other
systems in our country to be.

Judge Bok advocated a system based on the
present minimum and maximum sentence with the
difference that the minimum sentence not be rigid.
Included in this sentence would be good time and
incentive time.

With the program of rehabilitation as set up
in our penitentiaries, which includes some of the
most progressive features in penology, the present-
day systems of sentencing a man conflict with
what penologists hope to accomplish with the in-
mates of the penal institutions in our State. My
assignment for this issue had been to contact Judge
Bok and find out what support his system has and
how widely broadeast it was. Also, if anything
definite has been done to have this system introduced
into our legislature. However, at the time [
received my assignment it was brought to my at-
tention that Judge Bok was confined to the hospital.

After conducting an intensive and exclusive
type of interviewing among a large majority of the
men confined at ‘‘Cherry Hill’’, I have quite logi-
eally advanced to the conclusion that everyone in-
terviewed is in complete agreement with Judge Bok
that some kind of a system of receiving good time
on all sentences should be instituted throughout this
State. However, I must point out that the subject
of receiving good time also involves the affiliation
of rehabilitation. As I continue in this article I
will endeavor to emphasize how such a system of
good time would be beneficial to both society and
to prisoners.

To begin with, various judges and the vast
majority of society seem to be of the opinion that
a person convicted of a crime should be given the
maximum sentence as prescribed by law, if the
newspapers have given considerable adverse pub-
licity to that particular individual’s case.

As an illustration of the present sentencing
system, let’s assume that a person receives a
sentence of 10 to 20 years for the charge of Burg-
lary. This person is not eligible for a parole hear-
ing until he has served his complete MINIMUM
sentence of 10 years. The remaining 10 years, which
is his MAXIMUM sentence, is to be served on
parole, providing that he is granted parole at the
expiration of his MINIMUM sentence.

SYSTEM OF GOOD TIME

If a judge at the time of sentencing a defendant
feels that that particular person should be dealt with
severely, he could, for instance, still give the defen-
dant a sentence of 10 to 20 years. But under the good
time system the prisoner would automatically be
interviewed for a parole hearing at 1/3 of his
MINIMUM sentence of 10 years, or 3 years and 4
months. The prisoner would also, under the system
of good time, receive 10 days a month good time
from his entire 20 years sentence. However, when
the prisoner is interviewed for parole at 1/3 of his
MINIMUM sentence, it does not necessarily mean
that he would be granted an immediate parole.
There are many factors the Parole Board would
have to consider in his case. Such as, completely
scrutinizing the prisoner’s institutional record of
his adjustment and behavior; achievements in pris-
on, and various factors pertinent to rehabilitation.
If, after having served 1/3 of his minimum sentence
of 10 years, a prisoner were refused parole, he
would then be eligible for a parole hearing every
year thereafter, until he had either proven himself
rehabilitated, or until he had served a total of 13
years and 4 months of his entire sentence. If he had
not lost any time for violations of the Rules and
Regulations of the institution, then, upon having
served 13 years and 4 months of his 10 to 20 years
sentence, he would automatically be released and
his entire sentence terminated, because the remain-
ing 6 years and 8 months is the amount of good time
he would receive from his entire sentence.

When a prisoner is received at the penitentiary
he is placed in quarantine, and during the first two
or three weeks there he may quite frequently hear
the word rehabilitation. After curiously inquiring of
this particular subject, the prisoner learns that
rehabilitation consists of improving his mental out-
look in respect to terminating all further indulgence
in criminal activity; melioration of his social atti-
tudes and pattern of deportment; learning to accept
and to abide by the rules and regulations which
govern society and the institution in which he is
confined; improvement of his education and ful-
fillment of all Religious obligations, ete.

The prisoner entered the institution with the
impression that he was sent there as punishment,
and being previously confronted with the various
inconsistencies he begins to wonder if it is possible
for him to be punished and rehabilitated at the
identical time.

Now, after being equipped with the full know-
ledge of the ingredients of rehabilitation, its pur-
