“T am written to you two days earlyer this
time than last time. How’s that? O.K., I
hope. How are you? Fine I hope. We are
all fine and hope you are the same. Are
you O.K. I hope so. Youre papa is out of
work again since the last time I wrote to
you, twice already. The first job was a
night watchman job in a whiskey ware-
house yet. 4 days he’s there and he gets
roaring drunk and trips over all the alarm
strings they lay out to catch the crooks. No
offence to you, my dear son, Francis Xavier.
Well, anyway, he got canned and comes
home with a shopping bag full of stuff from
the warehouse he was putting away for a
rainy day. I took outta the bag 7 bottles of
whiskey, 3 haff gallons of musketell, 2 bot-
tles of Rock and Rye, 1 little bottle of bit-
ters, but it tasted lousy, and 15 bottles of
chocklet covered crickets. I sez to papa,
‘how come 15 bottles of chocklet covered
crickets?’ and he sez, ‘b’cause it’s for gore-
mays, that’s why.’ Well, I ate a hole jar all
by myself and they don’t even taste like
crickets. Do they have crickets where youre
at? The sekond job papa had since I wrote
you last was at that big restrant down
town, the CHICKEN GALORE. And he
was a chicken plucker b’cause they only
cooked fresh chickens. One hole week papa
does good and makes $53.67 and then one
day papa wraps one of the haff gallon jugs
of musketell in his coat and takes it in the
chicken plucking room with him. When the
boss comes for the plucked chickens later
on, they ain’t plucked, and papa’s out cold

Fall 1966

the only one of you kids who got to high
school, but she was ex-spelled last week. You
seen how big Pauline was when she came in
with me to visit you at Easter. She’s like a
woman and oi, those big legs. Well, she
comes home with one of those mini skirts
one day; $15.00 it cost, but where she got
the money, who nose. Theyre so short, those
mini skirts. They go all the way up and
Pauline’s got those big legs. And she wears
it to school last week, and I sez... ‘don’t
wear it to the 9th grade, Pauline. It’s too
short and your legs are like a woman’s.’
She sez, ‘it’s my skirt, ma, and I’m wearing
it. So what happens? Don’t that snotty
Inglsh Teecher, Mr. Wortter holler about
the skirt and slap Pauline’s bare leg. And
don’t Pauline jump up and flatten him with
one punch. She’s strong, that Pauline. What
a riot! They had to come and get me at the
factory, and Mr. Sauerwein, my boss, was
mad. He docked me a haff days pay, the
schmiel. Pauline cant go back to school, so
I gess [ll have to get her a job at the fac-
tory. I hope she don’t punch Mr. Sauerwein
if he pinches her legs. Oi, Francis Xavier,
what a lot of troubles we got out here. You
should be glad youre in a place where they
ain’t got no troubles. You remember you
ast me to tell youre old sweetheart, Olga, to
get in touch with you. Well, she’s living
with Bernie Morostrowski now and don’t
wanna do it cause Bernie’s got an awful
temper and hits hard. She sez for you to
give her a brake and don’t make Bernie
mad. But I was telling Mrs. Borazinski a-
bout it; you know her, the lady up the
corner with the anchor tattoed on her arm
and the big Goiter on her neck. Well, she
said her daughter, Stella, wood be happy
to write to you. You remember Stella Bora-
zinski, the fast kid, but she’s a looker. You
gotta admit that. Stella’s got 3 kids now
she never was married. But you cant hold
hold that against her cause she’s a looker,
and you gotta admit that. So I ast her,
‘Stella, wood you like to write to my son,
Francis Xavier, at the Pen?’ and she sez,
‘Wood I?! Youre damn right I wood!’ She
gave me this pitcher of her in a Bikini to
send to you and if you like it you and her
can get together when you get out...’

I let go of mom’s big letter and started to hunt for
Stella in the Bikini. I’m thrashing all over the cell
looking for Stella and I keep bumping into Mom’s
letter. It damn near fills the room, like a parachute.
I don’t see Stella anywhere, and the envelope is
empty. Pm starting to panic now, and I gathers up
