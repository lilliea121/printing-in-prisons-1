THEME and VARIATIONS

Looking back over ten years of music in here,
the thought occured to me to choose from among the
musicians I have known and performed with, those
whom I think would make up a good dance band.
Of course, this is merely my selection and is not that
of other members of the present dance band.

It has been my privilege te swing with some
pretty good cats in Ye Olde Bastile. I can recall
times when all our troubles and personal pressures
seemed to leave us and the music flowed from within
in a powerful stream, and other times when we were
nowhere, man, just nowhere. However, to return to
my selecting what I consider to be the best aggre-
gregation in here over the years, here goes:

Hurst Alto Sax: 2222322 ee ee Bill Pitman.

Second Bo-lenor =. = ae Sherrod

If the readers of this magazine will write down
the names of the musicians whom they think are the
most and give it to Al Rasky, your next Music
Editor, he will publish the results of that poll. Copy
down the above list of instruments and fill in the man
you select for each chair. If you can’t find Al, give
it to Mr. Brown, the Musical Director, and he will
turn it over to Al. All musicians selected must be
either present or former inmates of E. S. P.
