NON-CONFORMIST ?

court-martial, but he draws fifteen days restriction,
with extra training. Anyone that was ever in the
24th Regimental Combat Team in Japan knows what
that is and how it’s administered.

Shortly thereafter, war begins in Korea. The
entire 25th Division is alerted for a combat assign-
ment. Everyone is restricted. All leaves, passes and
furloughs are cancelled. Everyone that knew a way
off the post other than the main gates, used it.
Including yours truly. This was it and we knew it.
Duffle Bag and his brother went together for their
last visit to Naka and Shi-Naka, quite AWOL. So
were we all. I believe this to be one of the few times
that that guy did the least wrong and didn’t get
caught.

He was a man who ecouldn’t or wouldn’t con-
form. Some ealled him no good, others dismissed him
as not being soldier material. Still others said he was
a disgrace to his Regiment, his uniform and the
Colors under which he served. What is my opinion?
I’ll give you the ending and let you decide.

In August of 1950 the Regiment was holding a
section of the Pusan Perimeter west of a small
village named Haman. The 3rd Batallion had fought
its way up ‘‘Old Baldy’”’ to ‘‘Bloody Peak’’. There
they dug in. Casualties were heavy. Mike Company,
the Heavy Weapons Company, had it’s M. G.’s in
a formidable position. If the line could hold, they
could wreak havoe upon the enemy. But after mid-
night, Item, King and Love Companies came under
heavy, savage attack. Love had to give, it couldn’t
hold, which meant it was best to withdraw the
Battalion to save it from being surrounded and cut
off. An orderly withdrawal was ordered under cover

of mortar and artillery fire; but nothing is like
direct cover. A machine gunner refused to leave
his post at his gun. Securing all the ammunition he
could, he prepared to man his gun.

The following day the 8rd Battalion, 24th Reg-
iment with 2nd Battalion, 27th Regiment, assaulted
and recaptured ‘‘Bloody Peak’’. On the summit in
his gun emplacement he lay, terribly battered, bay-
oneted and shot-up, across his heavy 30 caliber M.G.
All of his ammo expended, he used his carbine and
45 until they, too, were empty. He did not die
alone, for scattered all over were the communist
dead, and there were many of them. He prevented
the enemy from pressing its attack; he saved many
a life by giving his own. Yes---,it was ‘‘Dufflle
Bag’s’’ brother. He may have lived to some as a
non-conformist, but to all of us who knew him, he
died as only a real man can.
