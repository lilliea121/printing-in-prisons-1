tide goes out, it just hates to come back; as a result,
the water pressure weakens.

Of course, you realize that we all don’t go “‘stir
bugs’ from this ancient and evil atmosphere, with
its dark, dirty, foreboding corners and maze of
twisted alleys. So what if I wear a “‘Beanie with a
propellor,”’ the alleys can confuse anyone for awhile.
Confusing as a centipede trying to find which knee
has the water on it.

In fact, I know of one fellow who was arrested
for shooting squirrels; he pleaded self-defense and
entered here with five years. He was 22 years of
age at the time. He was paroled when his five years
were completed and he looked like a million—but
he was only 27. | think the alleys did it, see?

Speaking of alleys, reminds me of our Movie Hall
(heh heh). Actually, it’s attic space left over from
the Laundry on the first floor. It’s so small they only
show short subjects. If you are delayed in getting
to the movies, you can get lost in the alleys; you
must enter the Hall bent over, so you won't inter-
fere with the beam from the projection booth. It’s
great fun watching the late arrivals entering bent
ever on tip-toe; they look like guys sneaking out of
church just before the collection—or with the col-
lection. Speaking of church, our visiting room is just
about the size of a confessional box; it’s so small
that even the mice who live there are hump-backed

from lack of space. But then, everyone here has a
problem. Take the teen-agers here, they are forever
stealing the hub caps off the wheel chairs in the hos-
pital. They learn early here from the old timers,
that 2 and 2 are 4; and five will get you ten if you
work it right. As my old cell partner use to say,
“Man who sit on tack—better off.” | remember

when he went to the Captain and complained that
the mice were squeeking in our cell, and the Captain
said, ““‘Whatta ya want me ta do, go in an oil em fer
ya?’ Yeah, he was a good cell partner, only he had
been up the river so often that everyone called him
‘“Showboat.”’ He was a kleptomaniac, and when the
Parole agent got him a job in Baldwin’s Locomotive
Works, he damn near went crazy trying to get out
the gate with a caboose. He’s O.K. now though; he
married, and every morning he has two lumps with
his coffee—his wife and Mother-in-law. He had a
difficult time convincing his wife to quit smoking
cigarettes, but just the other day I heard from him,
and he’s convinced his wife has quit smoking cigar-
ettes at last, because he’s now finding cigar butts
around the house.

But like I say, “It’s a tough station house,’ but
Jonah’s experience with the whale is proof enough
that you can’t keep a good man down. Everybody
can make a comeback. They even dug King Tut up
after 5000 years.

Yes, | maintain ““They’’ should not remove the
Pen. Suppose they do transfer the men in prepara-
tion of demolishing this site. We will probably be
transferred to some “Country Club” as the local
newspapers are wont to say. After inhaling what
passes for fresh air here, I’m sure many of the men
will succumb to the fresh and rarified atmosphere
of some rural area. As things stand here now, you
have to go to the Prison garage to get a breath of
fresh air.

Somehow I lose faith rapidly anymore, with all
this talk about demolishing this old rock pile. Pris-
ons aren’t what they use to be; in fact, | hear the
Warden opens the big front door here every morn-
ing, (now get this) by getting the key from under
the front door mat. So there. (Cont. on Page 27)
