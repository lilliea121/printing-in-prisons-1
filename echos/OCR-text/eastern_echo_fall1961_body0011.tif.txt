The feeble protests before that time should be re-
corded. As early as 1801, the mechanics of New York
protested against the prison competition. Again in
1823, cabinetmakers in the same state protested
against this competition, and in 1828 and 1829, re-
ports to the legislature declared the contract system
to be destructive of good to both the institution and
the prisoner. In 1830, the mechanies of Utica and
Brooklyn complained against unfair competition. In
1842 a secret labor organization called the “Mechan-
ics’ Mutual Protection,’ was formed in Buffalo for
the explicit purpose of combating competitive prison
labor. By 1847 this organization had fifty locals in
New York, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wis-
consin.

This early opposition to convict labor failed to ac-
complish any considerable results because the early
labor organizations did not have enough economic
and political strength. In the period following the
war between the States, however, the Industrial Re-
volution had become thoroughly established in the
United States, creating a much larger industrial pro-
letariat and weakening the position of the merchant-
‘apitalist. The greatly increased laboring class began
to build up its strong national organizations and
eventually became a sufficient power to command the
attention and solicitude of ambitious politicians. The
severe panic and depression of 1875 and the following
years greatly stimulated the activity of labor organ-
izations in behalf of the industrial workers. Their old
enemy, the contract prison labor system, was a spe-
cial object of attack. The early labor organizations
that came into existence during this period, notably
the Knights of Labor, continued their attacks against
the system, and these were strengthened after the
formation of the American Federation of Labor.

Irom 1880 on, organized labor and its political lobby-
ists, agents, and allies kept up the fight until contract
convict labor was altogether abolished.

The great success of organized labor in combating
contract prison labor has been largely due to politi-
cians who have exploited this issue to attract the
labor vote. An example of this is to be found in the
passage of the ill-conceived Muehlbronner Act in
Pennsylvania in 1897, making it illegal for the state
penitentiarics to work more than five per cent of
their inmates in the manufacture of brooms and
brushes, hollow-ware, or ten per cent in the manu-
facture of any other kind of goods, or to use machines
operated by power to make any commodities fabri-
cated elsewhere in the state by free labor. This act
spelt disaster to the prison labor program in Penn-
sylvania. Even in the year 1909, while the contract
system still flourished in our prisons, an investigator

found that of the 2,900 idle able-bodied prisoners in
the entire country, no less than 2,073 where in
Pennsylvania.

The abolition of the contract system was desirable,
but the pendulum swung too far toward state con-
trol and the fatal restriction of prison labor, to the
detriment of the state and the convict and with no
corresponding benefit to free labor. In place of the
abuses of “forcing” labor under the contract system
there has developed a deplorable tendency toward an
expensive and demoralizing idleness.

Aside from the objections of free labor and the
politician to the contract system, the humanitarian
also has a valid criticism. The prison factory has ex-
ploited the prisoner; and according to the philosophy
of the times, he deserved to be exploited, or, at the
least, he needed striet discipline and hard and oner-
ous manual labor for deterrence and reformation.
A few intelligent ex-prisoners exposed the evils of
the system. Kate Richards O’Hara, political prisoner
in the Missouri State Penitentiary, pictured the con-
tract system of prison labor as one of rank exploita-
tion and brutality, motivated only by the greed for
profits at the expense of the helpless convicts. Under
the task method the prison worker was obliged to
measure up to a certain set quota. If he failed in this
he was unmereifully punished on the assumption that
he was malingering. Some sixteen prisons still have
the “task” in a modified form: in some institutions
merely to determine where piece work shall begin;
and in some to indicate when inmates may stop work-
ing for the day.

Inmates were required to maintain strict silence
while working. Such was the Auburn system in ac-
tion during the late years of the nineteenth century.

PROFILE

Professor of Sociology and An-
thropology Negley K. Teeters, a
University faculty member since
1927, is an internationally recog-
nized authority on criminology.

He is the author of 10 books on
criminology and penology. ‘“‘New
Horizons in Criminology,’ which
is now in its third printing, and
“The Challenge of Delinquency,”
written in 1950 with John O. Reine-
mann, are used as text books in over 100 colleges.

In 1944 Dr. Teeters was awarded a grant from the De-
partment of State to make a study of prisons in several
South American countries.

He received his A.B. from Oberlin College in 1920, his
A.M. and Ph.D. from Ohio State University in 1925 and
1931, respectively.
