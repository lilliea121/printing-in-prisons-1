We are, after all, only people ... with problems.

proach to gaining a more ‘“‘favorable press’’ was to
explain ECHO aims and request cooperation of the
newspapers in presenting and furthering them.
Also to be asked, specifically, was that they separate
the individual from the labels ‘‘con’’ and ‘‘ex-con’’
in their reporting, on the theory that the public
could only gain a true picture of prisoners by seeing
them as they exist, individually. Which, naturally,
must result in the recognition that they are, after
all, only people ... with problems.

OTHER HIGHLIGHTS

Changing the conversation, Dr. Teeters observed
that present penal systems were as old-fashioned
Model T Fords fitted out with some new and modern
parts, but the new parts are not enough. Exploding
a current myth, he disclosed that the institution
with fine athletic facilities, good library, clean mod-
ern appointments, with the accent on Instructors
and the teaching of trades... still may be a failure.
Dr. Teeters believes that the sports, libraries and
trades are all good things, but that they can be
overdone. Good in their own way, they can become
mere ‘time-killers,’ pleasant ways of doing time,
but the personal, individual problem of each inmate
can be forgotten. Surprising as it may be, most
trades learned in prisons are not used by the prison-
ers once they are released.. A possible solution, the
professor said, would be to de-emphasize the Instruc-
tors of trades somewhat and put the money and time
into experienced Case Workers. It seems that most
modern Psychologists, Penologists, ete., believe that
at some time during his incarceration an inmate
reaches his highest potential for rehabilitation, and
that if released at this time he would be the best risk
to himself and to society at large. If this ‘‘time’’
passes, without his being released, the prisoner slowly
deteriorates and becomes a menace to himself and to
society. Teeters contended that a trained Case
Worker is best suited to help the man reach that
high peak of awareness as to the cause of his being
in prison, and to weigh the wispy intangibles and
determine that ‘‘time’’ of highest return.

A Staff member asked the Professor what an
inmate could do to help himself while in prison.

HE

IF

Tne! Ehime! Whine
then think some more. Ultimately, you must solve
your own problem ... from within. It is difficult
to think, and easy to alibi, but you must see past the
alibi, identify your problem, and solve it. Treat-
ment staff and facilities are here to serve you...
but you must see the need and you must have the
drive to help yourself and to be helped!”’

Asked about the possibility of other meetings
of this type, Dr. Teeters offered to try to arrange
meetings between student criminologists and varied
groups of inmates. He feels that everyone would
profit. The professor said he would also try to set
up debates between university and inmate teams on
points of mutual interest... but first he would try
to arrange to have some debating experts help es-
tablish debating teams here. He would also look
into the possibilities of a class in journalism.

Speaking about the institution, Dr. Teeters com-
mented on the ‘‘relaxed’’ atmosphere. Of all the
maximum security prisons visited by him, this one
appeared to be the most relaxed. He stated that
the appointment of a Commissioner of Correction
and the creation within this institution of the East-
ern Diagnostic Classification Center, with the mod-
ern regime here, were big steps forward. Hvincing
his interest in the historical aspects of this prison, he
said that he has been coming here for about 27 years
and that this was the first time he was allowed to
talk to the inmates themselves. Thus this meeting
was a minute of history on the historical clock of
the institution. Seen against the backdrop of the
old regime... it would not have happened.

Perhaps the writer was unduly impressed by
the eye-opening meeting, but after years of seeing
the prisoners treated as political pawns, no-caste
citizens, and the targets of anyone with the need of
an unanswering target, it was refreshing indeed to
talk with someone from free society who could see
the prisoner’s side as well as the public’s. The
oddly—illuminating ideas of the famed eriminolo-
gist, his faculty of seeing beyond the usual, and his
advanced theories backed up with logic and vision,
were like a fresh breeze lifting a veil on the old
theories that have failed.

was the reply. ‘‘And

‘On the other hand, if the society can be sufficiently objective and understanding in
not having to burn psychoties as witches or punish offenders as criminals; if the society
can express its aggressions through football, boxing, politics, and TV stories; then the
prison can assume its function of treating the socially ill with the best methods of which

we are aware.’?
