Psychoipgigt, SCIPHA

All of us are probably familiar with the philo-
sophical statement that, ‘‘into every life a little rain
must fall.’’ The popular interpretation of this ab-
stract phrase centers around the idea that every in-
dividual will encounter adversity and tragedy in the
course of his life. A psychologist who, by his train-
ing, is constantly seeking hidden meanings and clues,
would usually be inclined to give a more unique and
detailed interpretation of this phrase. He would state
that feelings of tension, anxiety, and frustration are
a normal part of life in a complex, highly civilized
society. The important consideration is how the in-
dividual perceives, combats, and overcomes these
feelings. By the same token, there are personal trag-
edies and disasters which befall each and every one
of us. How we are able to handle and surmount these
dire experiences is a strong indication of our capacity
for successful living.

In the case of individuals who have manifested
underlying personality disturbances through emo-
tional disorders and/or criminal acts, we can usually
assume that calamitous events have occurred which
they have been unable to handle constructively. Their
traumatic experiences are often so painful that they
must be repressed from the conscious mind. Never-
theless, they are often potent factors in shaping a
person’s behavior.

Many psychologists view criminality as a form of
deviant behavior akin to, if not identical with, mental
illness. In helping an individual to restructure a life
which has been dissipated in crime, a psychologist will
utilize similar techniques and theories to those that
he would apply to a patient whose difficulties clearly
emerged from an emotional disorder with no anti-
social involvements.

He relies on the basic premise that behavior is con-
tinuous and meaningful. Patterns of response which
are established in childhood tend to persist into ado-
lescenee and adult life, unless they are modified by
subsequent experiences. In most cases these patterns
are modified substantially as the individual learns
greater self-control, becomes less self-centered, and
develops a better understanding of himself and
others. When there is a failure in the modification of
these patterns, we say that the individual has not
progressed adequately in his maturation. The anxie-
ties, frustrations, and conflicts which daily confront
a person in our competitive society then prove diffi-
cult and sometimes impossible to mange. Thus, are
the foundations laid for mental illness and eriminal
behavior.

To illustrate these points, the following case his-
tory is presented. The facts are true, only the name
is fictitious. The skeletal features alone are pre-
sented, for to relate the entire case would require
several editions of the Echo. This case history has
been selected because personality patterns are rela-
tively clear-cut, and should pose little difficulty of
understanding.

Nelson Curtis is a 38 year old single male inmate
at the State Correctional Institution at Philadelphia.
He is no stranger to prison, having spent 10 of his
adult years in various correctional institutions. Nel-
son has been convicted of four felonies, and is cur-

rently serving a 24 to 5 year sentence for larceny.

The symptoms of maladjustment are readily dis-
cernible, and are not unusual in a prison population.
Nelson has used alcohol excessively, has been unable
to maintain steady employment, and perhaps most
important of all, he has been unable to establish and
maintain meaningful relationships with other people.

Why did these felonies occur? Was this man just
too lazy to work, and sought an easy way to success
through erime? Did he drink excessively because he
enjoyed the company of the people he met in bars,
or was he trying to blot out the unpleasantness and
disillusionments he had experienced in life? Answers
to these questions are seldom apparent, but with con-
tinued study and search we can usually gain under-
standing of these complex problems.

To the casual observer, Nelson’s home environment
would appear to have been adequate. His father was
employed as a civil administrator, and was able to
provide well for his family. The death of Nelson’s
mother from pneumonia (when he was only 1 year
old) resulted in a situation which profoundly effected
him for the rest of his life. Subsequent to her death,
Nelson went to live with the Maternal Grandparents,
while Jim, his older brother, was placed with the
