With disparity of sentence now so rampant, how-
ever, there is a question whether one is condemned
for the commission of the crime or the lengthy sen-
tence imposed as a penalty. Crime is not a way of
life nor an avocation. It can perhaps best be described
aS an onerous means to an onerous end. Other than
the buecaneers and privateers, who were actually
licensed pillagers, it would be contentious to state
another individual visualized a life of crime as a rich
and rewarding experience.

When branding another a criminal it is well to
remember it is a tragic indictment of any economic
system where we find men bred to toil, willing to toil
yet when unable to find it all too often as a result end
up in a prison cell. Equally ironic, and unjust though
it may be, in too many instances, the rungs of the
social ladder are the scales used to weigh justicee—the
lower rung the higher the penalty. In fact, it is fast
becoming proverbial that justice, or at least punish-
ment, travels with greater celerity when dealing with
the poor and neglected than when concerned with the
wealthy and influential.

It is only when one studies the question of punish-
ment meted out by the courts that widespread dispar-
ity of sentence and punishment becomes apparent.
When an excessive or lengthy sentence is imposed
and unduly publicized the majority of those reading
of such fate conclude the one so sentenced to be be-
yond redemption. Had a moderate sentence resulted
the conclusions, in all probability, would have been
otherwise and hope would have prevailed for the de-
fendant as well as by him.

As long as a lack of uniformity of sentence and
punishment is permitted the cause of rehabilitation is
lost for all practical purposes and prisons must re-
main the scourge of humanity. When the individual
or board is vested with arbitrary powers what usual-
ly follows, with inequitable consistency, is an abuse
of discretion. The callous abuse of discretionary
powers can be curbed only with the enactment of
uniform laws governing the dispensing of justice
without partiality. The publicity seeking jurist who
‘‘who hits the defendant with the book’’ has served
little, if anything, other than his own questionable
ends.

If the purpose of imprisonment is rehabilitation
and/or punishment both objectives could and should
be achieved within a reasonable length of time. Ex-
cessive or lengthy terms of imprisonment so disparate
as to be self-defeating, even if purposeful, serve
neither justice nor humanity.

The lot of one condemned to a lengthy term of im-
prisonment is not a eredit to modern civilization.
Such a fate is as difficult to portray with words as it
is to visualize without the actual experience. It is but
a crude degenerative process that eventually reduces
its victim to a dehumanized state of being void of all
his Creator willed.

As the leaves from the calendar fall so too do the
hopes for release by the long term prisoner short of
that time when his physical resources still remain in-
tact. Those who have served 20-25-30 or more years
have inescapably been soured by the march of time

against time. The only change in their days comes
with the weather as they kill time which in the end
kills them. As they slowly vegctate through the years
they become conscious of their physical deterioration
yet seemingly show little awareness of the mental
erosion that comes with long years of debilitating
confinement. It is as though, caught up on the horns
of a moral dilemma, they are forced to parry the
consequences.

When the long termer’s years adds up to decades
he becomes but a relic of a past to whom all blessings
have long since ceased to flow. In effect, he can be
likened to one of the Grapes of Wrath turned sour
by an over-extended stay on the dry gallows which
lengthens rather than shortens his existence. With
both feet anchored in oblivion his spirit must remain
horizontal as automatism actuates his will without
conscious violition as he plods through the years void
of life as the phrase implies.

While viewing death with a certain degree of hope,
these victims of disparity tend to shun the opening
of the vein although aware one cannot be hurt falling
from bed when sleeping on the floor.

In all prisons the three ‘R’s’ hold sway consisting
of rules regulations and regulations regulating regu-
lations and rules and these the long termer learns
early by rote. When nearing the end of his first dee-
ade the impenetrable viewpoint of the Gods of Fate
no longer mystify him. At the end of his second dece-
ade he is no longer the same individual he was a score
of years earlier for there remains not as much as ¢
single cell in his body unchanged by time. While his
horizons have been physically limited his fields of
interest have lessened perceptively from loss of pro-
gressive contacts. His generation having gone the

ray of all flesh, the friends and acquaintances of yes-
teryear have ceased to be; the fairweather becoming
early casualties.

In later years newspapers became available and
through them he partially frees himself from his eul-
tural ghetto only to learn that erime, to an unwhole-
some extent, has become glorified by mass news media
—the world’s most authoritative university. The
changes wrought by time and man’s efforts, he learns,
are miraculous. The atomic age has arrived. The
nation’s population has increased some 60 odd mil-
lion. The 11 million unemployed of the depression—
prohibition era of his day has since been absorbed in
the 67 million now employed. The dollar has been
stabilized, the banks and financial institutions steril-
ized while the wave of suicides, loss of homes and
property of the pre-bank holiday fiasco seemingly has
been forgotten. Then the pen was mightier than the
sword.

From the press he learns of penal statistics pur-
porting to show 98% of those imprisoned are event-
ually released. In turn he estimates the number of
those who lost their struggle in the inner recesses of
their minds and were committed to mental hospitals.
Then there were those claimed by the Grim Reaper;
still the figure remains constant. It is not broken
down showing what percent of those released were
