Having reached the saturation
point—the point in prison life that
experts state is the opportune time
for release—the prisoner applies for
commutation.

This is the beginning of an action
that will take almost four months be-

the petitioner.

Three favorable of four possible
votes are required before a recom-

application submitted until a good part of the sentence imposed by the court
has been served. This is not because the applicant is ignoring the minimum sen-
tence of the court as it has been made to appear, but in most cases, because the
petitioner has found himself. He feels that he has reached the saturation point
—the point in prison life that experts have been quoted as stating is the oppor-
tune time for release. Unfortunately the theory has not been tried.

The public is so poorly informed about the truth of just what a prisoner
has to do in preparation for the hearing before the Board of Pardons, I think
it will be surprised that so many have the courage to try it. Only a man who
feels that he is ready for release will be eager to submit to the tests that he will
be required to undergo. He must make three or four written tests, one of which
contains about four hundred and fifty questions, which when evaluated offer
quite a bit of information about the inmate. He must be interviewed by the psy-
chologist; he will also be interviewed by the institutional staff board; his block
officer will submit a report that covers his general attitude, personal habits, and
conduct; he will be examined by the Medical Director of the institution. All
such data will be compiled for a final analysis and sent to the Superintendent of
the institution, who will treat the report as he sees fit. This is the beginning of
an action that will take almost four months before the results of the actual hear-
ing are made known to the petitioner.

In comparison to the opposition, the petitioner has next to nothing going
for him except the moral support and prayers of his family. If he has the funds,
and in many cases the family has to borrow the money, he can engage an attor-
ney to represent him at the hearing before the Board.

If he has no funds, a friend may appear on his behalf. If he has neither
friends nor money, he may request the Director of Parole to represent him at
the proceedings.

The other side of the case has an entirely different complexion. The sec-
retary of the Board of Pardons will send copies of the application to the follow-
ing: the Judge who passed the sentence; the District Attorney who prosecuted
the case; the institution in which the petitioner is confined; and the Pennsylva-
nia Board of Parole for it’s investigation. In addition, an invitation is offered
to anyone having any information that will be helpful to the Board in their final
decision, and a written protest may be filed against the petitioner by any citizen.

Now, I would say that the aforementioned is a very formidable array of
talent well qualified to inform the Board of their attitude toward the petitioner’s
plea for clemency. An attitude which is, more often than not, hostile toward the
appellant, which may be a natural result of their other duties which are to send
and keep men in prison, not to be concerned about their plea for clemency. But
even that is not the end of the story.

We come now to the honorable members of the Board of Pardons, each of
whom are unquestionably qualified to evaluate the information presented to
them on behalf of the Commonwealth. Three of the four possible votes are re-
quired in favor of the petitioner before the Board will make a recommendation
of commutation of sentence to the Governor. The Governor, being the Chief
Executive of the Commonwealth, has the power to accept or reject the recom-
mendation of the Board.

It seems to me that the success of any correctional system, or agency of
clemency, can best be measured by the amount of men they help to be re-
leased. From a negative point of view, no correctional system, nor any agency
of clemency is necessary to keep a man in jail. He is already there.

To offset a general misconception that has been inculeated into the minds
of the public, I think it would be appropriate at this time to point out that the
Board of Pardons was not created BY the people in prison, but FOR the people
in prison. It was created by a duly elected Legislature which gave it the power
to recommend Pardons and Commutations, as well as to refuse them. If the only
function of the Board was to refuse all the applications it received, I feel cer-
tain that the members of the Board could find a better use for their time.

These then, are my views on the subject of commutations of sentences.
I leave it up to the reader to decide if a man seeking clemency from the Board
of Pardons has an easy road to travel. Does the Board of Pardons coddle pris-
oners? The next time you see that in the newspapers just sit back and have a
good laugh; it was probably intended as a joke in the first place. —THE END
