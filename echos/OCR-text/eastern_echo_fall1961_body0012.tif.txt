The early prison administrators little realized that
in using the contract labor system they had been a
party to the development of a monster that strangled
the convict and prison alike. John Howard had be-
lieved in labor for prisoners but he was not only op-
posed to exploitation but believed “that there i is’ a
great error in expecting that a (prison) should
be made to maintain itself since with the strict-
est economy, a considerable annual sum will be
found necessary for its proper support.” In
order to make up for thé inefficiency which
characterized the prison factory, due to its’ na-
ture of forced labor, workers had to. be pushed
and exploited. ...

But some of the carly prison administrators
saw the dangers and abuses of the system after
they had seen it-in operation for some time.
Amos Pilsbury, Warden of the Wethersleld,
Connecticut, Prison had praised the prison fae-
tory, but he changed his mind and regretted
“that he had ever paid into the public treasury
the earnings of prisoners instead of using the
surplus funds for the prisoners benefit.”

THE LEASE SYSTEM

Another variation of the contract system, one
even more vicious, was the lease system. Under
it the contractors assumed entire control of the
prisoners, including their maintenance and dis-
cipline, subject, of course, to the regulations
fixed by statute. The convicts were removed
from the prisons and employed in such outdoor
labor as quarrying, agriculture, bridge and
road construction, and turpentine camps. This
form of convict labor approached peonage if not
slavery:

The American public had an opportunity in recent
years to learn of this system by reading that best
seller, Gone With The Wind. It tells of a sawmill
operated by leased convicts under the direct control
of a supervisor hired by Scarlet O’Hara, whose bus-
iness was to make money at any cost. We get the
picture of the cruelties of this system from many re-
ports of the chain gang and its operation, especially
in the South. :

As Dr. Louis Robinson so aptly puts it: “Leasing
is undoubtedly the easiest way out for a state or local
unit of government that does not wish to wrestle with
the problem of caring for its prisoners, particularly
the very difficult task of finding employment for

Kentucky was probably the first state to resort to
the leasing system. McKelvey records that in. 1825,
Joel Scott, a merchant, offered $1,000 a:year for the

labor of the Kentucky convicts for a period of five
years. In California the practice of leasing was re-
sorted ‘to in the gold rush days after ’49., The Vigi-
lance Committee disposed of the worst offenders in
this lawless community, but the lesser lawbreakers
were. a problem—until a state senator agreed to re-

strain them if the state gave him a contract to em-

ploy them. He’ sublet the contract to a man named
McCauley, who housed the convicts on an abandoned

barge anchored in San Francisco Bay and put them
to various tasks on shore. One day the old hulk broke
loose in a gale, drifted to Point San Quentin, ran
aground and broke up. McCauley then worked the
convicts on shore at Point San Quentin making bricks
from clay found there. He built barracks on the
Point, and eventually the State Oi California took
over the prison. Thus San Quentin came. into exist-
ence in the year 1852. Today it is one of the largest
prisons in the ae housing s some 5,000 men.

As leasing beeame more widespread, some states
passed laws turning the convicts over to the counties,
and avoiding the maintenance of a state penal insti-
tution. The system of leasing convicts to private con-
tractors has now been abolished i in almost every state
in the Union.
