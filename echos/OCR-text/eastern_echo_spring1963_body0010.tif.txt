an illicit profit in their right to prescribe addictive
drugs.

Between the two extremes of the Federal Bureau
of Narcotics and the proponents of the British sys-
tem, a growing number of people—doctors, lawyers,
social workers and the clergy—with practical ex-
perience in trying to help addicts, are groping first
toward a better understanding of the problem and
secondly toward better methods of treatment and
rehabilitation. These people see the addict as a sick
person with a deep-rooted personality disorder.
While there is no clinical stereotype which fits all
addicts, psychiatrists have detected a few general
characteristics among them. For example, addicts
are usually impatient people with a low tolerance
for pain of any kind. They want gratification or re-
lief immediately. They also seem to have a tremen-
dous sense of emptiness and inadequacy—-socially,
economically and sexually—an almost total lack of
self-esteem joined with dependent, passive and easily
frustrated temperaments. Though o ft en sensitive
and above average in intelligence, they have the
emotional maturity of a child. In prison, they in-
variably fall prey to the whims and illicit desires of
other inmates. Many of them start using drugs be-
cause they cannot face the challenges, pressures and
turmoil of adult life in society. Heroin neutralizes
the addict’s sense of inadequacy by lifting him out
of the conflicts and troubles of everyday life. It
eliminates his depression, gives him confidence and
also a fantasy life in which he feels that he is impor-
tant. And while it doesn’t make him impotent, her-
oin depresses the addict’s sexual desires to the point
where he is no longer interested in a normal sex life
For the addict, narcotics are a way out of a life that
seems meaningless and fraught with tension, pain
and despair. In prison, even though he has “kicked”
the habit, the addict is invariably the source of con-
siderable trouble. Whether it be a major riot, up-
rising, or common flare-up, the source of the conflict
can be generally traced to the population's addicts.
The idea that the addict, or “‘junkie,”’ as he is called,
is suffering only a pharmacological bondage to her-
oin and that he would stop using it if he were simply
given medical help is for the most part wishful think-
ing. It seems clear from present “‘research’’ that the
addict uses drugs because he likes the way they make
him feel.

Nobody knows exactly how many drug addicts
there are in the United States. Estimates range from
50,000 to 100,000 known addicts; and perhaps
there are an additional 100,000 undetected or un-
reported by the police. Addiction is concentrated in
large industrial areas like Chicago, Detroit, New

York, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia, with a larger

percent of the total in New York than anywhere else.
It is roughly estimated that 80 percent are men be-
tween 18 and 35 years old. The vast majority, per-
haps as high as 90 percent, use heroin, a white, odor-
less crystalline powder manufactured from the waste
matter of morphine, a derivitive of opium. Heroin
may be taken subcutaneously or intravenously; it
may be sniffed like snuff or even rubbed into the
gums. Although some people have been known to
take heroin and not become addicted to it, most of
those who use it become addicts, in a relatively short
time. Whereas addiction to alcohol may take years,
narcotics addiction takes only a matter of weeks or
months; some become “hooked on horse’’ within a
single day. As his system builds up a tolerance for
heroin, the addict must take increasing amounts to
get the same sensation of euphoria, which some ad-
dicts have likened to the same feeling experienced
in a sexual orgasm for some people; or, for others,
a religious ecstasy.

Heroin can be traced to the 19th century, when
it was developed by a German doctor as an antidote
to morphine addiction. When it became apparent
that the cure was worse than the sickness, heroin was
no longer used medically. It is still manufactured,
however, in countries abounding with poppy fields
—Turkey, Thailand, and Mexico. It is neither manu-
factured nor legally imported into the United States.
The illegal traffic in heroin, however, is a multi-
million dollar annual American racket. For example,
a pound of heroin may cost from $500 to $1000
when purchased at the original source. By the time
it is diluted—with baby powder or cocoa and qui-
nine—by sellers or “‘pushers’’ here, the price soars
to some $400,000 a pound. A single shot of “‘horse”’
diluted and rediluted as it passes from hand to hand
——pusher to pusher—costs an addict about $5. The
addict usually needs about two shots a day, not to
stay ‘high,’ but merely to ward off withdrawal sick-
ness—running eyes, ears, nose, muscular pains, dizzi-
ness, vomiting, diarrhea, and in some cases, convul-
sions. In nearly all cases, the suffering is extremely
real and acute. A few addicts report a daily cost of
$170 to maintain their habits, but the average is $20
to $30 a day. Although some addicts are able to
earn enough legitimately to support their habits,
most are not. Some turn to crime almost immediate-
ly, while others begin by victimizing their own fami-
lies. Once he is “hooked,” the “‘junkie’’ has passed
the stage where “‘horse’’ was a luxury or an indul-
gence. He needs it and to get it he will sell his ever-
lasting soul to the devil for a “‘fix.’’ When the fami-
ly’s patience or money runs out the addict may leave
or be put out. From then on he will resort to burg-
lary, picking pockets, shoplifting, (Cont. on Page 27)
