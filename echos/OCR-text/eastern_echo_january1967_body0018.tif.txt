Sometimes Even Shadows Fade

I had been watching the small circling plane
with intense interest for several minutes, ever since
I first heard the oncoming hum of the engine. I was
naturally quite interested, as there aren’t many signs
of modern mechanism in this remote spot, far from
civilization. | knew for a fact that I was sixty-three
miles from the nearest town, and well over two
hundred miles from the closest airfield. I had been
living out here in the Northwest wilderness for al-
most three years and hadn’t seen one other human
being in all that time.

Up until four years ago, mine was a pretty nor-
mal, run-of-the-mill life. But then, personal trage-
dies hammered me with relentless regularity. It
started with the loss of Uncle Henry and Aunt
Clara, my only living relatives, and two very won-
derful people. They were killed instantly when a
tractor-trailer truck jack-knifed at full speed, flipped
over the highway divide from the opposite lane, and
crushed their sedan like an eggshell. Then a few
months later, dear, sweet Beverly, my lovely, faith-
ful fiancee and steady girl from high school and
college days, shattered our engagement by eloping
with a guy from one of those traveling automobile
daredevil shows. And, finally, to top it all off, the
long awaited for promotion I had earned and was
expecting from the advertising agency where | had
worked, was handed over to the freshly kicked out
of college, nephew of one of the fat, rich stock-
holders and directors.

That did it for me! I rented out the house and
the other properties Uncle Henry had left me, and
put everything of value in storage. I bought a good
size, used panel truck and generously stocked it
with everything I thought I would need. Then, with-
out any fanfare, | gave the madcap, phony society
I lived in a last, long, disgusting look and took off
with Bo, my large multi-breed dog.

My only plan was to get away from it all, and
I just kept going until cities and towns dwindled into

hamlets and villages. The villages trickled into an
occasional scattering of buildings. Leaving the high-
ways to travel the back tar roads, we cut off onto
the dirt roads and rutted lanes; then to the rocky
hills and patches of forest. And finally, after bucking
and lurching, and slowly climbing to the high coun-
try, the panel truck broke down completely. We had
made an incredible journey and came to a stop not
far from the Shan-gri-la which was to become my
home.

The natural beauty of the place was so stun-
ning, that it actually appeared to be the rich fabrica-
tion of a Hollywood setting. The clear, wide stream
with the small cataract forming a large, sparkling
pool was charming. The sturdy elegance of the
cedars, hemlocks, giant redwoods, pines and great
oaks, were majestic. And all this regal splendor was
surrounded by and intermingled with wildflowers,
laurel, fern, blueberry and blackberry bushes, and
small wild cherry trees. Everything was clean and
natural, and unspoiled. The heady, untainted at-
mosphere gave me the momentary feeling that I
was desecrating a Godly place by just being there.
I was an intruder!

Nevertheless, slowly but surely, I built my
eighteen by twenty foot cabin about fifty yards
from the crystaline pool, and made use of the wind-
shield and the glass from the sides and back of the
truck for cabin windows. This crude but welcome
architecture gave me a well lighted cabin, but even
more so, an indescribable wildlife view. The morn-
ing scenes of the animals at the pool were breath-
taking, giving me an early assurance of the peace-
ful tranquillity | was seeking.

All around me was an unlimited supply of
trout and game, fresh water and berries. And with
the thriving, small vegetable garden I had planted
each spring, from the seeds I brought along with me,
and the moderate use of my ample store of staples,
Bo and I| were well set and enjoyed feast after splen-

did feast.

My stone and clay fireplace was erected at the
back wall of the cabin, with a small oven to one side
and an iron grill on the other side. The sturdy table,
chairs and bunk were made of cedar, and | even
