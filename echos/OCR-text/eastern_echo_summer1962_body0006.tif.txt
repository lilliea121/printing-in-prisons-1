REHABILITATION
GOOD TIME

Recently one of the leading local newspapers
featured an article by Judge Curtis Bok of Common
Pleas Court, Philadelphia, in which he criticized the
outmoded system of sentencing men to the peniten-
tiaries in this State. In his newspaper feature he
outlined a sentencing system that was neither ex-
treme nor lenient, as he considered some of the other

systems in our country to be.

Judge Bok advocated a system based on the
present minimum and maximum sentence with the
difference that the minimum sentence not be rigid.
Included in this sentence would be good time and
incentive time.

With the program of rehabilitation as set up
in our penitentiaries, which includes some of the
most progressive features in penology, the present-
day system of sentencing a man conflict with what
penologists hope to accomplish with the inmates of
the penal institutions in our State. My assignment
for this issue had been to contact Judge Bok and find
out what support his system has and how widely
broadcast it was. Also, if anything definite has
been done to have this system introduced into our
legislature. However, at the time I received my
assignment it was brought to my attention that Judge
Bok was confined to the hospital.

After conducting an intensive and exclusive
type of interviewing among a large majority of the
men confined at ‘“‘Cherry Hill’, I have quite logi-
cally advanced to the conclusion that everyone in-
terviewed is in complete agreement with Judge Bok
that some kind of system of receiving good time
on all sentences should be instituted throughout this
State. However, | must point out that the subject
of receiving good time also involves the affiliation

of rehabilitation. As | continue in this article |
will endeavor to emphasize how such a system of
good time would be beneficial to both society and
to prisoners.

To begin with, various judges and the vast
majority of society seem to be of the opinion that a
person convicted of a crime should be given the
maximum sentence as prescribed by law, if the news-
papers have given considerable adverse publicity to
that particular individual's case.

As an illustration of the present sentencing
system, let's assume that a person receives a sentence
of 10 to 20 years for the charge of Burglary. This
person is not eligible for a parole hearing until he has
served his complete MINIMUM sentence of 10 years.
The remaining 10 years, which is his MAXIMUM
sentence, is to be served on parole, providing that he
is granted parole at the expiration of his MINIMUM
sentence.

SYSTEM OF GOOD TIME

If a judge at the time of sentenciag a defendant
feels that that particular person should be dealt with
severely, he could, for instance, still give the defen-

months.

dant a sentence of 10 to 20 years.

The prisoner would also, under the system
of good time, receive 10 days a month good time
from his entire 20 years sentence. However, when
the prisoner is interviewed for parole at | /3 of his
MINIMUM sentence, it does not necessarily mean
that he would be granted an immediate farole.
There are many factors the Parole Board would have

to consider in his case. Such as, completely scrut-
