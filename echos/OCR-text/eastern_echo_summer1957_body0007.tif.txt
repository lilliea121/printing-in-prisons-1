The Point System would allow for consideration of the prisoner as an individual

Upon reception at the Diagnostic Center, John
Doe undergoes extensive examining in preparation
for evaluating him as an individual. He faces a
team of experts versed in the disciplines of psychol-
ogy, psychiatry, medicine, education, religion, sociol-
ogy and vocational guidance. He is exhaustively
tested, observed, interviewed and counseled with all
data gathered and compiled, and evaluated by mem-
bers of the Diagnostic Board. When a thorough and
objective evaluation of John has been made, the
Board calls him before them. And here it is where
the very structure of the sentence allows for con-
siderations of John as a person.

Let us suppose, in the theoretical case at hand,
that the Director of the Diagnostic Center is address-
ing John at his classification. ‘“‘John, this is the
picture of you that your period of examination and
analysis presents to the Board. We have gone over
each facet of the testing with you, you have had all
your questions answered regarding the results. One
of our Case Workers has followed you throughout
your entire three month period of evaluation. He
has consulted with you and directly with your fam-
ily, friends, associates and former employer, in order
to gain further insight into the social situations
which helped mold you, which affected your develop-
ment, and in which you found yourself at the time
of committing your offense. As I say, taking all
these things together, we have been able to learn a
good bit about you. Your cooperation with us has
helped to make the following judgment:

“Tt being the sentence of the court that you
accumulate 1,200 points, with 600 required for pa-
role, the Board has determined the manner in which
you ean best and most quickly earn your conditional
release ... or parole. Because you have not exhib-
ited any previous criminal tendencies or behavior;
because as a married man you fulfilled all obligations
and duties to support your wife and children; be-
cause your total characteristics do not indicate or
predict any marked deviations; because there 1S
much hope of returning you as an asset to society,
and because of many other favorable factors, the
Board hereby determines that you are to receive 300
points toward your goal of accumulation. Wns
means that before parole is granted in your case,
you must earn 300 additional points.

‘“‘Of course, the law provides that had your
picture warranted we could have allowed you the
entire 600 necessary for release—or, on the other
hand, none at all. I think you will agree, in view
of the work you must yet do with yourself, that 300
is fair to you.

‘How you accumulate your 300 points is largely
up to you. The law assures you a minimum of 5

EASTERN EcHo

points per each month time served, which means
that if you do no more for yourself than simply
“serve your time,’’ it will take you 5 years to bring
the required 800 points. On the other hand, we
have told you where we believe you are deficient
and in need of help. So with that 5 points per
month, you may also earn 2 points for attending
counselling sessions, with continued progress, to
diseuss cure of the problems underlying your al-
coholism; an additional point per month for comple-
tion of your last year of high school which we see
lacking in your scholastic achievement; and another
2 points per month (good time) which under a flex-
ible law may be allowed. Thus, the 5 points coupled
to the 5 achievement points allow you to collect up
to 10 points per month.

‘You will be transferred from the Center to a
medium security prison some time next week.
When you arrive there, your file will be in the hands
of the Director of Treatment.

‘‘Now John, remember that any points given to
you for favorable attitudes and performance, or any
that you may receive, with the sole exception of the
5 point minimum per month... may be lost by you
when in the opinion of the staff your conduct or
attitudes become unfavorable.’’

Assuming inmate John Doe successfully earned
his 300 points necessary for parole, let us follow the
point system in this theoretical case through parole.

John has been out 3 months and up to now has
apparently been making satisfactory adjustments
in free society. However, he is discovered to be
drinking excessively, and is picked up. Instead of
bringing John back to the penitentiary for anywhere
from 15 months to 5 years, his Parole Officer instead
places John in either his County Prison or one of the
local precinct stations where he remains for one
week, at the end of which both his Parole Officer
and one of the Diagnostic Center’s Case Workers
come to interview him. The Parole Officer presents
his outlook on John’s behavior and John presents
his reasons to the Case Worker. Since John has
been on parole 3 months and has been accumulating
10 points per month, he now has a total of 630 points
to his eredit. The Case Worker rules that John
must lose 30 points because of his drinking: hence,
John has an additional 3 months to make up. He is
still on parole—because he still has 600 points—but
suppose that several weeks later he is picked up
intoxicated and spending freely in a night club.
Again he is locked up a week, at the end of which
he, his Parole Officer and the Case worker again
meet. They question the source of his ‘‘spree mon-
ey,’’ and decide that even if legitimately gained,
