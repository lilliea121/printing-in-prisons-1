With the 1963 season upon us the
Falcons, who are pushing the Mustangs
for first place honors, suddenly find
themselves in a little trouble. They
have just lost two good players in Son-
ny Mays and Curley Heath. The Fal-
cons have acquired several new players
but their sting seems to have vanished
at least for the time being. King “No
No” is having a little trouble and is
serving up some luscious base hits as of
late. It seems that he has been throw-
ing many more pitches to each batter
than he normally does. Knowing “No
No’’ and being a player on the same
team with him during 1962 I know that
this is only a temporary slump and he
will come out of it with flying colors.
This is a team and they never say die
and will be in there fighting until the
last out is made. The Falcons have
signed up some great hitters for this
season in the persons of Lou McCloud,
“Chief’’ Custalow and Jesse Murphy.
Chief and Lou have teamed up with the
fleet footed Griffin and “‘Pigmeat,’’ the
only hold over from last years champi-
onship team, to give the Falcons the
best outfield in the league. “‘No No”
pitched two shut-outs during the first
two weeks of the season and achieved
an even greater performance and that
was throwing a No-Hitter against the
very same Dodgers who shut out the
Falcons in a previous game. Since
that no-hitter he has been weakening.
John Gilmore, the fiery coach of the
Falcons, who kept the players hustling
at all times, has been unanimously
voted on by the owners and Managers
of the four teams to be an umpire. This
will be a big help to all concerned.
Good luck John and | know you will
give all of us a good job.

The Mustangs startled the entire
league by knocking off the opposition
to gain a 10-0 record, at the outset of
the young season including two straight
wins from the highly touted Falcons.
Their first loss came from these same
Falcons beginning the second time
around. It’s a fact the Mustangs have
the two best pitchers in the league in
Kalvitis and Massanova. They are both
fastball pitchers. Massanova depends
mostly on his speed wherein Kalvitis
has good breaking stuff along with a
tantalizing curve ball that can make
you break your back if you aren’t care-
ful. Ronnie Werner a gifted athlete is
a once in a lifetime type that enters a
game. He is one of the best lead-off
men that has been around here for a
long time. He can kill you with his
bunts, because he has tremendous
speed and furthermore can also hit the
long ball. Whenever this fellow gets
as far as first base it’s just like getting
a triple because, before you know it, he
is standing on third waiting to be
scored. When Tommy Griffin was
playing with the Mustangs this was
their one-two punch, and believe me, it
was some punch. Werner is the only
player that I know of in this young sea-
son that has already played every posi-
tion in the infield and is also their
catcher. He gobbles up ground balls
with ease and throws like a 30-30 rifle
and yet he does most of the teams
catching. It is my opinion that with
his tools and credentials he should not
be behind the plate—for this position
could hamper him in movement and
throwing. This fellow only weighs
about 140 pounds and when you have
some 200 pounder running full speed
trying to score and a play is being made
on him something’s gotta give—and |
know it’s not going to be the big fellow.
He is much to valuable to the team
playing elsewhere than a catcher. At
this stage of the season this young fel-
low is leading the league in hitting with
a .431 Batting Average. Good Luck
Ronnie and take care of those bruises.
It is good to see that Bob Gerlach has
recovered from his recent attack of
Blood Poisoning. This team has a good
infield all the way around. Since Cow-
boy joined the team he has been hitting

very well, Chuck Taylor and Paul Bar-
ringer complete the infield. Both Frank
Rouse, their wonderful owner, and Art
their playing manager know it takes all
out hustle to win ball games and before
this season is over the Mustangs may
out hustle everyone and win the pen-
nant. Their present standing is 14-2.
The two defeats came from the Falcons

and Dodgers. Good luck Boys.

The Braves got off to a very poor
start this season because they lost most
of their team from the 1962 season.
But as most of the fellows around here
know, leave it to Ernie and Hayman
and they will come up with something
sooner or later. They had to start
from almost scratch to build this team
and from what has been happening the
last couple of weeks they could very
easily finish the first half out of the cel-
lar. Their pitching staff consists of
Sammy Snyder, Nick and Rupert.
Sammy has been carrying most of the
load and hasn’t been doing too bad at
all. Rupert is a timid sort of a fellow
who doesn’t say much on the mound
while he is pitching but he can cut
down the opposition—ask the Falcons
—he has beaten them twice in two
week. Nick pitched in the Mexican
league in 1962 and decided it was time
to make the jump to the senior loop.
He has good speed but his control is off.
Hayman has spent hours with this fel-
low working with him on control and
it is beginning to show. Nick is gradu-
ally gaining his control and when he
does he will be tough to beat because
with his fast ball he keeps the batters
on edge. Bob Johnson has lost his hat
for not hitting. From all reports he is
having one of his worst years at first
base. He must be getting old. This is
a good young ball club with plenty of
speed. They have tremenduous hitting
power in Frank Smith, Big Mack, Bob
Johnson and John Walker. The speed-
sters also hit well but it is the all around
team play that wins games. The more
they play they'll “right’’ themselves and
eventually stand the strain of the game.
One of the younger players Murray
Dickerson is the most improved player
