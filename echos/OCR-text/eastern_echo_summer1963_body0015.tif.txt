effort goes a long way in winning any battle. Per-
haps higher authority has erred in overlooking these
fellows. To err is human — but generally, a much

better excuse is demanded of us.

Old age and its associated ailments are major
handicaps in an institution of this kind and size. It
is vitally necessary to have the proper facilities for
the care and rehabilitation of the aged and infirm.
Until something more definite is available for these
men to gauge what the future holds for them, a very
moderate degree of optimism should be the order of
the day.

At the present time, 9 Block is the designated
area for the housing of 45 of these inmates, 39 of
whom are either aged, infirmed or both. This “Block
of Ages’ is made more comfortable to some extent,
by a lesser degree of the difficulties, complications
and perplexities of the every day general prison rou-
WINE.

The Bloch of Hfges

by Francis A. Murphy

We are not inclined to think of a penitentiary
inmate as a physically handicapped person, however,
few of us realize that most of us are handicapped to
some degree. In this particular instance, | am mak-
ing particular reference to those inmates who have
had the misfortune to have lost the use of an arm,
leg, vision, hearing, voice or some other part of their

bodies or minds, and/or the aged.

A handicap causes a certain degree of limita-
tion. But within the limitations of each handicap-
ped person there remains a usefulness and produc-
tivity that can be utilized if he is given the guidance
and opportunity. The extent of a handicap is deter-
mined by the degree of disability, and the individ-
ual’s capacity for self-adjustment under the proper
care. Because a man is on crutches or in a wheel
chair is no reason to ignore the ability he has in his
head. What handicapped people lack in their abi!-
ity to walk or stand up, they more than make up for
in manual dexterity, mental activity and general
crafts and_ skills.

are quick to catch the enthusiasm and humor of the
younger fellows who are assigned to the block as
workers. Most of these old boys are sports enthu-

many and varied subjects that come up for debate
