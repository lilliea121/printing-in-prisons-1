The men in prison are aware of the humanistic
emotions governing their lives. The persons who ex-
erecise these powers are just as subject to emotions
that can sway their sound and rightful judgements.
Yet, the long-timers can only hope, pray, and keep
on striving to prove “they are not the men today that
their crime labeled them to be yesterday.”

Throughout the penal world there are minorities
who truly do not warrant consideration on society’s
part. All too often their recidivistic actions are felt
through condemnation of prisoners as a whole. Men
in prison striving mentally and physically to become
decent individuals see their hopes soar away. We
realize that one individual’s actions should not be a
determining factor for all. Yet, this is not so, for the
notoriety heralded is an influencing aspect in veering
intelligent minds from logical reasoning.

In a society that advocates both rehabilitation and
lengthy minimum sentences, a commutation board is
an absolute necessity. Were it not for this fact, a
man with a minimum sentence exceeding his life span
would be in the position of building bridges in space
—the bridge in this instance representing an effort
to show society that men do change when given the
opportunity.

The majority of long termers wish to show that
they are trying to build the foundation for a new life
upon release. The Pardon Board is also aware of this,

but the public, in its ignorance of the facts, often
castigates the board. And in doing so, exhibits
moronic judgement. It is this same public who
affirmed the selection of the members, with a firm be-

INJUSTICE SEEN IN SENTENCES

The Spokesman-Review, Spokane, for Sept. 21
carried the following Associated Press dispatch from
Los Angeles:

Assistant Attorney General Warren Olney said
today Federal records show a “shocking” disparity
in the length of sentences imposed by different
judges for the same offense.

In an address prepared for the University of
California Law Sehool Association, Olney said the
justice department is studying possible steps to bring
about greater uniformity in the sentencing of federal

licf in their integrity. These and many other derog-
atory influences are instrumental in the impediment
of merey and justice for the deserving individuals.

It has been said, and will be quoted by many
learned men throughout the United States, that “the
human animal can only be caged a certain length of
years, and past that point demoralization takes
over.”

There are four stages of emotion which an inear-
ecrated man experiences while doing time: five years’
optimism; ten years’ hope; fifteen years’ passivity ;
twenty years’ non-hope and despair. These are not
statistics nor a census report, but a knowledge of my
fellowman’s hopes, dreams, and despairs after many
years in an identical situation. These four labels can
be lengthened out to fill many novels with idealistic
hopes of the man in prison. It is quite useless to cite
them here, as this article’s main theme is to elaborate
briefly on the specialized subject of “Man and Com-
mutation.”

Modern Penology’s progressive theme has been en-
couraging, but has not yet been fully understood by
most people. Penology’s main point is not advoecation
of erime, but more rehabilitative opportunities.
Coupled with this, is the treating of individual cases
and men when evaluating release and length of time
to be served. The intelligent mind knows that the old
“rubberhose” method only breeds a resentful and
sullen personality. Modern Penology does not wish
to create a monster, but rather to give incentive to
the prisoner toward being a decent citizen, respectful
of the laws of man and God.

law-breakers convicted of similar crimes.

“No matter how one looks at these cases,” he
said, “and no matter whether one believes that the
light sentence or the heavy sentence was the proper
one, the presence of inequality, disparity and con-
sequent unfairness and injustice is plainly apparent.

“Such cases have a very corrosive effect on any
program of rehabilitation for those convicted of
crime, and the presence in a penal institution of pris-
oners who have such utter contrasting sentences ecre-
ates an extremely serious institutional problem.”
