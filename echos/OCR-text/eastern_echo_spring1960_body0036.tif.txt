efforts of the Celtics. Albert Sheppard and Cochise scored 15
and 16 points respectively.

The Celtics were not forever daunted. On their next outing
they bounced back with a 52-35 victory over the Hawks. A. Shep
took personal charge and led the way with 21 points as the
Celtics smashed their way to victory. Game after game brought
thrill after thrill and the weather seemed to bother no one. As
the League progressed and the Dons began a drive for first-
place, the tension in the air could be cut with a spoon. The Dons
came on strong with a 70 to 58 point victory over the Hawks, a
60-55 victory over the Celtics, a 61-53 victory over the Reliables,
then repeated around the League before bowing to the Celtics
(55-52) in a hard fought game.

Finally, after the Dons had regained first place and the
season neared its close, the tightness of the league became more
evident. Fricker sank 24 points, Big Jim, 17, and contributions
from Freddie, Harl Brown, Holly, and Robinson, almost upset
the apple cart in a 58-57 thriller won by the Dons. In the decid-
ing game date it was the old nemisis, Reliable A. C., hit by in-
juries, that supplied the opposition for the powerful Dons led by
“Big’’? Jumping Jack Adderly. The heart and spirit of such
men as Shakey, Tucker, Norman, O’Brien, Billy, Wheeler, Chuck,
Joe, and Curly kept the issue in doubt until the last three min-
with Weiss, Woody, Junebug, and Juice carrying the load with
good defensive work from Vernon, Clark, Bernard, and inspir-
ation from Bunny, the Dons pulled away to a 44-39 Champion-
ship victory. However, the real story of the 59-60 season lies
with the tremendous job done by the “Hold it Together Men,’’
Fricker, Big Lou and Ralph—especially Lou. On a particular
occaision, when he needed it, Big Lou showed self-mastery and
reserve, averting near disaster by a heart-warming display of
diplomacy and self-reserve when the League got hot both on the
Court and in temperament. Basketball at Cherry Hill has grown
by leaps and bounds in the past seasons. This progress should
continue. The men deserve it.

Jan. 25 & 26—Despite of the second guessers and determination

Adderly, H. Cohens, D. Weiss and A. Wesley, as well as a power-
ful bench: Bernard, Charles Clark, Little Woody, V. Waites,
McCloud and R. Sharp; they were destined to go down in de-
feat in front of the All-Stars. Although the Dons were leading
by a one point margin when the game was discontinued until
the following day, “due to our time limit,’’ the All-Stars slept
with confidence that they would overtake their opponents for
the win.

The following afternoon at 2 p.m., the whistle was sounded
to resume play, on the jump Cochise tapped the ball over to
O’Brien who passed to Shakey and he dribbled in and laid it
up for two points and putting the All-Stars in front. Big
Tucker, Fricker and Shakey hit a hot streak and ran up an elght

seconds of the period when McCloud leaped and hit, fouled in
the process he made the one shot good and set the final score,
88-83.

with 25, Fricker 19, Shakey 16, and Cochise 15, O’Brien 7, Big

counted for 15, Juice played his heart out and gained 10 points
