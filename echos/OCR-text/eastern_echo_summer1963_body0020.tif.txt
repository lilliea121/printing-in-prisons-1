Every chess player recognizes the similarity be-
tween life and chess. To play strong chess one must
have patience, foresight, powers of concentration
and the ability to distinguish between good and bad
moves. These same talents are required in everyday

life.

When a weakness is discovered in our chess game,
looking deep within we will find the corresponding
weakness in our personality make-up. It is impos-

sible to correct the one without correcting the other.

Years of experience across the boards has enabled
me to obtain a close look at the personalities of my
opponents, many of whom have sported fronts to
keep their defects and shortcomings under cover
during the course of everyday life.
hide these defects on the chess board.

They cannot

All persons in prison (and many not in prison)
have defects of character which have caused them
to be in their present predicament. In order for
them to remain outside of the walls, once their re-
lease has been attained, these defects must be

corrected.

The first step calls for recognizing these weak-
nesses and admitting that we, and not society, are
wrong. Once we are able to accept the responsi-
bility for our misdeeds, then we can seek the means

to correct the weaknesses that have caused our down-

fall.

Most of us are proud of our individuality, believ-
ing that through crime we are expressing ourselves as
individuals and showing the world we are claiming
the rights of individuals to life, liberty and happiness.

True, these are the basic rights of all, but no one
is permitted to exercise them by violating the rights
of others; which in effect all perpetrators of crime
are doing.

When the rights of others are violated, then the
violators forfeit all claims to their own. Only when
society is assured that these violations will not be re-
peated will they feel safe in permitting us to return to
their midst.

To live as an individual one must first

Many of us were of the opinion that the world
owed us a living; on the contrary, the world owes us
nothing. A person only receives from this world
what he puts into it. Give evil and you will receive

evil; give good and you receive good.

In the course of expressing ourselves as individuals
we showed utter contempt for all authority. No
one was going to tell us what we could or could not
do. This is ridiculous.

Our behavior in the past is a good example why

authority and discipline are necessary.

Someone has to direct us so that we may
continue to live. Without authority and discipline
we would revert back to an era beyond our known
history, and God only knows what would happen
then. In all probability, few of us would be alive

today.

Until man attains the pinnacle of civilization
where the rights of others will be respected above
his own, laws will be a necessity. If he ever reaches
that goal there will not be a need for authority and

discipline.

After accepting the fact that we are the cause of
our troubles we must begin to educate ourselves to
attain the right perspective towards life. Every

individual has certain principles which govern his
