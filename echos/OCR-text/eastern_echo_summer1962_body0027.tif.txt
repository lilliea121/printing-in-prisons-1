he ll say, “Will you play Lammy Rove me True...
Oh, excuse me, I mean, Tammy Love Me True’...
This type of nervous afflection is highly contagious,
and I usually find myself saying, “Shy wure’’ I mean
minty SUTe oe. He smiles his thanks, starts
skipping away, and waves his handbag bye-bye at
me, and returns to the sewing class that he had just

left.

He approached me cautiously.

Yes, it’s a shame, nobody liked him, in fact there
is a rumor around that his mother was arrested for
trying to erase her name from his birth certificate.

THE ESPIRT DE CORPS AMONG US 4 DJ's

There is, of course, a spirit of great friendliness
among our 4 Disc Jockeys, just one big happy family
ee On one occasion I| lost 3 fingers just because
I reached for an Elvis Presley record that one of my
friends had his eye on. Another time | barely hinted
that my program was a little better than a certain
other program. That night on returning to my cell
I find a note which read,"“You got 24 hours to get

out of town bum’’. It was signed by the Pennsylvania
Railroad, but we know who sent it, don’t we?....

The next day it took 9 husky guards to break us up,
but I did recover 2 of my missing three fingers, (at
least | think their mine)—plus 3 thumbs........
| keep the thumbs in a jar, they come in handy....
I read a lot, you see.

THE END
OR
BEING A “D J’ HASN’T AFFECTED ME

I cannot remember how | became a prison Disc
Jockey, of course | realize | only took the job to be
able to hear my favorite records. I recall Mother
was frightened by a broken record when I was a
baby, but I don’t think that had any connection
with me being a Disc Jockey, because it never
affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me,
affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me,

affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me, affected

affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me, affected
affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me,
affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me, affected me,

Mingus Mania

Charles Mingus, often discussed as a petulant
stormy petrel, is often more victim of the news
conscious than he is really two-gun notorious.
Witness his last engagement at New York’s
Village Gate.

Co-owner Joe Tremini called Mingus’ mana-
ger to demand some action.

“What’s going on’? asked the manager,
ts oD DoD

“Mingus has been here for a week now; no
trouble; no telling the customers off. Talk to
Mingus, will you?” “It’s bad for business. .
