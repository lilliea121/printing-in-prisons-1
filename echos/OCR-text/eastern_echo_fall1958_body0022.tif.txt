Employer Needed continued

for the Parole Board to decide. However, I do know
that employment is a necessity. Therefore, Inmates
eligible for parole need the understanding and prot-
fered hand of assistance from Employers, before
they can once again become an integral part of so-
ciety.

One point I must emphasize. Men being re-
leased on parole have records that vary consider-
ably. Some have experienced years of difficulty
in adjusting to the accepted pattern of social be-
havior. However, regardless of the length of a
man’s criminal record, this is not indicative of his
future behavior. If you, as an Employer, were to
eall and ask us personally, “Which of these men
would you consider to be the best risk?”, we, in all
fairness, would then have to answer, “Both!” It is
an impossibility to predetermine the actions of any
man, whether he be a man with a criminal record,
or one without. Can you analyze and predict the
future of any man in your Company? You may be
able to point out the men most likely to succeed.
But, I have no doubts that there are men in prison
whose pictures in year books overlook the phrase,
“Most likely to succeed!” We can only refer you
to the figures we presented for your edification in
our last article; approximately 89% of the men
placed on Parole, year 1956, maintained an accepted
status in society. May I add that the percentage for
1957 was very nearly identical to this percentage.
This is amazing in view of the strict parole rules and
regulations these men are subject to. Allow us to
enlighten you as to some of the ‘“Don’ts” in the
Board of Parole Rules, Regulations and Conditions
Governing Parole.

1. You are required to have the written permission
of your Parole Agent before you may:

A. Leave the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
or the community to which you have been
paroled.

B. Change your residence or employment.

C. Possess or apply for a license to hunt or to
operate a motor vehicle or aircraft.

D. Get married.

2. You must support your dependents, if any, and
assume towards them all your moral and legal obli-
gations.

3. You should not drink whiskey, wine, beer, gin,
or any other beverage containing alcohol.

4. You will not associate with any person having
a criminal record, with any person of bad reputa-
tion, or with any other individual your Parole Agent
forbids you to associate with.

do. You must permit your Parole Agent to visit you
at your home and place of employment at any time.

These are a few of the regulations. They are
not in the order in which listed on the Rule Sheet,
but give you a general idea of the restrictions a
“parolee” lives under. Violation of one stipulation
may lead to the man being returned to prison for a
number of years. Although these rules restrict the
individual ‘parolee’ in his quest for a normal social
life, they are advantageous to the Employer. The
personal demeanor of his employee is under constant
supervision.

As I have previously mentioned, I interviewed
the above men personally, I was impressed with the
one thing they seem to have in common. That is
their apparent sincerity in wanting to become ac-
cepted members of society. The men who have
had the misfortune to run afoul of the laws of juris-
prudence for years on end, gave me the impression
that they had reached their individual “low”. AlI-
though they have experienced freedom from time
to time in the past, deep down inside, they realize
that they were not free at all. Many centuries ago,
Jesus told his disciples that real freedom comes as a
result of hving by the truth in all areas of life.
Through my personal observations, I believe that
these men have come to realize the meaning of real
freedom. I believe that they realize the obligations
one must accept to attain this goal.

We hope that one of the above men may be
utilized in your organization. We have one dis-
advantage in our program. Our men cannot come
to you for a personal interview. However, if you
would lke to come into our Institution and speak
with them,—you shall be made a most ‘welcome
guest. It only requires a telephone eall to Mr.
Edward A. Rufus, our Parole Officer, Po 5-1106, and
he shall be most willing to assist you in making the
necessary arrangements. Mr. Rufus shall also make
available for your information, the Criminal Record
of the man in whom you are interested, as well as
arrange for you to talk to members of our Staff
who have been associated with the man’s progress.
This information, of course, is available to prospec-
tive Employers only. (Information of this type is
considered confidential and is not issued promis-
cuously. )

A few months ago, we celebrated the 4th of
July. In our City is a hallowed shrine. The Lib-
erty Bell. This bell is enshrined in Independence
Hall. A symbol of liberty and freedom, it was fit-
tingly rung in July 1776, to proclaim the adoption
of the Declaration of Independence. This beloved
bell bears the inscription, “Proclaim liberty through-
out all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof.”
Mr. Employer, you have the unique opportunity of
ringing that-bell once again. It can be a proclama-
tion of lberty throughout this Institution unto all
the inhabitants thereof! Give the rope a lusty tug!

We are most anxious to hear from you. We
cannot overemphasize your importance to us.
