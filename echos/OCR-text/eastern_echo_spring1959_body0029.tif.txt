book in hand and an understanding smile on his
face, gave Snoopy assurance that Charlie would
survive.

KINDNESS MAKES THE MAN

Trotting around the Yard one night recently,
Snoopy had to give a happy wag of his tail when he
saw Dave Croxton crossing the basketball court in
the glare of the Center-Tower spotlight. Holding in
his arms an invalid friend, Dave’s steps lengthened
his shadow into a streak across the yard. Gaining
a firmer grip on his passenger, Dave clumped up the
steep, iron stairway and into the Movie Hall.

THE BEST OF THE BEST

Curled up under a barber chair, with ears alert
and a knowing look in his eyes, Snoopy was listen-
ing to Henry Saby who is currently convalescing
from a football injury. While hair flew in all direc-
tions, Saby was exclaiming for the umpteenth time
why he should have been in ninety other places
rather than at left end in one of the past season’s
gridiron duels, wherein he broke his shoulder.

He had nothing but praise for the lovely Ladies-

in-White at the P.G.H. who pulled him through his

erisis. This being no mean piece of medical won-
der when you consider the deep affection Saby had
for his erisis, and the female-administered treat-
ments it motivated.

Saby let one and all know that the surgeon who
operated on him was none other than the same Dr.
De Palma, whose surgical skill enabled Granny
Hamner, Phillies infielder, to regain use of a dis-
abled shoulder. We, of course, hope that Saby re-
gains full use of his arm, and perhaps a little of
Granny Hamner rubbed off on him, to be evidenced
in his play this coming season.

DON'T BE SO FORMAL

Doing a little classroom-peeping, Snoopy heard
a bit of interesting chit-chat. The teacher was heard
to ask, “Mr. Daunt, will you please step up to the
blackboard?” A soft voice replied, ‘Just call me
Jackie.”

FOR LOVERS OF WIDE OPEN SPACES

In ages past, the convict was, more often than
not, chosen to be among those who explored beyond

SOME PROGRESS

horizons for new lands. Columbus is reported to
have set sail with a crew made up almost entirely of
felons. Snoopy wonders when they will start draft-
ing us for a trip into outer space. If anyone is inter-
ested in such a venture, please contact Tony Space
on 12/2nd. He will be happy to give you all the de-
tails and fill you in on all the qualifications a true
spaceman will need.

A DINNER WELL-DONE

Snoopy has it from good authority that the first
meal James “Botchie” Van Sant ordered upon leay-
ing these premises was PRESSED DUCK. This was
in commemoration of a like dinner, which the
gendarmes so rudely interrupted many years ago.

It has also been related that the bill for said
dinner was forwarded to one “Mike” Quinn, a local
resident. The original feed was supposedly on him,
and since he is not the type to let a couple of decades
make a difference, Mike graciously accepted the tab.

PRACTICE WITH A PURPOSE

A remarkable example of what stick-to-it-
tiveness can do for a diligent person is evident in the
person of John Craig, a twenty-five-year-old inmate
here at E.S.P.

Afflicted with Cerebral Palsy since birth, John
has begun a weight-lifting course, entirely on his
own, to enable him to gain better control of his af-
fected muscles.

The progress he has made is surprising, and a
testimonial to his perseverance. We wish him further
progress as the only fitting reward for such personal
endeavor.

A SIGHT TO BEHOLD

A many-splendored apparition appeared on the
seene recently. It seems he had been helping Jim
Beatty, the world’s most under-paid instructor, who
turns out class after class of skilled sign-painrters.
The paint-splashed beauty was none other than our
own prowling pup.

A BIT OF CANINE WISDOM

Barking out his first quote of the year, Snoopy
claims that, ‘The secret of prison longevity is—to
do a day at a time.”

FaAZOorse

Eastern Echo

When his attempt to rob a Detroit Bank was thwarted, an 33-year-old man, who
admittedly had spent 69 years of his life behind bars, was held for investigation of
robbery. His possessions at the time of arrest included a pair of broken eye glasses,
a pocket knife, safety razor and three razor blades.

“Is this all you've got to show for 83 years?” police asked.

“I've made progress,” he replied. “When | was young they didn’t have safety
