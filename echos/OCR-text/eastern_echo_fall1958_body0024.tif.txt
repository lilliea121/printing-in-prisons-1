On July 4th, as early as 8 a.m., one looking out
toward the improved recreation field, would have
anticipated a big day in the making. Mr. T.H.
Graham, Director of Recreation, and his hastily se-
lected assistants—George “Obie” O’Brien, Joseph
Brown, Johnny Bowers and John Gilmore—were
making final preparations for the annual Field Day.

When Yard-Out was called, the field and the
bandstand were in readiness. The musicians ar-
rived along with the athletes a few minutes after
9am. While musicians were shaping their lips, ad-
justing fingers, and stretching goat and cowhide, the
track and field participants went into their calis-
thenics.

At 9:30 am., Mr. Graham announced over the
loudspeaker, ‘“‘Activities will start with the orches-
tra playing the National Anthem.”

In the early morning sunshine, the participants
for the first event, The Sack Race, were called. There
were more sackers than sacks, so through the elim-
ination process, two heats were run.

ist Heat: 1Ist-David Croxton, 2nd-Leonard Mas-

sey.

2nd Heat: Ist-Billy Holmes, 2nd-Al Jenkins,
3rd-Frank Ray.

Finals: 1st-Al Jenkins, 2nd-Billy Holmes, 3rd-

David Croxton.

ins, 2nd-Holmes and Dick Johnson, 3rd-Mathew
Smith and Eddie Bland, 4th-Massey and Brumskill.

Fat-Man-Race Finals: Ist-Nylon Taylor (255), 2nd-
Arthur (283), 38rd-Williiam “Stumpy” Middleton

son, 2nd-Croxton and Norman Pearson, 3rd-Holmes

Brooks. Piggy-Back-Race Finals: lst-Jenkins and
Johnson, 2nd-Frank Ray and Croxton, 3rd-Bernard
“Doe” Allen and Alvin “Shakey” Young, 4th-Stew-
art and Brooks.

Preceding the fifth event, intermission was an-
nounced. Athletes and spectators swarmed to the
bandstand and listened to the fine arrangements of
the Institution Orchestra, under the direction of Joe
Facio.

Musical Notes, arranged in various ways, seem
to have a magnetic influence over people in all walks

of life. Several weeks ago, Yours Truly noticed a
fellow walking about the yard. This fellow had
not been here too long at the time and if someone
had told me he was a magnificent tap dancer, I
probably would have said. “Baloney! Why, he
ean just about walk.” How wrong I would have
been. Clarence Barge, the fellow of mention, is real
great with his feet.

Another fellow who I had seen quite a few times
in the Hospital Block, his neck and shoulders in a
brace, caused me to think, “Gee, what a tough
break. He must have a broken neck.” One day,
I almost blindly walked into Don Weston (he of the
brace), narrowly avoiding him. I thought, “Had I
even brushed against him, I might have hurt him.”
But, here he was dancing the mambo, conga and
rock’n and roll’n with Hereules Butler and Chuck
Morris to the music of the Inmate Orchestra. If
the collision had occurred, he probably would have
apologized and asked me if I was hurt.

The final event of the morning was the 100-
Yard-Dash Eliminations. In the six heats, the fol-
lowing winners gained the finals: Jenkins, Brooks,
Johnson, Shakey Young, Croxton and Gardner.

With forty-five minutes remaining before lunch,
the music lovers again crowded ’round the band-
stand. Facio and his Boys played a few request
numbers causing the listeners to call for more, but
Facio declined. The musicians, with the exception
of Bill Shoonmaker, drummer, and William “Slick”
Matthews, guitarist, gathered their instruments and
departed for the morning.

With the drummer and guitarist remaining in
action, the music continued. Clarence Barge climbed
up on the platform and practically danced the taps
off his shoes. He danced until drenched with pres-
piration; only then did he cease and the remaining
musicians retired.

The appreciative gathering clamored for more.
Someone handed “Doc” Allen an old tub, Barge
came on with a bucket and, thus, exotic sound and
dancing by Weston, Butler and Morris continued
until Yard-In.

AFTERNOON HAPPENINGS

In the afternoon, the Hundred-Yard-Dash final-
ists were the first to toe the mark. Down a six-lane
track, the six runners came, straining every muscle
until one began to pull away .. . it was “Shaky”
Young. He broke the tape a good ten feet ahead
of Croxton, 3rd was Johnson, 4th-Jenkins, 5th-
Brooks and 6th-Gardner. Time 9.7:2.

Of twelve High-Jump contestants, Charles Ad-
derly proved the best. He won with a jump of 5
ft.4in. Hook and Stewart tied for 2nd with marks
Ol 205. & uM

The Shot-Put was also won by Adderly with a
