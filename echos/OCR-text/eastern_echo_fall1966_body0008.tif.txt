“Man, I ain’t worried about getting out, I know
when that will be. I’m concerned with staying out.”
Strange words? Not really.

One inmate speaks the words but many more are
also concerned with this problem. And it is a prob-
lem. The latest figure I have read shows 86% of in-
mates released return to prison.* Statistics can be
misleading and I want to believe that this one is.
But I can’t be sure. I’m worried now! I haven’t been
released yet, and the odds are 3% to 4 that I will
come back.

Let us look at this a little closer. Eighty-six in-
mates out of every 100 return to prison and with
crime on the increase, the intake of new prisoners
has increased considerably. If only 14 men out of
100 remain out and the new inmates in turn become
one of the 86 out of 100, it stands to reason that
prison populations are getting larger and larger. If
this continues then we can assume with statistical
logic that one day everyone will be behind the wall.
Well, we will have attained something, anyway. We
would be rid of ex-convicts.

To be sure, I have allowed myself to be carried
away; but only to show the fallacy of statistics. Re-
gardless of the percentage of men who return, it is
still too many. Why is this so? We read numerous
articles in the newspapers and magazines about the
rehabilitation programs being instituted in our pris-
ans. This should solve the problem.

Rehabilitation is an impressive word. It sounds
important. Webster says it means to restore to good

repute; to fit to make one’s livelihood again. How is
one fit to make one’s livelihood again when one had
no livelihood to begin with? The majority of men in
prison come from poverty areas, have little educa-
tion and, in most eases, no trade or eraft in order to
earn a decent livelihood by today’s standards. Prison
does little to change this. Today, high school classes
are offered to all who want them terminating with a
high school equivalency diploma. This is a means to
an end, not an end in itself. The next logical step
would seem to be vocational training in one craft or
another. This is where the rub comes in. Except for
a few of the Correctional Industries, the possibilities
of acquiring a skill that would be acceptable by the
trade unions outside are extremely rare.

Contrary to popular belief, prisons have not
changed. New names have been bestowed upon them
and an array of fancy titles for the pesonnel but
prisons are the same as they have always been. The
greatest amount of jobs to be had are prison ori-
ented, ie., cell block runners, yard cleaners, brass
polishers, sweepers, moppers, pot washers, table
wipers and assorted labor work. The few men who
enter prison with any skill are immediately placed
into those spots, leaving little chance for the un-
skilled.

Correctional Industries is not, in itself, the answer.
It could be, but at present it offers little opportunity
for the individual to acquire a skill that, would be on
a competitive level with outside industry. They en-
compass the products that will be used mainly by
prisons, state hospitals and various state-operated in-
stitutions. The machinery and equipment is usually
antiquated, instruction personnel at a minimum and
production is geared to a large unskilled labor force
at the lowest possible cost.

The Printing Plant at Eastern Correctional Insti-
tution is one of the exceptions. Printing is one of the
highest paying industries in the United States and
has only just begun to realize its potential. Our
plant is equipped with contemporary machines and
uses production methods incorporated from outside
industry. Experienced instructors supervise all op-
erations of printing from beginning to end, but more
are needed. Through the efforts of Mr. Veto
Iavecchia, General Supervisor, and Mr. Al French,
Printing Instructor, the local printing trade unions
have been approached with the idea of accepting
qualified men into the union and placing them into
positions of employment upon discharge from the
institution. The unions have reacted favorably to
this and, to date, there are a few dozen men working
at this craft; linotype operators, compositors, press-
men, and two men who have become department
foremen.

The Printing Plant is, by no means, the answer to
a gigantic problem, it is only a small beginning. The
problem, immense though it is, must have a begin-
ning if it is ever to have an end.
