that I’d get engaged for a while, first. You know—
sort of make sure, instead of just jumping into
marriage.”’

‘‘That’s okay, Glo,’’ Pete says, acting like he’s
the All American Boy. ‘‘I understand.”’

‘“‘Then you mean we’re engaged?’’ she asks,
and she starts oozing ecstasy all over the place.

‘*Bet. your life we are,’’ Pete tells her.

’? Oh, wonn - derful! Then I’ll meet you at noon
tomorrow, and we can pick out the ring.”’

She follows this by planting a kiss right on
top of Pete’s head, which is about as bare as Egypt
was when the locusts got through with it. And
that is how Sure Pop Pete gets trapped into taking
little Gloria out on a diamond safari.

Needless to say, Gloria lures Pete into the most
lavish jewelry emporium in town, and after many
‘‘Ohs’’?’ and ‘‘Ahs’’ and squeals of delight, she
pounces on a little bauble that is slightly smaller
than the Yankee Stadium. The price tag on this
trinket is a mere $5,200, and as soon as the rescue
squad revives him Pete starts to do some mental
sharp-shooting.

He has, give or take a few coconuts, around six
grand. If he shells out the wherewithal for the ring,
it will leave him something in the neighborhood of
$800, and this neighborhood, as far as Pete is
concerned, is strictly nowhere.

Sure Pop toys with the idea of sliding out of
the sale, but then his beady little eyes lick greedily
over the fair Gloria and he pulls $200 out of his
mothproof wallet and tells the salesman he will be
back with the rest in a day or so. Then he takes
leave of his beaming bride to be and walks down
the street toward the hotel where the Indians, with
their prize rookie, Rube Jensen, are esconced while
waiting to beat the ears off the Yankees.

Now, Rube Jensen is about the hottest hunk
of real estate to come up to the Indians since Sitting
Bull was just a little calf. He is known to be a bit
muscle bound between the ears. But he wins eleven
in a row for the Tribe, so the fact that he isn’t
exactly the seventh son of a seventh son doesn’t
dampen their enthusiasm for him. With Rube on

The next day the papers are full of the story.

price is nine to five against the Yankees.

Rube is stumbling through the latest issue of
‘‘Mairyland Comics’? when Pete’s knock sounds
on his door. Reluctantly tearing himself away from
the poor princess who is being kicked around by
the wicked old witch, he calls out ‘‘C’mon in. It
ain’t locked.”’

As Pete enters, his greasy little eyes slide
furtively over the room. Satisfied that there is no
one lurking about, Pete begins his skullduggery
with an oily smile and a ‘‘Hi, kid.”’

‘“‘T ean’t recollect ever seein’ you, mister.
Mebbe if’n you’d tell me your name... ”’

‘“‘My name’s not important, kid,’’ Pete purrs,
‘‘T’m here to do you a favor.”’

‘‘Wull, thank yuh kindly,’’ gulps Rube, ‘‘this
sure is a friendly town.”’

‘‘Tiook, Rube,’’ says Pete, getting down to bus-
iness.’’ I been watching you ever since the season
started, and I don’t think the Indians are paying
you enough money.’’

‘“Why shucks, mister. I don’t rightly. . .”’

‘‘How would you lke to make five hundred
dollars?’’ interrupts Pete.

“I'd reekon ld like it, fines.

‘“‘Good! All I want you to do is throw the game
tonight,’’ Pete tells him, as he pulls five C-notes
off of his wad.

“‘But, gee mister, I. . .’’

“Mut, tut, my lad,’’ clucks Pete as he presses
the wampum into Rube’s hand.’’ Just make it
look good will you?”’

‘“‘Well. . okay. And I aim to.make it extry
good, jest for you. Thank yuh, sir.”’

“That’s all right,’’? says Pete, starting for the
door. ‘‘Always glad to give someone a helping
