An
Escape

A woman, on the verge of a nervous breakdown,
went to see a doctor. The doctor, after a careful
examination, gave her this advice: ‘‘Madam, I
would advise that you spend fifteen minutes every
morning in private devotion. Read your bible for
five minutes; if you don’t have one, buy one. Think
about what you have read for another five minutes,
then talk to God for five minutes. If you don’t know
how to pray, learn how. You are simply God-hun-
ery!’’? The woman saw red, became angry and re-
monstrated, ‘‘I came here for physical diagnosis,
not for spiritual advice.’’ The doctor answered,
‘‘Madam, that is my diagnosis and it will cost you
fifty dollars!’’ Furiously she stormed out of the
office, but because she was desperate and needed re-

Recently Archbishop Cushing of Boston wrote
an article in the Friar Magazine which, I believe,
is worth repeating in our quarterly.

‘‘Many persons accept religion as a kind of
sedative, a calming, consoling balm to the afflicted
spirit, and little more. Communists once called
religion the opium of the people and the devout
resented the designation. Yet, one sometimes fears
that many make of their religion little more than
an opiate for their own torments and for the worries
of society. They have themselves succumbed to
a concept of religion which is far more concerned
with the sweet relief that Faith is expected to pro-
vide, than with the stimulus to dynamic life, which
is the essence of genuine religious Faith.

‘“Our Blessed Lord constantly illustrated His
concept of the spiritual life by striking phrases
suggestive not of repose or lassitude or peaceful
rest, but of energetic action, heroic struggle and
dynamie vitality. ‘‘I have come that they may have
life and have it more abundantly!’’ ‘‘I have come
to bring down fire on earth, and what will IJ, but that
it burn!’’ ‘‘The kingdom of Heaven suffereth vio-
lence and the violent bear it away!’’

‘‘Religion is, of course, a comfort for the
troubled mind; it does soothe the hurt spirit as

lief she tried it; her nerves simmered down, she
received spiritual strength and the rampaging fears
stopped gnawing at her heart. There was but one
real difficulty with her disposition, she was God-
hungry.

Remember, as someone has said, ‘‘Thou hast
made us for Thyself, O God, and we are restless
until we rest in Thee.’’ Truly there is a God-shaped
vacuum in everyone’s heart. If God is absent from
this seat of authority then a much less gracious
Master will dominate. The hungry tiger takes it
out on everyone with whom he comes in contact.
You and I do the same when we exist without the
inner peace that tells us that when we are right with
God it will be easier to be right with other people.
The Kingdom of God is built on the framework of
proper relationships. Unless Christ is at the center
we cannot maintain a satisfactory relationship with
our fellow men.

The Salvation Army, in launching its annual
Salvation Army week, May 19-26, 1957, published
the following statement in description of its ac-
tivities ; “‘ With HEART to God and HAND to man.’’
You are leaving out of your life one of the most
important ingredients of satisfaction, service and
success, if you are by-passing God and neglecting
your spiritual life. Let’s make Him the center and
I assure you, the circumference will take care of
itself.
