actually is broken down to 90% box refrigeration
(or refrigerator conditioning—those seven big jobs).
This leaves only 10% for the ice making, but if the
entire capacity of the Ice Plant, operating on a theo-
retical 100% efficiency, were converted to the mak-
ing of ice only, then 25 ton could be made per day.
In brief, this is a picture of the size operation
Charles Thornton is qualified to run! And remem-
ber that this inmate knows the entire maintenance of
the plant, including complete overhauling of the
three five-by-five, eight ton compressors!

Thornton gives the following account of his
1955 saga:

‘‘Mr. Riley left on his vacation. I was operat-
ing the three compressors alone when they began to
take turns freezing up. I located the immediate
cause in the float valves on the individual compres-
sors and through these failing to hold the ammonia
back, ammonia flooded each compressor so that they
froze up and stopped. What I mean is, both of two
intake and both of two exhaust valves froze in each
case, and the pistons froze to the cylinder walls.

“‘In a period of 21 days and nights, these three
compressors froze 70 to 75 times and I had to over-
haul each compressor as many times. Since two
compressors had to be kept going at all times, to
prevent food spoilage in the refrigerators, it meant
I was working on one compressor all the time. I
worked from one to another, you understand—lI
didn’t have the time to trouble-shoot the entire

system myself.

‘‘Tt’s true I slept in fifteen minute snatches in
my chair. I couldn’t leave the system, even for a
minute,’’ Thornton added.

At the close of my interview, I asked Thornton
if he was ready to take an examination for licensing
purposes in refrigeration.

““Yes,’? he answered. ‘‘The examination is
probably pretty stiff, but I think I’m ready. And
with 21% years experience behind me now, I think
with just a short time for going over the layout of
an Ice Plant—they each have their differences, you
know—I think I could handle any one of a capacity
approximating the one here at the penitentiary.’’
But as Mr. Riley previously stated—we have no
doubts whatever but that Charlie Thornton could
do just that!

I am not quite sure I know what is meant by the
word rehabilitation, but whatever it means, this
quiet, presentable 86 year old man who has spent
his servitude mastering a tough trade—refrigera-
tion—certainly qualifies as a rehabilitated inmate.
And an outstanding job of rehabilitation at that.
When he is eventually returned to his home in
Chester, Pa., where there are three or four ice plants
in operation, I am sure that he can put his knowledge
of the refrigeration field to productive and prof-
itable use.

The ECHO is proud to profile such men as
Charles Thornton.

REPORT ON GROUP COUNSELING

hy Albert Winkler

Let’s face it: everyone has a problem, or is a
problem to himself... fighting himself .. . fighting
his environment ... fighting his battle alone, so he
thinks,

No one need be alone in fighting any problem
which is devouring his better sense and/or nature.
(Most everyone has a good side, if only it were ad-
mitted.) Group Counseling will tend to help any
member solve his problem and recognize his place
in the scheme of things as they are. He can help
himself into a recognized place in the scheme of
things as they are.

All this is accomplished by frank discussion of
individual problems, as soon as any member becomes
free in mind to the extent that he knows no harm
can come to his way of thinking. There is no set
rule by which he can become free of inhibitions;
it comes ‘‘natural’’, as natural as life itself. A
frank discussion on any subject matter brought up
within the group tends to free his mind of fear.
The only thing that hurts any individual’s way of
thinking is fear itself.

EASTERN ECHO

It is possible that many of us do not understand
the wording of — the sense of — any article dealing
with the subject of Group Counseling. This is an
understandable thing. Because of this possibility,
then, let me make my point absolutely clear: before
any member of a group volunteers to bring his pet
fear, gripe or problem into group focus, he can and
does listen to others in the group — others who,
having become accustomed, or used to, the impartial
discussions under way, have cast all fear aside and
become natural again.

This listening to other peoples’ gripes, fears and
problems has a good effect upon the newcomer in the
group. It opens up possibilities within his own
mind — possibilities to the effect that perhaps his
own problems can also be solved when brought into
the light of group focus. Such voluntary action
also tends to help him whenever he feels tongue-tied,
as in the ease of all of us who someday must come
face to face with one aspect of prison life: the con-

tact, say, with Boards of Parole and/or Classification,

and Staff Boards for parole and commutation.
