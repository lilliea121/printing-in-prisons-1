In the forefront of American jurisprudence stands
the advocate—that colorful figure of fact and fiction
who has caused more controversy than the brain
trusts and criminals he has prosecuted and defended.
The target of arrows, from the barbed invective to
the silver platitude. The advocate holds the fate of
more lives in the palm of his hand than the surgeon.
A home, a marriage, a life, the future of our country
more often than not balances on the fine edge of legal
acumen.

Although our criminal law is an archaic jumble of
conflicting statutes its substance is fairly well agreed
upon. There is no question that arson, larceny, rob-
bery, murder and rape are crimes. Just as there is
controversy about homosexuality, gambling, prostitu-
tion, alcoholism and drug addiction. By the same
token, as long as we have the death penalty its pros
and cons will be heatedly debated. (Lately there has
been much concern and disagreement on the legal
responsibilities of the mentally ill and defective.)
Extensive work must be done to unify our criminal
codes, but this task is perpetual because law and the
society it serves is in a constant state of change, and
always will be.

Progress toward the formulation of a model penal
code leaves much to be desired when it is remem-
bered it may only take days to enact a new law; but
it usually takes decades to modify or correct its defi-
ciencies.

It is when we leave the statutory area of law and
consider the administration of justice that we find
chaos, confusion and pitiful discrimination. For it is
in the application of the due process of law that we
miserably fail. Few people are aware that when a
person is convicted of a crime it is the due process
clause of the law that detemines the degree of guilt,
culpability, aggravation, mitigation and, of course,
the subsequent penalty. The innocence or guilt of a
defendant is important; but justice or due process of
the law is of greater importance—for this is the way
in which a democratic society protects itself from its

own excesses! In the literal meaning, procedure
means due process.
How does it work—or does it work? How often

does it fail?

According to the American Civil Liberties Union
78% of the people indicted for a felony are unable
to afford a lawyer and this is the greatest reason for

often said, ‘‘In the eyes of the law all men are equal.”
This might be closer to the truth if they have equal
funds and equal representation. In our system of law
the prosecutor represents the State versus counsel for
the defense. Yet in many of our courts if the defend-
ant cannot afford legal representation nothing is done
about it. He just does not have anyone represent
him. Many courts appoint counsel, others have a
public defender paid by the State. So at one and the
same time, the State both prosecutes and “‘defends’”’
the defendant; often an inequitable situation when
the public defender is politically appointed. The stig-
ma of the police state then exists. In the case of the
public defender—the system used more and more in
the larger cities—his work load is usually so great he
can only give a routine and indfferent effort to each
case; not that of the true advocate who knows that
justice depends on his ability, skill and devotion to
lis client's cause. This is not to imply that public
defenders are not dedicated men. Some of them are,
and are well aware of the injustice, limited time and
attention creates in the defense of their charges. Sel-
dom does the indigent defendant have counsel at the
all-important preliminary hearing, when the charge is
presented with the possibilities of a plea to a lesser
charge being more in the interest of justice. True,
sometimes he has an opportunity to retract his plea
later if counsel is provided, but the die has already
been cast. Thus we see how important it is for the
defendant to have legal counsel at every stage of his
indictment. Seldom, if ever, is he visited by the pub-
lic defender before his trial. Little investigation of the
charges or the circumstances involved in the indict-
ment is made, unless you call the brief explanation
made by the defendant—regarding his role in these
charges—an investigation. The defendant's first en-
counter with the bill of information on a felony
charge is usually at the time of plea, when the defend-
ant due to nervousness and apprehension, is in poor
shape to fully understand the information and the ~
implications. (It is well to remember over 60% of
men facing a felony charge do not have an element-
ary education). Only minutes later he is asked how
he pleads: ‘‘guilty or not guilty?’’ Often the court
reserves the right to accept or reject the plea due to
the court’s doubt of the defendant's comprehension
