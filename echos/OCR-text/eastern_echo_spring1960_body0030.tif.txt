A “New and Fantastic” weapon has been broad-
cast to the world by Premier Nekita Krushchey. The
Premier stated, “Russian scientists have it in the
hatching stage.”

He does not state that this weapon is developed
or anything else relating to it. Yet, the press, T. V.
and radio, have all drawn a picture for us of its po-
tentialities.

Who has seen it? Or for that matter any proof
other than the Premier’s statement that the bomb or
whatever it is actually exists. However, who doubts
even without a shred of proof—that it exists?

The human intellect can accept and reject
threats, concepts, proof, logic, lies, and reasoning
with a flexibility bordering on the ludicrous, at one
time accepting a half-truth and rejecting at an other
a whole truth, depending entirely on the moods pub-
lic opinion has created, sometimes using logic, some-
times pure propaganda as a yardstick.

A professor will sit across a table from a reason-
able thinking man and explain the laws of kinetics,
explaining in lay terms that the very table they sit
at is not a solid mass of innate matter; that rather it
is a continuous mass of moving, ever circling atoms.
You look, nothing is moving before your eyes. You
touch it, it’s surface-hard and flat under your hand.
To your senses his theories are a lie. Yet, unquestion-
ably we accept what we cannot see and cannot feel.

Do you fully understand Einstein’s theory on
relativity? Hardly, and of course, neither do I.
There are hardly a dozen men in the whole world who
do. Yet, not understanding it, we accept this
theorum. Why? Is it because men of great learning
and letters have expounded these mysteries? I do
not think so; that argument is too easy to refute.

Little Echoes

of Time

Men of equally great learning in their own fields have
had their theories rejected. Criminologists, who have
spent their life in the study of crime and its causes
have argued for years that punishment does not
deter crime.

From Andrew J. Palms “The Death Penalty,”
written in 1891, comes the following:

“At the National Conference of Charities held
in Louisville, Ky., in 1883, the report of the standing
committee on crimes and penalties, prepared by
seven members, all persons of ability and experience
in dealing with criminals, contained the following
paragraph:

“The inefficiency of criminal punishments to re-
press crime at present and throughout the ages is be-
lieved to be largely attributable to the spirit of re-
taliation that pervades them; at least it may be safely
said that the deterrent principle, if not an entire
failure, has not yet found its true place in public pun-
ishment for crime. The sanguinary punishments of
all history are accompanied with numerous crimes,
while offences have diminished as penalties have been
softened. Neither amphitheatre, stake, nor cross, nor
sewn with serpents in the sack and thrown into the
sea, indeed nothing of penalty that human ingenuity
could devise, has prevented crimes to any observable
extent.” And criminologists have been swearing to
these statements ever since, with relatively few ac-
cepting their opinions.

The Russians at one time or another have laid
claim to all or nearly all the inventions of man—the
telephone, radio, ete. Perhaps as the Premier stated,
they have a new and fantastic weapon, but until we
are made aware of some kind of concrete proof, I
don’t think we should surrender.
