Nature has been responsible for bringing man and
all forms of animal life to their present state; a
unique individual species, with a system of checks
and balances among themselves. This has been ac-
complished through the passing of innumerable
“years of time.’’ Some call it evolution—others cre-
ation, or God's handiwork. The history of this so-
called evolutionary process presents a most fascinat-
ing story, but one which the majority of us consider
only lightly in relation to ourselves and what makes
us stick:

Members of the Human Race (even prisoners),
should take a more positive interest in the external
and inherent influences which continue to aid our
perpetual functioning in this world. We should fre-
quently inquire into all aspects of man’s nature, as
we find him in today’s

we a right to hold strong feelings against such in-
ferences? Emphatically, yes! Psychologically we
are defending our right to be identified as human
beings, not as lower animals, with no ifs, ands, or
buts. It is necessary to further consider in an objec-
tive, fair way, the factors that have caused us to be
labeled in the lower animal class, as mere “‘animals’’
(with derogatory overtones), by some. These peo-
ple apparently lack adequate insight into the mec-
hanisms that cause all human beings to function the
way they do. First, we have offended our former
society. We've broken their rules, regulations, and
customs. We have erred—some of us purposely,
some of us unintentionally, or because of those ever-
existing, extenuating circumstances. There are those
who have performed their misdeeds in a heinous

whatever the case, the
processing and production
of this higher animal-pro-
duct continues, though so
slowly, that we are justi-
fied in considering man’s
present status in the pres-
ent-day world as station-
ary, for all practical pur-
poses.

Let’s consider, momentarily, the prisoner's rela-
tionships to portions of the introductory paragraphs.
Prisoners are certainly a part of humankind, regard-
less of any contrary ideas that some folks hold. As
such, we are part and parcel of this product produced
by a Master Craftsman, or nature. We are, in fact,
some of the Craftsman’s own special handiwork,
even though we exist in this present prisoner cate-
gory. Prisoners are not, however, to be classed as
one of the species of lower animal life. Usually the
prisoner resents the “animal label,’ and whenever
this is implied our ego is injured, thus causing us to
become aroused to anger. Remember, we were not
born into these circumstances—this evolved, as the
result of multiple extenuating circumstances. Have

etary assessments called “‘fines.”’ The collection
agency representing our former society is called a
“COURT,” and they are also charged with adminis-
tering its rules. Prisoners must pay with time and/or
money—even their lives in some cases—because our
former society, which is made up of men like our-
selves, and subject to human error, human weak-
nesses, guilt complexes, and guilt reactions, is a so-
ciety that believes essentially, ““An eye for an eye;
a tooth for a tooth.’ The concept is perhaps just, in
a sense, but the “modus operandi” appears to lack
equality, as regards the method of treatment and sen-
tencing for various types of offenses, in a modern so-
ciety which claims to place emphasis on rehabilita-
tion. But this involves another story which is well
