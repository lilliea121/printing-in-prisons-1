beneath asphalt and solidily frozen ground, burst
from the 18 degree temperature. There is but a lim-
ited number of conventional tools for this type of
work, so muscle power and sturdy hand-picks and
shovels were of prime importance. This episode is
not historically significant; Washington never slept
here or anything of that nature, but, from 12 noon
until 3 A.M. the following morning, the “‘Bull Gang’”’
was present in the 18 degree temperature, wearing
8 inch high over-shoes in |1 inches of water, at this
potential underwater safari and mecca for skin
divers. They repaired the break—no fuss, no fan-
fare, just fifty cents per day. Ah, these easy-money
boys. The removal of the soft water tanks, and re-
placing them with new and more modern equipment
is also worthy of mention here.

Many of the procedures in work of this descrip-
tion are becoming more and more mechanized, but
we still need the muscle and an abundance of know-
how. By this | mean that many of the procedures in
this line of work are dependent upon craftsmanship
—human skills and judgments—rather than me-
chanical perfections. The entire crew has to be
aware of and understand the problems at hand; and
with this understanding, to naturally work coopera-
tively, to understand the procedures and problems
of each other, and each must produce his work to
mesh properly with each other. Above all, quality
must be built into a job; it cannot be inspected in
later.

Certain technical authorities made the profound
statement, that in their opinion the replacing of the
tanks with the new system was a physical impos-
sibility. What the job actually amounted to, was an
inpenetrable barrier against which Cap’ Roach and
the “Bull Gang’ could -only struggle hopelessly.
Nevertheless, the impossibility of the situation kicked
off the interest of all concerned. The subterranean
working area was so cramped, that maneuverability
was strictly limited to the n’th degree; this coupled
with the intense heat made the situation a little less
than desirable—a tough, hot, and dirty job per-

formed under the most adverse conditions. Accept-
ed traditional procedures were tried and found want-
ing, even the potential of the crew was not enough
until it was converted into success by stress being
placed on organization, consistency, and above all,
the proper direction coupled with experience, ability
and will. This reflected the mood of the entire crew.
The coup de grace, or the finishing stroke for the en-
tire job was accomplished in approximately 50 work-
ing hours—not bad for a job that was a physical im-
possibility at the start.

In summing up, | don’t think the “Bull Gang” ex-
pects any kudo’s for their efforts—just a nod of rec-
ognition for work well done, plus the realization that
these men are ‘‘long-timers,’? who are supposedly
the hard-core convicts of any correctional institution.
This is the unsound reasoning the uninitiated adopt
when “‘long-timer’” is mentioned. Hard-core con-
victs are not permitted within shouting distance of
the front gate, nor to work outside the gate with one
unarmed overseer, nor are they permitted to roam
freely inside these walls at all hours of the night when
an emergency detail is called. These men of the
‘Bull Gang’’ are long-timers who have been given
the trust of working outside these walls, and they
value and guard this confidence that has been placed

in them. ©
