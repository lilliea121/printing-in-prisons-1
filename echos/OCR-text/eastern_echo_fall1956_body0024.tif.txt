the story of Slat Dillon, protector of the innocent,
upholder of the law, and pick-up man for Reginelli.
Any resemblance to any persons, living or dead is
purely . - — you should be so lucky!

My name is Sam MacBrew (no relation to
Dangerous Dan McBrew). I was a tall, cool brone
buster in those days. I was a brone buster until
one day someone showed me one of those wild
hosses. . . .who ME??? So, they made me a bar-
keep in the Texas Trail Saloon and from then on
I was known as tall, cool Brew. I never owned a
six-shooter because it was against my religion. My
religion? Oh-ah, I was Yellow. That’s affiliated
with The Brothers of Self-Preservation Funda-
mentalists. And that’s why I’m here today telling
this story. All I ever owned was a fast hoss and
a gee-tar. I had seven notches on the neck of my
gee-tar. (When I wanted to play my gee-tar I
wanted someone to be present, even if I had to
knock them down first.) Today, I’m an old man
with nothing but memories, but I’m happy as a bed-
bug in a public flop house.

Well, as I say, I was working the Texas Trail
Saloon, but it was tough. The owner was always
watching me. He knew I was tapping the till but
he couldn’t catch me at it. I got to admit I was
pretty clever. No one could understand how I
used to make the brass spittoons ring when I spit
at them. When my mouth used to get full of silver
dollars I used to spit them into the spittoon. (One
of my jobs was cleaning out the spittoons in the
morning.) The boss used to think I kept a plug
of Horse Hoof in my mouth. Today they have
Old Age Pensions but in those days you had to
put a little something by if you lived to an old age.

I was happy at Dodge City. I had a good room
at the Dodge House, a room with - - well, not a view
but a fine aroma from the livery stable. My only
claim to fame is that I knew Slat Dillon, U. S.
Marshal, Kitty, B-girl at the Texas Trail and
Chester Slewfoot, Dillon’s deputy. Kitty and Slat
were married then and living peacefully - - between
bouts.

Kitty was quite a gal in those days. She had
been on more laps than a napkin at Del Monico’s
hashhouse, and she could smile prettier with her

three teeth than most girls would with a full set. «:

... ‘They went thatta-way, Herschell”’

Murphy’s Matzo Balls, we brmg you Sun Smoke

She could toss her garter from the top of the bar
and hang it like a halo on some bald head and spit
a plug of tobacco smack dab in the middle of it.
She was an iron-willed woman. She had so much
iron in her she used to take anti-rust shots. She was
a large bosomed gal who always seemed to be stand-
ing closer to you than you were to her. I always
suspicioned her of carrying a couple of Colt 44’s in
her bosom...never did find out, though.

Dillon first met Katty in Tombstone where she
was known as Kitty, Girl Mole. She had the grave
digging concession on Boot Hill.

I was there when Slat Dillon was first appointed
U. 8S. Marshal for the Kansas Territory and I was
there when they stripped him of his Star. The
Government never got around to sending him his
silver star so he had to wear the trademark of
Mother Murphy’s Matzo Balls, a six-pointed star
from the boxtop, pinned to his vest. He lost his star
for shooting the father of ten children --- mistook
him for a rabbit. He lost his star but ole’ Doe saved
the man’s life. Ole’ Doe was always doing something
fine. Every morning he would go over to Dillon’s
home, open the cellar and throw a few fish to the
children. The kids loved Ole’ Doc. To show their
appreciation they would playfully give him a blast
or two from a 12 gauge shotgun.

Not many people know that ole’ Doc was famous
back east in Shapeless, Mass. He was the inventor
of that famous do-it-yourself-kit ‘“Brain Surgery at
Home for Beginners’’. However, hard times befell
the good doctor, and he was forced into smuggling
minor league ball players into Philadelphia. This
was frowned upon and he fled west to avoid Bob
Carpenter and remained here.

One day I was behind the bar painting a model
in the nude, but I hurriedly put on a robe when I
heard footsteps in the cellar. At first I thought it
was the real estate agent trying to collect rent from
the rats but instead in stepped Dillon, Kitty, Chester
and Doe. It seems the local Captain Ferguson was
making it tough on pick-up men and Dillon had to
crawl in cellar windows and climb over back fences
to make his contacts. While he was there I gave
him a play. Told him to box 742 for seven cents.

They lined up at the bar and we all had a
round of cherry phosphates. We chewed the rag—
or rather Chester did, he’s wild over the damp bar
rags—and one thing leading to another it wasn’t
long before the damp stuff on the bar rag was telling
on Chester. You could see he was stuffed fuller than
Elsa Maxwell’s stockings. His tongue loosened and
