-You, officer, stop at the registrar's desk and a Grant will be waiting.

. (interrupting silence) So, in spite of my warning you have committed an untruth. Do you

want to become a monster?

. Apparently the suspect is a victim of far greater moral deterioration than we had realized. .

. (interrupting) If you don’t mind, as the mediator here, I'll decide the suspect's condition.

So far, I see two adjustments to be made. Anton, do you have anything to add?

No. Yes, there is, I wish to correct the untruth. I am married.

.Ah, now we are making progress. Anton are you happily married?

No, the last two years have been miserable, nothing but nag, nag, nag.

is there an extra-marital complication?

Oh no, it’s just that | can’t stand any more nagging.

I want to talk to
In the meanwhile you, gentlemen, are excused for lunch.

Mrs. Mobisc.

Anton Mobisc and the remaining officer dine at the sumptuous cafeteria in the Justice Building; when they

return to the consultation room they find that Mrs. Mobisc is already seated and apparently quite agitated.

Welcome gentlemen.

.Now there is the problem of restitution to the complainant.

I trust that you enjoyed your lunch. I am told that the bean soup

is excellent. If the lady has no objection you may smoke.

Marya. .. Why did you do it?

. Well, Anton, | just don’t know how to begin. .

Perhaps I can be of assistance. Anton Mobisc you and your wife are physical, cultural

and moral opposites, therefore, entirely incompatible. Mrs. Mobisc has indicated to me that
she wishes to terminate your relationship. It was she who supplied the information to the
officers, to save you from yourself.

I am shocked, but if she wishes termination, so be it.

] have spoken to Astra Belle
on the audio-viz and since her property has been returned to her she is willing to settle for
the nominal rental fee, which is 1% of Total-Val. If you do not have this amount it will

be deducted from your Insurance Fund. Do you have anything further to add?

I wish to unburden myself. It was an impulse which came over me apparently because

of my marital conflict.

.l am going to recommend that you, Anton, take a vacation to the planet Venus. The sooth-

ing atmosphere will do much to restore your peace of mind. Your marriage-termination
certificate will be awaiting you at the registrars desk. Good luck, or should I say good
hunting >?

I want to commend you officers on a job well done. Mrs. Mobisc, thank you for your co-
operation, and good luck to you. You people are model citizens who have enabled me to
make the proper adjustments.
