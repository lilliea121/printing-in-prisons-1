When the smoke cleared, the doctor was sitting
on the floor, cross-legged, picking wax from his ear
with the point of his sword. The two coffee house

raiders were busy taking Pink Pills for Pale People,
trying to overcome the effects of my furious smok-
ing, while I stood there paring my nails with my
automatic nail parer.

“Son,” the doctor began in an eesti A tone
of voice, “what is it that you want from life?”

“Oh, Sir,” I replied, “if you would only grant me
permission to beg for alms on the Catherdal steps,
just so I could get enough money to market my
Smokeless Tobacco.”

Pilola tas unenes Viave, ne said. (Ele liked: bo
use Sailor talk ever since he had a ride on the Jersey
City Ferry.) “Did you say ‘smokeless tobacco’?”

Ce leceplicd: sour chew. tte

After five minutes of silence, broken only by the
orinding of the doctor’s teeth, (quite a difficult feat,
considering he had no lowers) the doctor fired a look
in my direction, and in a highly educated, well-modu-
lated tone of voice, said, “Listen you creep, I'd lke
to throw a scorpion on ya, but I’m going to try once
more. Have you ever had any hobbies?”

“Sure,” I said. (I was looking at him slyly—I
always look slyly in psychiatric offices.) “I like to
hunt and drink,” I carefully admitted.

With a slight falter in his voice he said, “I know
I’m a fool for asking, but WHAT do you hunt?

At that precise moment the falling of ion bell
began to toll. It was unable to whistle, so it just had
to Fol It was summoning the domestics to lunch.
Throwing the whip and chair down the mail chute,
Doe turned to me and inquired as to what I would
like for lunch.

“A wild duck dinner,” I replied.

“We have no wild duck, Son,” he apologized,
“but we could take a tame one and irritate it for
WOU ”

Being head of his department, I guess they tried
to fulfill his every wish, so I said SO) ioy UUEE he,”
(The duck, I mean.) He was the head ole his depart-
ment alright, but I had seen better heads on umbrel-
las. He looked at me queerly for a minute, then said,

‘What did you just say, Cousin?”

“Oh, nothing,” I replied. He wasn’t going to get
anything on me. He didn’t know that I had learned
how to say “Not Guilty” long before I learned “Ma-
ma” or Pa-pa,” or even wave by-bye.”

We finally settled for a steak apiece, and when
IT mentioned that I had eaten better steaks for bad
behavior, he replied, “If I had a horse I would horse-
whip you.” (We remained silent for one minute out
of respect for that last joke which had just died.)

After a brief interlude a startled look came in-
to his eyes—not uncommon to psychiatrists. He then
pointed his finger at me. (It was then that I noticed
he had the full ten fingers like everyone else, only he
had eight on one hand and two on the other. “Say,”
he inquired, “aren’t you the one I had in here last
vear for throwing Black Widow Spiders into the Ma-
ternity Ward of the Orphan’s Hospital?”

Eastern Echo

I laughingly confessed to this boyish prank and
also told him about how I fell from a sixty-foot lad-
der and never received a scratch. The good doctor
squinted at me for a full two minutes, cleared his
throat, placed the merest hint of cologne behind both
ears, put a .38 revolver on his desk and said, “O.K.,
Cousin, why weren’t you hurt after falling from a
sixty-foot ladder?”

I replied that I had been standing only on the

first rung. (The doctor vomited.) I ducked real
quickly as one of the coffee house raiders attempted
to give me another friendly pat. Trying to change
the subject, I said, “I don’t mind being here, for it’s
been only a short time ago that another psychiatrist
cured me of a terrible fear I had about answering the
telephone when it would ring. (If it didn’t ring, I
wouldn’t worry about answering it.) In just a few
visits I was completely cured. Now I can answer the
phone if it rings or not. I got so I liked telephoning
so much, that even when I took a bath, I always gave
the tub aring.” (This time one of the raiders laugh-
ingly kicked me three or four times. )
“Cousin,” he said, “I’m tired. I keep long hours here.
I’m up at dawn every morning to see the sun rise.”
(I interrupted him here to tell him he couldn’t have
picked a better time to see the sun rise.)

He was close to the breaking point now. He
said, “Dear friend, why, O why, didn’t you take up a
hobby, like riding in subways, or perhaps you could
have taken up folk dancing—anything except throw-
ing poisonous bugs around. I told him that I was
eraterful for his analysis, but that riding in subways
gives me sinus trouble, and folk dancing was out be-
cause I have never seen a folk. “So,” I continued,
“vou can take those suggestions, cut them up in small
pieces and sell them as mandolin picks.”

“Cousin of mine,” the doctor said, as he spit at
me and missed, “were you ever sick?” I informed
him that I had the usual children’s diseases: Mumps
when I was 46 years old and Measels at 48. “Ah, I
see,” he said, “were you in the Army, dear chum?”

Of ag, > 7 replied.

“Fine,” said he, “who’s side were you on?”

This aroused my ire (O get me!) and I reached
for a book that was near at hand to throw at him.
But at the last second I noticed it was a rare first
edition to the Sears-Roebuck Catalogue. I held my
fire.

Yes, today I am a beaten man, a poor man. I
only have a little garden snake for a companion.
Yes, he or she (whatever the case may be) is a poor
snake, too; for he or she (whatever the case may be)
hasn’t even got a pit to hiss in. In the words of that
eoreat horseman, Paul Revere, at the end of his fam-
ous ride he said, “Whoa!” So it’s about time that I
gach WW In@z.,” OO.

I’m up here now at the State Funny Farm. It’s
not too bad, a little dull at times (in fact it’s so dull,
that one day the tide ran out and never returned, )
but I feel fine. ’m taking a new tranquilizer pill; it’s
called “Dammital.” There are about twenty lady
patients here and I am forever chasing them, only I
just can’t seem to remember what to do with them
after I catch them.
