But;

When

Still;

For;

In search of my soul | go now.

| To find what | have missed,

In search of the love that has left me,
To the child that once was kissed.

In search of the soul | go now,
To find what | have lost,
To try to forget my misery,

And know not what this madness has cost.

Searching, searching, searching,
Now my heart is pained,

For | have lost my heart to hell,
And nothing | have gained.

Of our long incarceration.

There will be no hesitation

Medication

Exportation of sedation to the Russian population,
Where dialectic deviation surely ends in liquidation,

Would result in relaxation of the present situation.

Salvation for the nation must be found in medication!
Religious meditation on transubstantiation

Can be an inspiration, but who needs transfiguration

Salvation for the nation can be found in medication?
Psychiatric consultation leads us to accultuation,

Thence to rehabilitation, which in turn means commutation

Salvation for the nation will be found in medication.
Please excuse my iteration when | speak of medication,
‘tis my fondest aspiration to indulge to satiation.

And, in ‘Free Association”, when | answer, “Medication”,

Salvation for the nation only lies in medication!

Searching

Reprint from the Harmony
Mass. Women’s Corr. Inst.

In search of my soul | go now,
There must be another fate,

Even this world as | know it,
Could not leave me so full of hate.

To find a new tomorrow,

To never know the past,

To find a love, a faith, a tree.
To find a thing to last.
