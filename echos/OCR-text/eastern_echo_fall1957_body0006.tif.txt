How Progressive

PROGRESSIVE Penology @

Although the proponents of ‘‘progressive’’
penology can point with pride at the visible benefits
of their system, in the form of classification centers,
staff boards, trade schools, libraries, athletic facili-
ties, and the generally improved treatment of in-
mates, the above question is still valid. Yes, there
is progress—but in what direction? What has been
and will be accomplished other than improving the
living conditions within our prisons? Don’t mis-

promise. WHY??? Many answers are given in
response to this question—lack of personnel, lack of
proper training, not enough time to show results,
progress is being made, ete., etc., ete., according to
the man questioned. However, I believe its main
failing lies in the ironic fact that in many of the
social sciences of today, penology included, the man
has been forgotten and the many and voluminous
tests, charts, surveys of living conditions, and other
records have become the final all. Despite the pro-
tests of the ‘‘progressive’’ penologist that his science
or system is based on the individual and not the
group, it is my personal opinion that the cruel,
physical impersonality of strict custodial treatment
