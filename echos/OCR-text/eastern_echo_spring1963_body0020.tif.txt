Regardless of how or by whom jazz is defined, the
term “improvisation” will enter the definition. It is
the one distinguishing feature of jazz. Modern classi-
cal music will employ syncopation, flattened thirds
and sevenths and still not be jazz. It is improvisa-
tion, also, that separates jazz from the popular music
of the stage, screen, and juke box. Most popular
music today is closer to classical music than to jazz.
Popular music can be closely compared to the “‘light
classical’’ selections or the musical comedy numbers
that add filler and popularity to many band and or-
chestral programs.

As the playing musician advances and undertakes
more advanced music, the borderline into jazz will
be crossed. Today, jazz compositions fall into sev-
eral categories. There is “Dixieland” in which the
members of the band jointly improvise around the
melody and where individual members take impro-
vised solos. There is modern, small ensemble jazz
(trio to septet) in which the theme is stated by all
instruments (frequently in unison) and then an im-
provised solo is taken by two or more members of
the ensemble. The number is completed by a re-
statement of the theme. Finally there is big band
jazz which closely resembles the ensemble format
with the exception that it is much more completely
arranged with introductions, themes, interlude ma-
terial, coda, and solo space of a determined length
allowed to several of the instruments.

The question arises as to how improvisation can
be taught or developed. In order to answer that ques-
tion a brief discussion of the nature of improvisation
is necessary.

**To improvise’ means generally to perform in an
impromptu manner or without previous preparation.
A closer look at the term “‘improvisation’”’ as it is ap-
plied to jazz, would reveal that there are several
ways in which it can be applied. The improvised
chorus can remain close to the melody with the only
changes being in the time values and rhythmic posi-
tioning of the notes. The performer can go a step

further and change some of the notes or phrases in
the melody. In going this far the performer has not
really improvised or played something new and of
his own spontaneous creation. To improvise in the
fullest sense, the performer will leave the melody en-
tirely and concern himself with the chord progres-
sions upon which the original melody was built. He
will create a new melody using the chords of the pa-
rent melody as a point of departure. This type of
improvisation or composition can be completely on
the spur of the moment, or it can be the result of
partial predetermination in so far as the notes are
played in a certain order since they are part of an
arpeggio, scale or riff pattern that has been worked
out or learned previously. Some performers possess
the ability to improvise without depending upon
such automatic responses, but rather they have the
inborn ability to play the changes without thinking
out what they are doing. Such individuals have al-
ready taken great steps on the road to improvisation.
His art can be improved with playing and listening
experience and with the study of the theoretical as-
pects of improvisation. This situation is similar to the
natural talent of the painter who possesses creative
ability that can be refined, directed, and developed.
Other musicians can, by a study of the theory of im-
provisation, gain some dexterity in this matter. They
can reach the point where they can produce a tech-
nically correct artifact. It is jazz improvisation, but
it lacks the spark of genius or creativity to make it
great jazz. The more the musician listens, studies,
and copies, the better his product will become. A
great many soloists today fall into this category,
just as a great many painters produce enjoyable,
technically correct, if uninspired works.

The musician should be encouraged along these
lines as he will progress and will be creating original
works of art which carry with them the internal sat-
isfaction of creation. ome ees

The following is an outline of a method that could
be followed by the musician as he attempts to grasp
the technical tools of improvisation. The ability to
use these techniques can only come from experience
in improvising—and the ideas must come from the
originality and artistic ability of the musician:

|. He should know and memorize all major and
minor scales; be able to play them successive-
ly around the cycle of keys or chromatically.

2. He should have a theoretical knowledge of
intervals, their names and alterations; know
what is meant by a major, minor, diminished
or augmented 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 7th; by a
perfect, diminished, or augmented 4th and

5th.
