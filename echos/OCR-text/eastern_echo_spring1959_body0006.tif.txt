MISGUIDED MISSILES

by FRANK H. TERRES

ecent editorial campaigns by local papers, are
R “blasting off” with attacks upon our state lead-

ers in connection with paroles and commuta-
tions awarded inmates of our state and county penal
institutions. The missiles are launched from their
pads, week after week, to explode upon our citizenry
with a shower of hot, angry words, developed in the
laboratories of the scientists so-skilled in the manu-
facture of misconeceiving phraseology and half-truths.
The assumptions are based on supposition, and the
implications are phrased as questions. Thus, they
escape legal retaliation, and at the same time, plant
the seeds of suspicion upon the actions of our state
officials. This method of clever distortion is easily
penetrated by the informed. However, to the unin-

formed who may be emotionally seeking a scapegoat
for the local crime situation, it can be a dangerous
source of information.

If you will read the editorials carefully, you
will note that it is difficult to discern their implication.
Is it the individual authorities that are being eriti-
cized, or the State Penal System? Is it their belief
that the Governor, Attorney General and Pardon
Board are using unwise judgement? Or, is it the be-
lief of the writers that a commutation of sentence
should not be given to anyone, in any instance, at any
time? Perhaps it is the political belief of the state
officials that is being attacked. Whatever the intent,
the articles are without justification.
