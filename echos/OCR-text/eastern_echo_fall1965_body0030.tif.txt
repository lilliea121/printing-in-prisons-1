dent economically. We have every reason to believe
that this program will prove to be most successful in
aiding inmates here at SCIPHA as well as at all other

institutions in our state.

No man will ever be a big executive who feels that
he must, either openly or under cover, follow up every
order he gives and see that it is done—nor will he ever
develop a capable assistant.

Vocational Rehabilitation (con’d)
cently. announced that a National record of about
135,000 people rehabilitated also was established in
the same year.

To qualify for services from the Pennsylvania Bur-
eau of Vocational Rehabilitation and other State rehab-
ilitation agencies, an applicant must have a physical
or mental disability that prevents him from working.
Another requirement is thathe must be of working age.

Applicanis for services are interviewed by a rehab-
ilitation counselor. If accepted, they are given a med-
ical examination, trained for and placed in a job. All
of the services are free if the applicant cannot afford
to pay.

In order to become adjusted to life in the commu-
nity after his release, it is very important for a prison-
er to get personal advice from someone interested in
helping him find a job. The rehabilitation counselor
is indispensable in providing this service.

For further details about the Pennsylvania program,
inmates of the State Correctional Institution at Phila-
delphia should see the parole officer.

As for the problem nationally: Certainly, disabled
prisoners are among the most difficult persons to re-
habilitate for employment. In the first place, they
have a physical or mental handicap. They also have
a criminal record. Many employers hold the record,
even more than the handicap, against them.

As one prisoner put it in a poll at Atlanta, Georgia:
‘When you ask for a job, one of the first questions
they ask is, ‘‘Have you ever been in any trouble?”’

3ecause ofthe special problems of disabled prison-
ers, the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration has
invested almost $1,000,000 in 18 research projects to
find ways of rehabilitating more such individuals.

Oklahoma was the first State to provide intensive
services for public offenders through studies of this
nature. Since 1961, the State has been carrying on a
project at its reformatory for disabled young inmates.

In a more recent Oklahoma project, services have
been provided for many prisoners in the State’s peni-
tentiary system. Nineteen persons released from one

28

prison in a recent year were prepared and placed for
in jobs.

In a different type of project at Montefiore Hospital
in New York City, plastic surgeons are removing tat-
toos and scars from prisoners. The researchers be-
lieve that by improving a prisoner’s physical appear-
ance he will regain confidence in himself and be more
likely to qualify for and hold a job after his release

In addition to research projects to increase prison-
ers opportunities for employment, some States are ex-
panding disabled prisoner rehabilitation programs.
This is particularly true in Georgia, Arkansas, and
Washington State.

But, no matter how much money is spent or how
much job preparation is offered to former prisoners,
the ultimate decision to work must be made by the in-
dividual himself. It takes courage for a person con-
victed of a crime—especially if he has the added dis-
advantage of disability—to train for and hold a job.
Nevertheless, we have seen it done even by men with
long criminal records.

Those of us in vocational rehabilitation believe
that many disabled prisoners are willing to work and
have the capacity to hold a job. As one prisoner has
expressed it, there still are many employers who will
hire a man on the basis of ability and not his past.

POINTERS FOR WRITERS

Five points of advice to practitioners seeking to
improve their performance in related types of writing:

1. Edit, revise, and rewrite your copy (not just once
or twice, but many times).

2. Show your copy to someone else.

3. Don’t be sensitive about having your copy edited.

4. Continually collect and store information from
your reading.

5. Be committed to your assignment.

The better and more experienced you are, the more
likely you are to ponder what you’ve written——to edit
it, revise, perhaps rewrite it. You look at your copy
critically, as though you had never seen it before, as
though someone else had written it——someone you

don’t like very much.

Being sensitive about your copy is a characteris-
tic of amateur writers. Anyone who is sensitive about
having copy changed——who defends copy on principle
——-is being unprofessional. Everyone in the writing
business, from the best to the least, has his copy edit-
ed. A writer can improve both his disposition and his

performance if he adjusts to this fact.
