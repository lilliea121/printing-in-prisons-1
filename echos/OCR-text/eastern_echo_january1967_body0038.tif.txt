AA Shindig

On Monday, Nov. 28, 1966, the
A. A. Group of our institution held
its fifth anniversary meeting in the
movie hall at 6:30 P.M. We had
quite a gathering at the meeting. Be-
sides all the members of the A. A.
Group from the institution, we were
honored to have many outside guests.
Our humble thanks go to the 33 men
from outside for giving us their time
and consideration in attending our
meeting. The first outside speaker,
Mr. Joe McC., started things going
pretty good, then our second outside
speaker, Mr. Frank C., had the whole
place cracking up with his stories
and jokes. Everything was in full
swing and going great. We all were
having a good time kidding and
cutting up. Then the bomb fell! Mr.
Barclay, our Music Director, had the
band play ‘‘China Doll’ which, al-
though done very nicely, sort of left
a flat feeling in the air. Something
like “How Dry I Am” or ‘One For
My Baby and One More For The
Road’’ would have been more in
keeping with the mood everyone was
in. But outside of that one flaw, our
fifth anniversary meeting was a
smashing success enjoyed by every-
one. We had coffee and doughnuts
later and very good coffee it was.
