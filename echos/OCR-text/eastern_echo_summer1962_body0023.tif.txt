If a man is eternally committed to the practice
of predacity in one form or another to achieve some
measure of gratification for the infinitely complex
variety of desires which assail him, is it the destiny
of society to inevitably yield to so vicious a law?
Yes. This is the nature of things. But to submit

the extent of imagination men display in raising the

material circumstances of every single human being,

in every nook and crevice of society; in altering the
conditions of his envircnment so as to bring unsocial
conditions to an irreducible minimum; in modifying
those moral sanctions which attempt to restrict the
healthy instincts of man—just in that proportion

And this is the measure
of his ignorance of the operative forces which impel
him. Perhaps many more hundreds of years will
have to unfold before man becomes sufficiently
scientific to waive sacrosanct precepts of morality
and turn away from what he cannot ever hope to
alter, and concentrate his efforts upon those things
that lie within his powers to change—his environ-
ment. Until the challenge, posed by the knowledge
of what man really is, fires his imagination sufficien-
tly, man cannot feel the need for the dynamic
changes in the economic and social structure of his
environment so necessary for what is commonly re-
ferred to as a ‘healthy society.’’ But it is a harsh
truth that where there are socio-economic imbalances
as exist in our society, and where men are without the
necessary tools or opportunities to provide for them-
selves adequately within the social orbit, there is no
limit to the effort they will make to secure what they
regard as necessary to their subsistance outside of it.
Again in a society such as ours, where countless net-
works of moral structures limit the flow of healthy in-
stincts, there is no end to the distortions or a limit to
the violence the human animal will display to assert
its power simply ta ke. Think on it!

Meanwhile, crime continues unabated, and
those festering, poverty ridden, down-trodden areas
which pock-mark the face of society remain untouch-
ed by human hands, to spawn another generation of
criminals and to provide stomping grounds for the
present crop.

‘‘The Greeks studied man and the laws of life as they found them. And
they realized profoundly, as we have forgotton—to the negation of life—that
virtue consists not in denying the nature of man, but in so developing all ele-
ments of it into such an efficient, beautiful and harmonious whole that of his

life each (man) creates a work of art.”
