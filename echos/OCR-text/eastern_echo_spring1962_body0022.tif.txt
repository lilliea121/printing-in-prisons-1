From Our Ghaplains....

Better to Light One Candle

Rev. Sidney E. Barnes

Protestant Chaplain

Every inmate at one time or another has heard the
phrase: “Don’t tell me your troubles, go see the
Chaplain...” It is a phrase used by some to express
contempt and/or annoyance towards anyone who
talks about his problems—or even admits that he
has any.

The phrase also reveals a warped conception of the
Chaplain and his work. Some have the idea that the
Chaplain is for ecry-babies who are looking for sym-
pathy, or that the Chaplain is one who doles out
moral advice and pious admonitions. To some he is
a well-meaning “sky pilot” who is not in touch with
harsh reality.

Dow elieve me. 5

How to deseribe the Chaplain’s work, then? First,
he is a minister who has had special training in pas-
toral counseling and the ministry in institutions. He
is a pastor who seeks to help a man to help himself. . .
through counseling to help a man understand him-
self and his particular problems in the hght of God’s
Judgement, Love, and Forgiveness.

We hasten to confess: the Chaplain is an imperfect
man himself. He is a sinner among sinners who de-
pends upon God’s help in the conduct of his ministry
to others. He does not pretend to render final judg-
ment upon members of hiso flock; he rather works
towards the end that men will judge themselves in
the ight of God’s claim of every life. The Chaplain
does not pretend that this or any other institution is
perfect . far from it. He does suggest that im-
perfect facilities are not the greatest obstacle to re-
habilitation. It is rather something within a man,
something which the Bible calls, “hardness of heart.”
So: Better to light one candle than to do nothing
save curse the darkness.

The Chaplain points to One who, if truly received
and trusted, provides a transforming power which
can enlighten and change a man’s life on every level.

Let us be lighting a few candles for our souls.

Sincere Worship is Enduring

Fr. John J. McHugh

Catholic Chaplain

A newspaper was running a competition to dis-
cover the most principled, sober, well-behaved local
citizen. Among the entries came one which read: “T
don’t smoke, touch intoxicants or gamble. I am faith-
ful to my wife and never look at another woman. I
am hard-working, quiet and obedient. I never go to
the movies or attend the theater and I go to bed
early every night and rise with the dawn. I attend
Chapel regularly every Sunday without fail. I’ve
been like this for the past three years. But wait un-
til next Spring, when they let me out of here.”

Although this anecdote was intended for a humor-
ous vein, it has its counterpart too often in reality.
It is a bitter disappointment and sometimes frustrat-
ing to Chaplains to learn from a “repeater” that he
has neglected his religious duties.

This is especially true when an inmate apparently
showed sincere interest while “doing time.” But let’s
look at the over-all picture. As far as the religious
program in penal institutions is concerned it isn’t
too difficult for an inmate to conform. Most authori-
ties co-operate with the Chaplains and even en-
courage religious participation. Unfortunately the
facilities are not always ideal. Nevertheless, the dis-
tance to a Chapel is usually slight; there is never a
collection; there is no concern for proper dress; in
some cases it offers an opportunity to beat the lock
and, besides it looks good for the record. All in all,
not too much sacrifice is required.

On the other hand, let’s consider the experiences in
a free society. No block officer is present to remind
one of services; a long distance might have to be
traveled; proper attire is expected; a contribution to
the collection is required and domestic problems
might add to the difficulty. Still, if a person has dis-
covered the real meaning and value of worship, no
sacrifice 1s too great.

Inasmuch as many come from irreligious back-
grounds and return to the same, it is encouraging to
hear that some remain steadfast. Considering the
