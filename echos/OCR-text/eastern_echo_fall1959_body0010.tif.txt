haven.” Another book, “We Who Are About To Die,” by David Lanson, who
spent 13 months in San Quentin’s death row, followed in their wake.

Prison writers, not unlike their outside counterparts, often wonder whether
the rejected material they send to a magazine is read. Notwithstanding the occa-
sional one-man inefficient operations, Aron M. Mathieu, business manager of the
Writer’s Digest says, “It is the law of competition (rather than any sense of fair
play or cordiality to an unknown) that assures each writer a fair hearing.”

In explaining the reasoning behind this principle, Mathieu points out that each
editorial shop employs article and fiction editors, with each having their staff of
two or more assistants. The assistant has but one way to keep his job and to ad-
vance. “He needs to discover in the morning mail,’’ Mathieu said, “a manuscript,
sell it to his own editor, who in turn has to sell it to his own editor-in-chief. If the
printed matter,” he continued, “pulls fan mail, is quoted and reprinted, and gener-
ally pushes the magazine ahead, then the assistant who found the manuscript, goes
up the line; assuming he does this with some regularity. He is not unlike a base-
ball talent scout. Find new talent or get a new job, are his standing orders.”

Adding with re-assurance, he said, “The American way of competition and
the unknown editorial staff assistant assure every manuscript not only of a hearing,
but a prejudiced hearing; prejudiced insofar as your first reader is rooting to find
something to stake his judgment on.”

In some prisons, according to Mr. Spector, where the educational program is
mature and broad, the setting up of classes in creative writing has encouraged the
development of new talent. “The publication of prison magazines to give novice
writers the prestige of even a limited audience,” he observes, “has further stimu-
lated writing.”

As an example, the librarian points with pride to the CANDLE of the Wiscon-
sin State Prison. Regularly including stories by inmates, it is published as part of
the institution’s educational program and the University of Wisconsin Extension
Department. “Many well-managed prisons,’ he explains, “have arrived at the
conviction that time spent in planning and writing helps both inmate and
prison, for a prisoner pounding away at a typewriter for hours . . . 1s too busy
to dig a tunnel under the walls, or fashion bludgeons for use in a riot. Creative
writing,’ he counsels, “is not considered a cure-all, but an occupation which, de-
manding self-discipline and criticism, may help to develop these needed qualities in
tS RACHIOMERS,

Little of the fiction written in prison is of professional quality. The defects
are rather typical of all tyros—wordiness, straining for effect, plot-lacking and
over-sentimentality. However, as Mr. Spector points out, “with the sophistication
of the writers increasing, inmate fiction shows a promising breadth of subject
and attitude.”

Mr. Spector goes on to say, however, “Fiction can avoid the contentious, but
by that token it cannot satisfy the prisoner’s mind, which dwells on controversy.
From the moment of arrest,” he explains, “he is engaged in dispute with implacable
authority, too often for his happiness a losing battle. He has much to fight for
—hetter prisons, shorter terms, easier probation and parole—and he feels too puny
and mute in the uneven match,” he poignantly observes.

As every conscientious prison administrator knows, discontent festers when
it can not be expressed openly, and infects the whole prison population. Conversely,
as our benefactor points out, “open talk of prisoner’s rights and problems gives
men the hope that somehow their troubles will be understood, and something will
be done to right the cruder wrongs.” Acting on this theory, he adds, “some of the
less hide-bound prison administrators have allowed inmates—in their journals—to
hack away editorially at the laws and philosophies which seem to them unbearably
harsh, and to plump for improvements they want. Articles that speak constructively
on these subjects,” he asserts with a degree of certainty, “for the inarticulate mass
of inmates, are the real meat of prison journalism. They are widely read, he
emphasized, “discussed and reprinted even in the more prudently edited papers.”

Unfortunately, comparatively few publications dare to wage the battle for their
hapless brethern. But those that do, make many and persistent sorties across the
distant span of the bridge of understanding.
