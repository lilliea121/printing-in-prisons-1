Snoopy Finds a Wreath

Another one of those little gulps in life that
occasionally overtakes all of us happened to Snoopy
last Veterans’ Day. Musing over his own canine
universe, he was interrupted in his thoughts by
former editor, Joe Corvi.

‘‘Have you been up on Center, lately, Snoopy ?”’

““No, why?’’ wondered ‘Snoopy. ‘““What’s up
on Center?”

“Nell sald Cory. — lk you trot right up,
you'll see something that never happened before.
And never would have, if it weren’t for the kind

of man Mr. Banmiller is!”

Intrigued, Snoopy four-footed it to the Center

. and that is when he gulped.

Warden Banmiller had cared enough to ee a
handsome wreath over the large plaque honoring
the many former inmates who gave their lives in
defense of this country.

Zietz Rhymes with Zeitz

So many of the men here at Eastern have been
mispronouncing the name of one of the subs on the
Reliable A. C. Softball Team that Snoopy, as an act
of charity, agreed to help rectify the matter.
Second-string outfielder Harry Zietz’s name rhymes
with bites, as in the expression, ‘‘Bites there a dog
with soul so dead, who never to himself has said,
‘I love you for detrimental reasons.’ ”’

says, ‘‘I can’t understands it. They puts the s’s on
my names, and everybodys knows you don’t talks
that ways.’’

And with that, he scratched his noses in

consternations!

37 years old, with 11 years served for a crime
he did not commit, Aaron Treetop Turner was re-
leased by Court Order the morning of June 19th.
The big man was nattily dressed, soft-spoken and
courteous in leaving, but Snoopy discerned the sub-
dued tremor and uneven breathing.

‘Did you ever give up hope?”’ he asked Tree-

top.

‘No, not really,’’ the gentleman replied, ‘‘but
I was convicted and sentenced to death five times
with nine dates of execution set, and a lot of times
I wished I was dead. I laid over at Holmesburg
for 10 years awaiting the chair. It was torment day
and night.’’ .

Snoopy cut the interview short out of respect
for a man who had somehow held up through 11
years of hell. Aaron’s control during what must
have been an emotion-fraught experience involving
both joy and anxiety in being dressed and signed out,
was a thing to admire. After all, it is not everyday
a man passes from death to life...

According to Dave Howard, absolutely nothing!
Story goes like this:

Seems Dave was. sitting in the living room of a
house in Woodbury, New Jersey. On the north side
of the room, looking out on the Jersey Turnpike, is
a sheer drop of some 20-22 feet; thus Dave was
genuinely flabbergasted to surprise a man in a uni-
form looking at him through the window. —Im-
