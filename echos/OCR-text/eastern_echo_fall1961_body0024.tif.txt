The

‘Structure of Success

There is an old saw about three blind men who
were taken to ‘“‘see’’ an elephant for the first time.
The first blind man, using his hands as eyes, grasped
one of the beast’s thick legs, the second man reach-
ed out and took hold of the animal's large ears,
while the third ran his hands over the trunk. When
asked later what the elephant resembled, the first
man declared that the animal was shaped like a
tree trunk, the second took issue with this answer
and insisted that the elephant was similar to a cab-
bage leaf, while the last of the trio ridiculed both
pictures and swore that the beast was a snake ot
some .-sort.

Each, of course, was wrong in his description,
and even if we were to assemble their descriptions,
we would still not have a full picture of the elephant
for they had all overlooked the animal’s body. In
trying to get a picture of prison labor, we are much
in the position of the man who asked what the ele-
phant resembled. Three distinct groups are ready to
answer the question; society, the inmate, and the
institutions. Each though, have their own views,
touching on minor points of prison labor, and all
ignoring the “‘body.”’

The average institution regards its inmate la-
bor as something to keep the inmate busy and out of
mischief; considering the possibility of constructve-
ness as an added bonus. The inmate tends to view
it as something that will pass the time away, enable
himself to earn tobacco money, and perhaps, as a
useful vocation upon release. The outside world—
society— looks upon productive institutional em-
ployment as a threat to both manufacturer and free
labor. All three have failed to see the whole picture.

The labor performed by our institutional in-
mates can be an asset to the community, the insti-
tution, and the inmate, provided iit is carefully
controlled, and respected. Until these last few years,
prison labor has consisted of road gangs, license
plate factories, and small plants that filled some of
the needs of the institution that contained them.
With the advance of penology we now know that an
adequate vocational program is as much a part of
treatment as are therapy and education. Yet, these
enlightened views are useless without direct appli-
cation by the three groups mentioned. Incorporating
the major points of the preceding articles, we can
lay the foundation for a successful vocational struc-
ture if each group will make the following contribu-

tions:
