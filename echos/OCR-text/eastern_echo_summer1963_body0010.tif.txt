Except for a handful of professionals, crime is a
fearful, emotionally unrewarding business and few of
the men who engage in it entertain any real illusions
about it. Beyond its use as a means of attaining
that elusive windfall at the end of the rainbow, the
game in itself holds no significance. If it is anything,
it is primarily an instrument of survival. You may
study it, draw and quarter it, lisp its emotional basis,
strain over the neurosis of it; it yields little more than
that. As for men charged with sex offenses, they
are a breed apart and entirely out of the competence
of any “‘correctional’”’ institution. Theirs is a prob-
lem involving the altering of behavior in the presence

It is, however, upon this single corner of the pris-
oner’s life—the most superficial, deceptive part of
him—the correctional system is focused, and it is this
fixation that accomodates the aridity of all its other
listless facilities, i.e. religion, education, psychology,
etc. Many of the unnatural responses characteristic
of the men living under it is a direct consequence.

Psychology has not been a lamp unto the feet of
the correctionalists. All along the miles of correc-

except in a legal or semantic sense, there is no such

mind simply doesn’t exist. Psychology has not kept

This is not a humanistic defect for there is no law,

After the courts have decided to isolate a man
