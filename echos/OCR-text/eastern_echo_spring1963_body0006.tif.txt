Removal of Eastern State Pen Asked by Mayor Tate

Ex-Governor Lawrence
Urged to Turn Site
into Recreational
Genter

by F. A. Murphy

The Eastern State Penitentiary has been doing a
land office business on this corner since |1829. ‘‘Cher-
ry Hill” is a living monument to those sturdy pio-
neer builders, who made quite a STIR when this in-
stitution was completed.

Of course, “Remove the Pen,” is not anything
new. “THEY” have been -promising to demolish,
rebuild, and remove “Cherry Hill’’ (not to be con-
fused with Society Hill) since 1929. At this writing,
452 top brass conferences have been held—135
Official State Banquets—27 political parades, and
nine different administrations have all solemnly
vowed to rid this neighborhood of this unsightly and
dangerous “‘Blot.’’ So what happens? The same
thing that happened to the old maid who wore cot-
ton stockings—NOTHING.

My source of information is relayed to me by an
old newspaper man, who finally discovered there is
little or no money in old newspapers; so he had to
go to work. He is now very active as Vice-President
in-charge-of-leaky-Dixie Cups at City Hall. He in-
forms me that ““They’’ are undecided whether to
sell the institution site or not, because after ‘““They”’

read the agency's advertisement—this site seemed
a good place for a penitentiary.

In my opinion, the City Fathers are making a mis-
take in wanting to remove the Pen. However, from
what I understand, City Hall has made mistakes be-
fore; that’s why they have rubber mats around the
cuspidors in all the offices. Apparently a few mal-
contents down there are under the impression that
the neighborhood around the Pen is getting too
dangerous for the inmates, and that even the pigeons
are all beginning to move up-town. In fact ‘““They”’
said, ‘“The housing situation at the Penitentiary is
so bad, that they can’t even serve Cottage Pudding.”

Has anyone given any thought to the inmate's
view on this drastic situation? ‘They’ should take
into serious consideration and always remember, no
matter how hot, humid, dank, or musty these old
cells are in the daytime—there is still no place to go
at night. So what if the guards keep the cell doors
locked most of the time, just because it holds up
the walls, and what's the difference if it's so hot
that even the mice take salt tablets) Do “They”
realize that if this site is demolished, many of the
