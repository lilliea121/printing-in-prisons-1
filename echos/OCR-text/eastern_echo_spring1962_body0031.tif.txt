Vie Obeck, of the University of New York, has stated
this concept of it. A person can do five minutes of
workouts a week without moving a muscle in static
contraction, he explained. Push a door, Jump with all
your might, or try to lift a car bumper. The idea is
to work on some immovable object and sustain the
effort for 10 seconds. An all around college athlete
and a former pro-football player, Obeck is mixed up
in a variety of physical fitness programs. “It is not
a new thing,” he said. Bob Hoffman of the York
Barbell Co., is sold on Isometries, although in a way
it hurts his own business. Three members of York’s
U.S. weightlifting team got astonishing results from
the wall-pushing. ““We thought we had a top-secret
weapon to use against the Russians in the Olympics,”
Obeck said, “but we found out they had also been

experimenting with Isometrics for several years.”
He also states any age can do the excercises. Now on
the market are the albums, ‘“Isomertics Exercises.”
There should be a lot of loose doorways and shaky
front bumpers if his record catches on.

Incidentally, a deal had just been set for the
N.Y.U. Athletic Director to turn out a book on the
subject. Many of the fellows who are unable to lift
weights would certainly feel much better with the
Isometric System. This reporter had the pleasure of
listening to the record and found it very stimulating
to execute these exercises in my room. I must admit
the results were really amazing trying to push the
wall down in my room made my arms feel like cords
of steel. Go ahead try pushing any immovable object
you'll feel the results in the after effects.

On April 9th, and April 16th, the two softball
leagues will have gotten underway for the 1962 sea-
son, and thus begin another year of “if’s” and “but’s”
between the Mexican and the Cuban Leagues. The
managers of these different clubs were signing play-
ers at a fiery rate before the outset of the first game.
One player has signed three different contracts to
play ball! (Don’t worry “Chico,” I won’t mention
your name.) Since the managers are still signing and
trading players, here are the tentative listings of the
teams and their managers:

Mexican League
April 9, 1962

Cuban League
April 16, 1962

Falcons
Norman Pearson, Mer.

Cardinals

teorge Sanders, Mer.
Mets Giants

Johnny Dorens, Mer. David Croxton, Mer:

Rangers Braves
Billy Williams, Mer. “Tarzan” Hayman, Mer.
Lynx’s Detroit

DuPree, Mer. Frank Sisak, Mer.

Last year champs, the Giants, are in trouble and it
will come from the Falcons, So Beware! With “Iron-
man” splitting the scene you'll be even more hurt, for

Eastern Echo

he was the best pitcher in either league. Surely Harl
is not one of the fine stock as was “Ironman.” I doubt

whether the Cardinals are able to repeat last year’s
showing of winning over fifty games, and losing one.
The other three teams didn’t like what happened last
season and they’re out to prove it. So look out Card-
inals, Mac has his own club this season; The Mets.
