DISABLED PUBLIC OFFENDERS

(We wish to express our sincere appreciation to Miss Mary E. Switzer, Commissioner, Vocational
Rehabilitation Administration, Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Washington, D. C., and
to Mr. Peter Furek, Rehabilitation Counselor, Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilitation, for

their cooperation in supplying general information included in this article.)

The prisoner who has failed in outside life is often”

the fellow who has been unable for one reason or ano-
ther to do a good job in outside employment. Students
of correctional problems have found evidence to bear
out this lay opinion. They cite a close relationship
between vocational performance and overall community
adjustment among offenders.

It seems logical, therefore, that the governmental
program which deals with the restoration of disabled
. persons to jobs would have a significant role to play
in the correctional field.

The Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilita-
tion has been conducting a program at this institution
since late 1964, to aid disabled men to secure an ac-
tive rehabilitation program—intended to restore them
to economic feasibility. Rehabilitation Counselor
Peter Furek of the Bureau’s office in the Philadelphia
State Office Building, has been responsible for the
program here. The program actually dates before 1964,
but its presently enlarged scale dates to November of
that year. Mr. Furek works closely with State Parole
Board Counselor Wendall Bristol, who is primarily re-
sponsible for coordinating the program at SCIPHA with
the Bureau offices in Philadelphia.

During an interview, Mr. Furek explained that many
services are available to qualified disabled offenders
from this institution. Of primary importance to a dis-
apled person, are such services as physical restoration
(for example, artificial limbs, braces, glasses, psycho-
therapy and physical therapy).

Other important ser-

include: Educational-vocational counseling,

truck driving, barbering, beauty culture, and any other
type of training accredited by the Pennsylvania De-
partment of Public Instruction.

Furek said: “It is the Bureau’s philosophy that
any service necessary to effect a client’s rehabilita-
tion would be considered.”’

The Pennsylvania Bureau of Vocational Rehabilita-
tion is under the Pennsylvania Department of Labor

and Industry, and is directed by Charles L. Eby.

Since 1962, the Vocational Rehabilitation Adminis-
tration of the U. S. Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, has supported ten or more research and
demonstration projects designed to apply vocational
rehabilitation concepts in which the public offender
was the focus of study and/or services. They utilize
a wide range of special techniques, varying from in-
stalling vocational rehabilitation units, to the use of

surgical procedures to aid the rehabilitation of dis-

figured offenders.

In 1962, the first institute was held, bringing to-
gether professionals from both rehabilitation and cor-
rectional fields....to explore ways of working more
closely together. One of the principal outcomes of
this institute and related conferences was an aware-
ness of the critical need for vocational rehabilitation

services on the part of probationers and parolees.

Experimental projects were organized at various
lederal probation offices throughout the country. Each
project included research objectives and full rehabili-
tation services to probationers, parolees, andreleasees,
under the jurisdiction of the respective probation
offices.

Another recent development is approval by the
National Advisory Council for Vocational Rehabilita-
tion of a project under which the National Council on
Crime and Delinquency will establish a Joint Commis-
sion of Correctional Manpower and Training. This
