“In deliberating his guilt or Innocence, you need
not concern yourselves with such trivial matters as to

whether the accused could possibly be innocent. You
need only consider his degree of guilt. The law states
that the Court must instruct on ‘reasonable doubt.’
Now, we ask ourselves, ‘What is reasonable doubt?’
To the layman this means that a reasonable man has
no doubt, and since the members of the jury have
been selected because they are reasonable people, you
should have no difficulty in finding that there is no
doubt. However, if some doubt does remain in your
minds after my charge, you might ask yourselves
why the accused is in court at all if he is innocent?
And why does he eringe when the Court glares at
him? These are matters for you, as members of the
jury, to reflect on. They are merely suggestions by
the Court as to what proper reasoning should lead to
in this case.

“No doubt, you will ask yourselves, ‘What will
happen to the defendant if we find him guilty”? You
need not concern yourselves with this matter, for
sentencing is one of the pleasures of the Court. When
recalling the defendant’s denial of his guilt, it might
also be well to reeall the words of Shakespeare, ‘He
doth protest too much.’

“The Court must caution you not to discuss this
case among yourselves, for this will only tend to fog
the issue and lead to confusion in finding the correct
verdict. The foreman will instruct you in your
proper duties. This about covers my charge. Does
Counsel have anything further?”

“Ves, Your Honor,” said the defense counsel. “Ex-
cuse me for saying so, but that part about the ‘finger
in the pie’ wasn’t quite clear.”

“Very well. Members of the jury, you have heard
the request of the defense counsel asking for clar-
ification of my previous remark concerning the de-
fendant’s having ‘a finger in the pie.’ The Court did
not intend to confuse you or mislead you about the
pie. Actually, the pie is not an issue in the case, and
it was merely a figure of speech used to illustrate a
point I wished to make clear.

“Now, members, before submitting this case for
your final consideration, a final word on the law. The

Constitution guarantees a speedy trial, and this of
course embraces a speedy verdict. It is now 3:05. If
you have not made a decision by 3:07, arrangements
will be made for you to spend the evening—and the
night—in charge of Court officers who will escort you
to the ‘Freeloader’s Hotel.’ There you ean relax and
enjoy yourselves at the expense of the tax-payers.

This will include sleeping accommodations, food re-
freshments, and entertainment. Our budget, how-

ever, does not permit certain items of food such as
hamburgers, hot dogs, and soda pop. There are many
other food items from which you can choose, such as
lobster-tails, filet mignon, and pheasant. In the re-
freshment line, as a substitute for soda pop, you may
have champagne, cocktails, and a choice of imported
wines. As for reading material, you are not per-
mitted to read any books on justice or any material
referring to “The American Way of Life.’ There will
be available to you such magazines as ‘Crime Does
Not Pay,’ ‘The Killer and the Sex-Fiend,’ and that
great book, “Why Do Our Juries Hesitate to Convict.’

“I know this will greatly inconvenience you, being
away from your wives and husbands, and having to
spend the night with strange men and women, but
this is your duty and it should be looked upon as an
opportunity to share in new experiences.”

The following morning a verdict of guilty was ren-
dered and the prisoner was called for sentencing. His
Honor asked, “Have you anything to say before the
Court passes sentence?”

SY CSipe,

His Honor interrupted, “Thank you. I believe you
have expressed yourself quite clearly, but the Court
sees no merit in your plea. This Court has made a
thorough investigation of your background and has
found that your two fathers and three mothers all
voted the split ticket in the last election. In view of
this fact, the Court will give you every possible con-
sideration.

“The sentence of this Court is that you spend the
rest of your natural life in prison. It is hoped that
you will appreciate the mild nature of this sentence.
This Court could have imposed natural and unnat-
ural life sentences to run consecutively. Court ad-
journed.”

IN PASSING

Just a few weeks ago the details of nine ficticious
offenses, along with presentence reports on the ‘of-
fenders’ were set down for the consideration of 50
Ontario magistrates. Even when based on exactly
the same facts, their dispositions ranged far—in one
case, from probation to 14 years imprisonment.

As a result, it often seems that an offender’s punish-

Eastern Echo

ment is determined less by what he did than by what
court tried him. Even when this impression is com-
pletely false—and sometimes it isn’t—there’s always
the danger that disparate sentencing will undermine
the concept of equal justice and bring the law into
contempt. ae
