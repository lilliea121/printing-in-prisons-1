The spider arduously

patiently spins a web

A willow weeps on a sunny day the qualities of goodness and truth,
And its shoulders droop in a helpless way ; deviously spins a web

but... unlike the spider,
The mystery of why the willow tree weeps which devoursAts victim to survive,
Is something that Nature selfishly keeps ; man becomes the victim
And only God, the Great Sculptor of all, of his oww web

The Thoughts of Harry J ohnson

POUR VOW
A big head is a structure
supported by

a narrow-minded foundation ....

May dungeons deep and walls of steel
Never contain, nor e’er conceal,

The priceless words that one may write
On silent wings of friendly light ....

I write for you, O distant friend, A mailed fist of revenge
These hearty words, and pray they'll send could be the inverted weapon
Your lonely heart to pastures green; of self-destruction . .<

Your precious soul to heights serene.

A temple built with heart sincere
Will ever take your footsteps near
That bridge of gold o'er tranquil streams

Of love and joy, and rhythmic dreams. 2A ee

Where prophets drink love's mystic wine. J OA ag aS seiein
of man’s inherent desire
There symphonies of love will play to ascend heavenward
And kindred souls will kneel to pray, and beyond the stars,
That each on wings of song may rise that he may look upon
To love's unconquered paradise. the countenance of his Creator.
