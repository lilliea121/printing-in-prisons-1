“A MAIDEN”

I remember a maiden, not long ago,
Who stole my heart and loved me so;
She gave to me as none could do,

Love so pure, and all so true.

Till angels came to lead her away ;

I loved her more than words could say,
They took her by her pure white hand,
And led her to a far off land.

A preacher spoke the final word—

By all who eared it could be heard;
They placed her beneath the ground—
Above, the flowers bloom all year round.
She was to me a little queen . .

The prettiest maiden I’ve ever seen;

I hope that where she’ll finally rest,

Is paved with gold, and all the best.

I think some day we’ll meet again,

In a world of love and without sin;
All I ean do is hope and pray,

That soon will come that happy day.

“MIRANDA”

Stunning, cunning, wanting and sly,
Hopes and dreams, as high as the sky;
Sacred, charming, bright, and so young,
Voice like an angel, with songs to be sung.

Manners, beauty, poise and grace,
Draped about her like heavenly lace;
Calmness, happiness, placid, and gay,
A smile at the start of each new day.
A giggle, a wiggle, a jiggle, and coy,
Seeing her radiance is such a great joy;
Kind, considerate, dainty and neat,

Thanks to the angel, that made her so sweet.

A sparkle, a gleam, a glow in her eye,

A tear on her cheek and a wimpering ery;
In all of these that are so nice,

Is one little blemish, they’re used to entice.

THE J. WILLIAM WHITE AWARD

ihe earch pacgieom mis scenvuryse Dre J:
William White, was a resident physician in ESP
and later became a member of the Board of In-
spectors. In his will, he provided that a certain
amount of money be placed in trust to be used
by the institution for the prisoner whose term
expired during the year; who had undergone
his first term of penal servitude, whether here
or on any other prison; who was under 25 years
of age or over 65 years of age and who was se-
lected by the authorities as most deserving and
most likely to be of permanently honest ways.
This man was to be given the income of the
fund. Dr. White did this in remembrance of
his service as a resident physician and later as
inspector of this institution.

It appears that this fund did not become op-

erative until after the death of Mrs. White in
192.

This fund has been reactivated and the
Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank is the pres-
ent trustee and under the terms of the recent
adjudication it is our procedure to certify to
the Commissioner who shall receive this award.
This will be an annual award and, for the year
1959, Superintendent William J. Banmiller cer-
tified that Frank R. Amerling be awarded the
$100, because in the Institutional Staff’s opinion
he met the conditions of Dr. White’s will.

ach year, therefore, the staff will recom-
mend the individual whose term has expired
during the year and this, in turn, shall be for-
warded by the Superintendent to the Commis-
sioner, who will certify the name of the nominee
to the trustee for the award.

ART SHOW

Members of the Pen Art Club, formed here nearly
two years ago, are pleased to announce that an ex-
hibit of their works is to be given at the Pyramid
Club, 1517 Girard Ave., Phila., during the month of
May. A minimum of sixty art pieces will be on view,
consisting of oils, water colors, and pastels. This will
be the club’s first showing in the city. They had pre-
viously exhibited at the Langhorn (Pa.) Library,

where much publicity had been received, and where
a few paintine’s had been sold. This is an excellent
indication of the progress being made under the
supervision of Mr. George Redling, prominent illus-
trator and fine artist, who has been conducting the
art classes here. The art class was also featured in a
magazine recently where the paintings drew much
favorable acclaim.
