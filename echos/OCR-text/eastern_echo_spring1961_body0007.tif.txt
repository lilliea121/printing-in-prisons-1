man, James Hadfield, was tried for the crime of firing
a shot at the then reigning monarch, King George III.
Hadfield was a veteran of many wars, and during his
last battle he had been inflicted with a terrible head
wound which caused that member to hang to one
side as though it had been severed. Because of his
wounds and other actions he was discharged from
the service as insane. What were his other actions?
James Hadfield thought he was likened to the Christ,
and the world would only gain salvation if he were
sacrificed. In an attempt to gain this end, he fired
the shot at King George, with the hope that he would
be tried and convicted for attempted assassination,
the penalty for which was death.

At his trial, the crown argued that for him to be
shielded from prosecution on the grounds of insanity
—the defense his attorney, Lord Erskine, was using—
he would have had to have complete deprivation of
memory. Erskine countered that literal translation
of the term, ‘‘complete deprivation’? was completely
impossible and that no such madness existed. He
did admit to rare cases where “‘the human mind is
stormed in its citadel and laid prostrate under the
stroke of frenzy.’’ But in other cases he stated,
‘‘Reason is not driven from her seat, but distraction
sits down upon it along with her, holds her trembling
upon it, and frightens her from her propriety.”’

Going further, Erskine claimed that in some cases
these delusions are so terrific as wholly to overpower
the faculties; in others they are more circumscribed,
yet the disordered imagination still holds the most
uncontrollable dominion over reality and fact, ‘‘and
these are the cases which frequently mock the wis-
dom of the wisest in judicial trials because such per-
sons often reason with a subtlety which puts in the
shade the ordinary conception of mankind; the con-
clusions are just, and frequently profound; but the
premises from which they reason, when within range
of the malady, are uniformly false.’’

In more modern language, Erskine used a theory
that was new for that period of time. He felt that a
man could distinguish between right and wrong,
realize that the act he was about to commit was
wrong, and still exhibit cunning and foresight in the
planning and execution of it; but if that thinking
was the product of a disordered mind, then he should
be legally exempt from prosecution and committed
to an asylum.

Unfortunately, the court agreed with Erskine, and
Hadfield was denied the execution he was looking
OI.

Forty-three years went by, and then in 1843, a
shot fired from the gun of another Englishman, Daniel
MecNaughten, poured fuel on the slumbering coals of
the insanity issue. MeNaughten imagined that-he was
being persecuted and that people were whispering

Eastern Echo

about him behind his back. This obsession became so
magnified in his mind, that he finally walked into the
office of the home secretary—the person he felt was
behind his persecution—and shot to death a man he
mistook for that worthy. In his trial, MeNaughten’s
attorneys put forth the defense that he was not re-
sponsible for his acts and should be committed to an
asylum. However, the prosecution insisted, as in the
Hadfield case, that he knew the difference between
right and wrong at the time he committed his crime,
and was legally open to punishment, despite the fact
that he was definitely a paranoiac.

To settle the question of legal responsibility for
this and future cases, five questions dealing with a
hypothetical case were given to fifteen judges by the
House of Lords. The responses given by fourteen of
the judges—one abstained from answering—consti-
tute the criterion by which all English and twenty-
nine of our American courts now judge criminal re-
sponsibility, and is known as the MeNaughten rule.

In brief, the McNaughten rule holds that a person
is not responsible for the act only if he is so mentally
unsound as to lack the knowledge that the act was
wrong, or could not comprehend it’s (the crime) na-
ture and quality.

However, in a speech delivered before the National
Conference of Bar Councils, Judge Simon E. Sobeloff
showed fiaws in such reasoning by stating:

“This test, known familiarly as the ‘right and
wrong test,’ turns on a specified and very limited
symptom of insanity, which science no longer deems
necessarily or even typically associated with most
serious mental disorders. Only the most drooling
idiot can be said to have no knowledge of right and
wrong, and he almost never gets into the criminal
courts. Judging the issue of insanity according to the
right-wrong test exclusively is like saying as a matter
of law that the only acceptable symptom in defining
appendicitis is a pain in the abdomen and that no
other diagnostic symptom is valid.”’

As the science of psychiatry advanced in learning,
there was growing awareness in a number of states
that a man could be cognizant of the wrongfulness
of his actions and yet be powerless to halt them. This
was known as an ‘‘Irresistible Impulse.’?’ Among
those included in this group were the pyromaniacs
and kleptomaniacs. However, there was still some
disagreement as to the proper way of judging
whether or not a man was held in the grip of an
irresistible impulse when he committed the crime.

Several states adopted what is commonly known as
the ‘‘policeman at the elbow’’ test, which as the
name implies, asks the question ‘‘ Would the defend-
ant have been so badly driven as to have committed
the crime if a policeman had been present?”’
