THE EASTERN ECHO is printed by and for the inmates of the Eastern State Penitentiary
at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, It’s editors, or the institution itself, cannot be held responsible
for plagiarism. The contents of the magazine are not copyrighted unless indicated, and permission
to re-print any material in this issue is cordially granted.

Dear Reader:

Judging from the many
letters that were received,
the Spring issue of ECHO
was a success. Your
comments were flattering
and your constructive
criticisms appreciated.
We now present the Sum-
mer issue of HCHO.

Every publication has
a one-two punch. Our
one-two combination lies
in From the Superinten-
dent's Desk, P-2 and
Cage Two, P-3, wherein
Superintendent Banmiller
and Editor Cuff bring a
message of extreme im-
portance.

On P-4, Employer
Wanted, by Frank Terres,
presents a problem that
has plagued the prisoner
for years. The problem
is presented and a solu-
wom is pahyem . . , IP,
profiles one of our fellow
inmates ... Turning to
P-10, we make a tour of
our prison hospital, a
word picture of how
a prison hospital is
operated.

Knowing that all men
share an interest in the
rights of humans, our
Editor gives us, Analysis

..:- Human Righis, on
P-14. On P-16, Andre
I, PASEMeE Caw? Ss Wie
Quality of Mercy, is an
answer to the critics who
condemn acts of mercy
towards prisoners. This
should open the eyes of
society, and give the true
picture. . . Joey, on P=
21, is the story of a little
boy who, at last, is in
the throes of growing up.

This issue would not
be complete without a
heart-warming story de-
voted to Mother, and our
Poetry Editor, Jesse
Burch, creates a master-
piece in Bouquet of
Words on P-31.

There you - have it,
Dear Reader. We invite
your letters letting us
know how YOU hike our
efforts.

Tackling his big “prob-
lem”, our subject needs
