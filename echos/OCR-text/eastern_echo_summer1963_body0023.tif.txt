It can be assumed, with a certain
amount of accuracy, that all musicians
aspire to perform on their instruments
with other musicians, be he student,
amateur or other. With this thought
in mind, I would like to discuss a few
aspects that are necessary in developing
some degree of professionalism. The
same problems and their corrective
methods exist in both the dance band
and concert band and do not differ in
theory. However, in the dance band
because of its smaller instrumentation
and exposed situation of the parts, the
problems are emphasized.

One of the factors that immediately
distinguish the amateur from the pro-
fessional organization is precision. In
top bands there is an absolute precision
of attack, release and phrasing. This
is not achieved by a tapping of the feet
or by just watching the leader. That
is just the beginning. Precision can be
completely acquired only when the mu-
sicians feel together, work with each
other, think with each other —in short,
the members of the band must obtain
such a close awareness of one another
in the group that the split second of the
attack or release is intuitive.

While the members must work for
this precision, it must never become
mechanical or stiff. This aspect of
precision cannot be taught. It can
come only from experience and playing
together.

The student must learn to follow the
leader. In all dance band music there
is slight variations in phrasing and spe-
cial effects such as shakes and fall-offs.
The player must follow the lead of his
section head who will establish the ex-
act moment and manner of execution.
The leader in this situation will vary
with the different sections of the music.
In the case of a sax soli the leader will
be the first alto sax, and when involved
in a complete ensemble chorus the
leader will then be the first trumpet
player. These two positions are the
key spots in any band. All players
must follow their lead in attacking,
releasing, and phrasing.
