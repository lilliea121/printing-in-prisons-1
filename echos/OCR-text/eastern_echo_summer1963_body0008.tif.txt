be passed off with the remark, as the man says, “You
will always find some Eskimo ready to instruct the
Congolese on how to cope with heat waves.” If noth-
ing is done, the harm will be irreparable and another
generation will pay for this with compound interest.
We must make progress, but then, some people con-
sider it progress if a cannibal uses a knife and fork.

From an item appearing in a Philadelphia eve-
ning newspaper, it is apparent that some action is
being taken by at least 30,000 of the people who are
immediately concerned with strip mining:

“‘Mines’ Secretary H. Beecher Charmbury will tour
the state’s anthracite strip mining area on April | 0th
to determine if there is need for tighter state con-
trols.

“Charmbury’s tour will follow by less than two
months Governor Scranton’s air inspection of the
bituminous strip. mining region. Scranton now has
a bill before the legislature that would place stricter
regulations on soft coal strip mining operators, espe-

cially in the area of backfill requirements.

“Charmbury fixed the date of his tour yesterday
at a meeting with a nine-member delegation which
took issue with recent statements by the secretary
that there was little pressure for tighter strip mine
controls in the hard coal region.

“The secretary said he hopes Forests and Waters
Secretary Maurice K. Goddard and Commerce Sec-
retary John K. Tabor would accompany him on the
tour.

“The delegation from the Wyoming Valley com-
plained that tighter anthracite controls were being
ignored by the Scranton Administration in favor of
action in the soft coal fields.

“The governor and | are just as much interested
in the anthracite as the bituminous regions,’ Charm-
bury said. ‘But he has concentrated his time in
developing strong bituminous strip mine regulations
because the issue in the soft coal fields is much more

in the public attention.’

“The statement was immediately disputed by
Harry G. Davis, who said: “The public is aroused—
we represent thousands of residents from Scranton
to Sunbury.’

“‘Charmbury reassured the group that Governor
Scranton intended to develop an anthracite strip

mine bill as soon as the bituminous situation was sta-

bilized.

“Evens told Charmbury that residents of the an-
thracite region have written ‘a citizen’s bill’ which
require backfilling to complete contour, fix reason-
able times for completing backfilling and specify
what is meant by abandonment.

“The group showed Charmbury 30,000 sig-
natures calling for complete backfilling in the hard
coal strip mines.”

Olsewatious ou Penclegy
hy Jim Short, Editor of the “GAZETTE”, New Castle, Delaware

Southern states have been accused of being mighty back-
wards in their conceptions of penology, but recently a plan
has come to light through various news media, which show
that at least one southern state, North Carolina, has come
up with a progressive rehabilitative feature.

North Carolina’s approach to rehabilitation is called a
work-release program, and it is based on the idea that a
prisoner with a steady outside job is of greater benefit both
to himself and to the state.

Sydney J. Harris was impressed enough by this program
to make it the subject of his syndicated column a few weeks
ago. Harris called it a “‘heartening story” and said, ““This
is the way a prison system should be administered—to offer
the men hope and a job opportunity, not merely punish-
ment. It is an accepted truism among penologists that most
jails deform men more than they reform them.”

North Carolina’s work-release system began in 1957 un-
der State Prison Director George W. Randall, and has
evolved into the most liberal outside work plan in the
nation.

All inmates with sentences of five years or less are el-
igible for consideration, provided they are not sex offenders,
confirmed alcoholics or drug addicts. Each prisoner’s
weekly paycheck is turned over to the state, which gives him
$5 for personal expenses, keeps $1 for state furnished trans-
portation—and $2.25 a day for room and board. ‘The
remainder is divided up between the prisoner's family and
a trust fund that he receives on completing his sentence.

The program has been a success and prisoners are work-
ing at such jobs as barbers, machanics, cooks, secretaries
and farmers. One employer, a motel owner, said, “I’m going
to use more prisoners in the future. They're harder workers
and better than those that come in off the street.”

So far as known, no prisoner has ever committed a crime
while at work. Only a handful have gotten into trouble
after their release. Eventually North Carolina hopes to
have 1,000 prisoners working on the outside—more than
the entire jail population of Delaware.

Undoubtedly, the majority of inmates incarcerated in
Delaware would be eligible for such a program, if we had
one. Men jailed for non-support or other non-violent
crimes could actually pay their way through prison and
continue to contribute to the support of their families. It
would alleviate the feeling of helplessness that a man feels
while he is being punished. And last, but not least, as a
dollars and cents proposition, it would be a good thing for
the taxpayer.
