In a surprising discussion held last June, ESP
inmates were encouraged to air their opinions and
dissatisfactions with key members of The Penn-
sylvania Prison Society. President Negley K.
Teeters and Executive Secretary G. Richard Bacon
sought and received the Warden’s consent to meet
with the inmates in an effort to obtain both in-
creased understanding of the agency’s program, and
prisoner suggestions for the improvement of their
function and methods of administering direct aid to
prisoners.

The conclave was held in a capacity-filled con-
ference room. No member of the institution’s staff
or personnel was present, and the inmates were
permitted to voice their most candid views and
comments.

Typical of the largely non-ECHO inmates in
attendance, an elderly lifer, seated beside another
lifer whose sentence had been commuted by the
Board of Pardons, expressed the opinion that so
little help had been rendered to needy inmates, he
had grave doubt as to whether the Society was
actually known to exist. ‘‘So far as I know,’’ the
lifer volunteered, ‘‘no prisoner ever received any
direct aid, such as a parole plan, during my 18 years
of imprisonment.”’

The subject of parole plans seemed to dominate
the discussion, which had all the ramifications of a
verbal tag-team wrestling match, with no holds
barred. However, Joe Corvi, inmate clerk to the
institution’s Vocational Director, apparently was
more conversant with this phase of the Society’s
activity, as he related instances where contacts had
been made on various occasions with respect to
parole plans. However, he indicated these contacts
were in his opinion inadequate and ineffective, con-
cluding that too many inmates were being held in
‘prison due to the lack of a parole plan. ‘‘I realize
your finances and resources may be limited,’’ he
added, “‘but with all those important persons con-
nected with the Society, conceivably they could
combine their efforts and perhaps considerably al-
leviate the condition, if they really wanted to.’’

Another inmate expressed absolutely no faith
at all in the organization, stating that their cor-
respondence amounted to ‘‘just so much talk, but

no action.’’

Dr. Teeters, in a manner reminiscent of the late
Lionel Barrymore, pointed out specific cases where
such help was rendered, but admitted that under the
present setup the Society could do so in only a few
instances. After a prisoner has exhausted all other
resources, though it likes to maintain contact with
him throughout such attempts, he explained, the

Society would be willing to take over and extend

aid in the procuring of a parole plan. ‘‘The Society
is largely misunderstood,’’ he observed. ‘‘We won’t
run errands for inmates or do things they can do
themselves. ’’

Mr. Bacon graphically demonstrated the diffii-
culty in procuring parole plans. ‘‘Of 850 agency
interviewed prospective employers, only eight offers
of employment resulted,’’ the tall ruddy faced
Secretary lamented. ‘‘However, if we could set up
a system ... similar to the one in New York State...
whereby we could have closer contact with the in-
mate, we could do much better.’’ Hlaborating
somewhat on the New York system, Mr. Bacon re-
ferred to it as the Osborne Association—whose ap-
parent success in this field is widely known, a feature
article having appeared in the July, 1946 issue of the
Reader’s Digest.

Veteran inmates remembered Mr. Bacon, now
sporting strands of gray in his hair, as a diligent
case worker in earlier years when he was employed
at the Graterford institution for a period of five
years.

Addressing the group, the soft spoken Mr.
Bacon said, ‘‘It’s hard to get society to back
prisoners, and when they do volunteer in rare
instances, it must be an unusual case. Lots of op-
position with which we are faced stems from the
erroneous impression that The Society is a senti-
mentalist organization. If citizens would take more
interest, they would soon find out that we em-
phatically are not, and that we have the best
interests of society at heart in all our endeavors.

‘Our type of service isn’t set up to meet every
prison need,’’ Mr. Bacon continued. ‘‘If we con-
tact a prospective employer or sponsor, we are
reasonably sure the prisoner we are representing
is a good parole risk.’’ The Society’s method of
