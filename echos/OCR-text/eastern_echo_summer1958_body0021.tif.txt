something about it. . Come-on Pop, get crackin, we
got a two second alert to move out. Get to the
trailer, or are you too old to make it that far?’”’

‘“These old bones will carry me for another day.
I got all the ammo I’ll need in this war and the next,
got a string of grenades early this evening. I had
a hunch this reserve business was for the birds.
T’ll just smoke a pipe-load while the boys load up.
What the sam hill’s happened anyhow ?”’’

"Krauts broke through in force, intelligence
estimates about a divison, overran the forward sec-
tor about half an hour ago... God knows what hap-
pened to them up there, probably a real butcher’s
pienic. Oh! these lousy mountains How in the
name of all that’s holy can anyone set up a decent
line along them? As soon as the word comes we
move out of here on the double. Division’s gonna
syneronize our jump-off with Able Company over
there on the next hill, so we can set up a line at the
base of the mountain. Artillery is moving in here, a
tank company back at Vaugney is on it’s way to
support us, in case we meet up with Adolph’s goons
and, we sure as gawd made little apples are gonna
meet them, how can we miss? Intelligence don’t
know anymore than what I told you. They’ll prob-
ably be waiting for us down on the flat lands by the
time we get there. All of you got everything you
need?’’

‘‘Sarjint, I been faithful to you, to the company,
to the Division, to the Army and to the ever-loving
Yew-nited States of America, nigh on to four year,
and if it ain’t ovah steppin’ ma rank as a soljer,
and a flag waving citizen, I’d take it mighty kindly
iffen you’d grant me a boon.”’

“© fer the love of ... Okay Snuffy, what’s on
that poor excuse you call a mind? Come on, come
on, we ain’t got forever.”’

‘‘Sarjint, I beg yore leave to report back to the
field horspital, I been feeling right porely all day...”

‘‘Are you nuts?’’

‘‘Hiver since we had to hog tie you back in the
States to put shoes on you, your dogs been on the

‘¢,. Also ma chest’s been aheavin and agrow-

“Okay, Snuffy I understand how bad off you
are. My heart is bleeding for you, spare me any
more details. I don’t give a hoot in hell if your head
rolls off right now. Pick up that piece, cause when

with us, pumping fifties into them and giving them
plenty miseries. <A spraint inkle! What in jumping
Zeus, is a spraint inkle?’’ |

‘‘Sarjint, yore pure mean. Know’d from the
day circumstan’s brought us together yore heart
was the heart of a flint-hearted man. Seed some
mean men in mah day but a mean !rishman outdo’s
them all, and a Iyrish sarjint outdo’s anythin man
nor beast air thunk up!”’

‘Snuffy, if the army ever gets a piece that can
spout lead the way you spout that dialect you call
talk, we’d win this war in jig time.’’

“Why thanky kindly sarjint. Know’d you
weren’t all mean. Just been joshin a little to keep
your spirits up. Can I report to the medics now?’’

“Not now and not ever! You’re comin right
along with us down this mountain. How do you
say no and mean no, in that backwoods palaver?”’

‘‘Kindness done went outen the window. Aftah
ah wins this heah little ole spat comin up, I’m letter
writtin mah senytore back home and telling him of
the meanness of you Iyrish sarjints. Ah said all I
intend to say on the matter !’’

‘“Might as well get off your feet men, division’s
acting up to par. Things are probably as snafu’ed
up as usual. Take it easy, we’ll need all the rest
we can get before this deal’s straightened out.’’

“Sarge?”’

“This side of the mountain we got to go down,
I ain’t seen much of it, but it looked to me to be
pretty steep. How’s the road?’’

“The road? Well, Baby, I’m glad you asked
me. Listen, you guy’s, try to remember what I tell
you, you might need the info later. I ain’t been
down it yet, but the map gives a pretty good picture
of it. Were right on the summit here, see? Now
this road has seven levels between base and top, got
that? No? Well, starting ‘at the base the road
eraduates up at an angle for a mile or so, then still
angling and climbing it reverses back in the opposite
direction. Hach level is terraced and it continues
this way, level after level till it reaches the top.
Got it now?’’

‘Yeah, I think so, how’s the terrain along the
sides of the road?”’

‘“Heavily wooded, lots of under brush. But
keep to the middle of the road, got that you guys?
Keep to the middle. If you trip over the outer edge,
chances are you might just tumble down the slope to
the terrace below. But, be on the ball, recon says,
there are some bad spots where its a sheer drop
straight down. Okay, Lieutenant Reeves is signal-
ing, lets go. One more thing, don’t bunch up, but
for Gawds sakes, keep your eyes open. We won’t
