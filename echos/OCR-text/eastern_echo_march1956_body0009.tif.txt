ty

eyes, and a figure that curves in some very wonder-
ful places. She comes onstage with a crash of
cymbals, and a gown that fits as close as the next
second. During the first part of her act, she sings
one of those naughty little songs, and quivers her
torso at strategic moments. Then when she has the
undivided attention of all the grease paint lovers,
she undulates slowly across the stage, exposes one
lovely, creamy shoulder, and coyly releases the
zipper on the side of her gown. This is my cue to
come in, mute and real sweet, with ‘Tea for Two.’
But when she arrives at the intersection this time,
I forget to blow my horn.”’

“Instead of being at the Gayety I am at that
moment in the Palladium, heading my own outfit
and really sending all the cats. This is the same
old dream as always, only now I had just added a
couple of new twists. The only thing that kept
me from organizing my own combo before was a
conspicuous absence of coin of the realm. But in
twist number one, I had solved the problem—I held
up a bank. Twist number two, Jeanie is begging
me to marry her, and I tell her that I will consider
her proposal.’’

‘“By the time I come out of this castle in the
clouds, the whole band is giving me the old fish eye.
I almost fracture my jaw getting my horn to my lips,
but as soon as I blow one feeble note, I realize that
Miss Dare has already made her exit. I manage
to stagger through the finale, and then I creep
backstage and wait for the eruption.’’

‘‘A loud silence greets me as I step into the
wings. The ice water is still pouring out of Jeanie’s
eyes, and Doreen Dare is looking at me as if I had
just crawled out from under some rock. It is too
painful for me to repeat what was said, but the up-
shot of the whole thing is that Doreen tells the big
cheese that it is either her, or me. So naturally,
seeing as how my proportions are nowhere near as
enticing as Miss Dare’s, things end up with me
entering the ranks of the unemployed. I stalk out
ot the Gayety with my two weeks notice, and I now
proceed on a determined crusade to drink the town
Cusya

‘It is several thousand drinks, and I don’t
know how many days later, when I wake up in
my own pad, with a taste in my mouth like a bird
and animal store. My head feels so big that I
can’t imagine how I ever got it through my bed-
room door. Man, I had the grandaddy of all hang-
overs! The room finally stops jumping long enough
for me to get up and take inventory, and I find that
I am the proud owner of one beautiful shiner, a real
eone array of whiskers, and thirty one cents in cash.
Just at this ecstatic moment my landlady, Mrs.
Murphy, who is a veritable angel of mercy, knocks
on the door and tells me that if the rent is not
caught up by tomorrow, I am to be locked out.
As you writers would put it, I am locked on the
horns of a dilemna. To put it mildly, I am one sad
eat. I am just in the process of deciding whether
to take gas or cut my wrists when the idea hits me.”’

‘Tt is the same old dream again. Me, in front
of my outfit—and all I have to do is heist a small

EASTERN EcHo

bank. That’ll solve everything. My rent will get
paid and Mrs. Murphy will be happy again. Vl
be able to organize a good five piece combo, and
even Jeanie might come back into the picture. Why
didn’t I think of this before? Of course I realize
that this is against the law, but I’m going to con-
sider it as a loan until I get back on my feet.
After all, I tell myself, there’s nothing wrong with
just borrowing some money.”’

‘‘Now that my mind is made up, I proceed to
set the stage for my venture into the underworld.
First, I sit down and carefully print out a note
that goes like this—‘‘Put $5,000 in twentys in this
bag and you will not get hurt. Don’t try to make
any outcry until I have been out of here for five
minutes. I will be watching you.” I sit back and
survey my work, and then I pridefully admit that
it is even worthy of the late John Dillinger. Then,
I put on an old coat and hat and a pair of sun
glasses, grabbed a paper bag from the closet, and
proceed to the nearest drug store.”’

‘At the drug store, I spend twenty-nine of my
last thirty one cents on a toy pistol. I remember
thinking something like this—‘Ha! even J. Pierr-
pont Morgan never snowballed a small investment
lke this into the proportions that I am about to
realize.’ I leave the store feeling like the sage of
Wall Street, and I trickle down the street towards
the neighborhood bank which is about two blocks
away. When I reach the bank, I pull down my hat,
put up my coat collar, and walk in.’’

‘‘T side up to the nearest teller’s window, flash
the gun, and with my best Humphry Bogart snarl,
I shove the note and the bag at him. His adams
apple does a double take as he reads the note, and
then he starts putting the loot into the bag. When
he finishes, he hands it back to me, without a word,
and I sashay out of the place with my future in a
paper bag.’’ -

‘‘And that’s it up to now, Johnny. You know
the rest. Here I am fronting my own combo, and
just today I get a letter from Jeanie telling me all
is forgiven, and she’ll marry me as soon as I ask
her to. But man, I’m really moaning low, and you
know why. Well Cuz, Pll dig you later, 1’m going
to go rest up for a while. So long.’’

I guess by now you’re wondering why Scat’s
not happy. After all, you say, he’s got his band
and his girl—what else could anybody want? Well,
here’s the pitch. As you know, I’m a reporter.
I dish out those lurid phrases that are so avidly
gobbled up by the readers of the ‘‘Sentinel.’’ The
‘““Sentinel’’, in case you aren’t familiar with it, is
a newspaper that is written by and for the convicts
of the Centre State Penitentiary.

It seems that all the time that Scat was playing
Jesse James in the bank, the teller had his foot on
one of those silent alarm systems. Seat walked
right out into the waiting arms of the local
gendarmes. Oh well, as the French say, ‘‘C’est
la vie.’’
