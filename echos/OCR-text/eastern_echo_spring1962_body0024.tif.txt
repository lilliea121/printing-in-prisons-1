Knowing that I would have to put down a few
thoughts for the Echo again this issue, I’ve been
keeping notes on the passing scene—and_ present.
In some eases, the scene didn’t pass quickly enough;
in others, it passed too quickly. In still others, ’'m
afraid, I didn’t care one way or the other. Now you
take . . . Well, make the whole piece, man, because
I invested several lousy days into it.

Musicians: Originators of the term “Cats” and
they knew what they were talking about.

Maynard Ferguson: | dig the technique and ad-
mire his range but I sometimes get the impression
I’m listening to a dog whistle.

Chris Connor: An imitation of June Christy imitat-
ing Anita O’Day.

Mose Allison: I am a member in good standing of
the, “We Dig Mose From Tippo, Miss. Society.”

Lawrence Welk: Some guys will do anything for
a laugh.

Newport Youth Band: | still think they're a bunch
of midgets putting us on.

Records: Next, after the subway trains, jet planes,
sonic booms, depth charges, and the actual sounds of
a six-car traffie accident at 13th and Locust, will be
a championship ping-pong match between Monk and
Cannonball, im stereo, of course.

Institution Disc Jockeys: I had to give that bum
Murphy two Peanut Huckos for one Benny Carter!
Last time I trade with that eat.

Soul Music: Nobody knows what it is; every ree-
ord company started it; everybody’s playing it, and
we were getting tired of funky music anyway... .

they just get put away.

Shotgun Slade: A western gunfight and a blues
playing vibes player, to me, just don’t make it.

Al Raskiewicz: If he could only have kicked that
Spike Jones influence.

Conga Drum Players: What do they do with their
hands when they’re sitting around digging music?

What is a Jazz singer? Hang yourself up on that
one for awhile.

Ben Webster: Poor cat. He’s been playing soul
music for 20 years and never knew it.

Paul Desmond: Do you ever get the feeling he’s
influenced by Earl Bostic?

R &R Disc Jockeys: How can they sleep at night?

Jackie Leeds: The Grandma Moses of musie.

Third Stream Music: Everytime I hear this album
played on the radio, I think I’ve got two stations
coming in at once.
