enjoys in a hospital. He lives a dull, routine, tread-
mill existence. In many cases, the food is neither
particularly good nor particularly tasty. Starches
takes the place of proteins and there is a drab, mo-
notonous sameness about the meals. In place of a
cheerful outside room, a man lives in a cage—a
rather narrow, cramped cage, as far as human needs
are concerned.

Punishment is the best crime deterrent we have
been able to find, so far, and it’s going to be a long
time before any acceptable substitute is found.
However, when we start thinking about curing crime
in terms of punishment we get into problems that
aren’t solved too easily.

So I was very much interested in seeing what
happened in Judge Carter’s court.

We watched fifteen cases, fifteen separate de-
fendants brought up for sentencing.

When Judge Carter pronounced sentence in
each of these cases, it was done with all the dignity
of a justice of a court. Yet somehow, in every
sentence that he passed, the judge managed to ex-
plain the reason why socicty must resort to punish-
merits

Sitting up there in his robes of office, he repre-
sented the majesty of the law, but he also repre-
sented real justice, justice tempered with a very
human consideration. It was apparent that he had
given considerable thought to each case that came
before him, and there was none of the holier-than-
thou attitude nor the bitter, vindictive attitude
which so many prisoners resent.

However, the thing I want to tell you readers
about is what happened after the sentencing.

Judge Carter had the defendants all brought
into his chambers after court had adjourned. There,
the judge divested himself not only of his robes of
office, but of his coat, as well. He sat there in his
shirtsleeves and he talked to these men as individuals
and he talked man to man.

He said to one individual, “I hesitated a long
while before giving you probation. I don’t know
whether you can make good or not, but ’m going to
give you a chance. Now here, apparently, is your
trouble. Here’s what you’ve got to guard against.
Your record shows that you can get along all right
for a while, then you get out with some friends and
have a few drinks, then the first thing you know,
you've gone haywire. You want to get in a ear and
go for a joy ride. There’s nothing particularly
vicious about what you do, but this is the second
time you’ve broken the law.

“You got along all right while you were mar-
ried; then you and your wife were divorced and you
started having trouble. T want you to know that
Pve taken an interest in your gase, and your pro-
bation officer is going to take an interest in it.

“Now, don’t make any mistake about these pro-
bation officers. They’re not cops, they’re not judges,
they're not jailers. They are people society has
trained for the purpose of giving you help. Re-
member that, and see if you can’t co-operate with
them and get back in the groove.”

Then the judge turned to another individual
whom he had ordered sent to prison. He looked
him straight in the eye and said, “Now I couldn’t
give you probation. I had to send you to prison.
The reason I’m sending you to prison is because I
think it may do you some good. It can do you a lot
of good if you want it to.

“Yowre going to a federal prison. That’s not
like a county jail and it isn’t like a state’s prison.
Yowre going to find some opportunities there for
advancement, if you want to take advantage of those
opportunities.

“Tf I had given you probation, it wouldn’t have
done you a bit of good. You can’t make it by your-
self. Yowre going to need help. You're going to
have to have some body help you with your discip-
line until you’ve learned how to discipline yourself.”

And so, on down the line, the judge talked to
each person frankly, as an individual, as a fellow
human being. And then he said to them, “Now,
look, I want you people to keep in touch with me.
All of you. You fellows who have been sentenced
to prison, [ want to know how you're getting along.
Write to me, keep in touch with me. I have volumes
of correspondence with people who have been in my
court. A lot of them are making good; some of
them I’ve been able to help.

“And you people who are on probation, if you
run into any problems that you can’t solve with your
probation officer, if you get into any situation where
you feel it will do you any good to talk with me, I
want you to come in here and talk with me. I'll
find the time, either after court or before court, and
we'll sit down and talk it over.

“That’s all, boys, and good luck to you.”

I watched those men as they filed out of the
judge’s chambers. I heard one of them say, ““That’s
the first time the law ever gave me a break.” One
of the men had tears in his eyes.

Those men had come to a fork in the road, and a
wise, a humane judge had helped them get their
feet on the right fork.

More judges with this outlook , this genuine
interest in the people who pass through their courts,
would do an enormous job in cutting down crime.
People who go to prison woudn’t start serving their
sentences with the bitter hatred of society which is
almost inevitable when the sentencing judge has the
attitude of vindictive self-righteousness, when his
