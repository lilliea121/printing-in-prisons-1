Eastern Echo

“What have you done to improve yourself since you have been here ?”’

This is a question usually asked by some member of the staff when inter-
viewing men for parole or commutation applications. “Have you attended
church service, enrolled in school, established a good work and block record,
sought counselling or have you just pulled time anxiously awaiting your release

date?) *

Participating in the treatment facilities offered by the staff is no assurance
that you will be granted parole or commutation. Many other factors are taken
into consideration by the parole or commutation board. However, by taking
advantage of the opportunity to change your way of thinking should certainly

weigh heavily in your favor.

Many men have left the institution with much more than they had on arrival.
This is something that you as an individual must decide for yourself. Shall |
waste away more of my life or do something to improve it? We will show you

the way to go.... . YOU must make the journey!
