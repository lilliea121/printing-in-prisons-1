To any of you who may be interested, the CHO office

one is far from easy. So come on down and pick up a few.
If you do complete one we’d like to publish it for you.

FREEDOM (cont’d.)

Look at it this way. Bars of hostility, bitterness,
resentment, unbridled lust and greed imprison men as
do bars of steel and high, stone walls.
‘‘....Every one who commits sin is a slave to sin”’

(John 8:34). The most important question of life, then

Jesus said,

is the religious question: How to be freed from these
forces that hold us in spiritual—emotional bondage?

Jesus said: ‘‘If you continue in my word, you are
truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and
the truth will make you free.’’ This truth which makes
us free is found most fully in Jesus who identified
Himself as The Truth, The Way, The Life. In Him we
truly come to know our own deeper selves—our weak-
nesses and our needs. As Dr. H. Park Tucker, Chap-
lain at Atlanta Penitentiary, puts it: “‘Men who have
found God through his Living Word are free. When
prisoners have found God, His guiding presence pierces
the gray specter of meaninglessness and gives to them
a new sense of dignity, purpose, and hope. When a
man has found God and commited his life to His will
and purposes, he shall walk in freedom—even if he
walks within prison walls.”’
