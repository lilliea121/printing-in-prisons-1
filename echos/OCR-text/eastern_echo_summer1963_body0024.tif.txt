do not know what to listen for. This creates faulty

intonation.

He must become aware of playing in
tune and to listen to the harmony of the chord. He
does not play ina vacuum. All elements, from the
harmonic rhythm of the piano and bass to the melo-
dy and contrapuntal fills of the band, must mesh into

an harmonious whole.

He must know his instrument and the notes of his
instrument that will tend to be out of tune. Knowl-
edge of the alternate fingerings will help to bring
those notes into tune. The student will have to learn
the various characteristics of his instrument—for
example, the saxes have a tendency to go flat on a
crescendo and to go sharp on a diminuendo because
of dropping the jaw or pinching the embouchure; the
reverse is true with the brass having a tendency to go
sharp on a crescendo and flat on a diminuendo due
to adding or detracting air pressure without applying
lip compensation.

Other than the generalized facts mentioned above,
there are more specific areas of intonation problems
that must be pointed out.

1. Open octaves in the brass, particularly if the
upper voice is above the staff.

2. Unison high notes in both the brasses and
reeds.

3. Mixed combinations of instruments in soli or
duet passages; trumpet and sax or clarinet

and sax, especially in the upper register.

4. Loud sections and heavy accents will tend to
be forced.

loud sections.

Many students will overblow on
They should realize the dif-
ference between overblowing and projection
of the tone.

5. Pedal notes on the trombone will usually be
sharp.

6. Extremely soft sections in the brasses will
have a tendency to be flat since they are usu-
ally played by pinching and without enough
breath support.

A balanced sound is achieved when each part is

clearly heard. There must be a proper amount of

pleeaciae
nate. This will usually be the first trumpet, first
alto, or in the solo part.

The melody or top part must predomi-
Occasionally, in the sax

section, the lead may swiich to the first tenor. All
others are subordinated to this part but is not meant

to imply that the other parts are not important as the
lead. Every part is important. When playing with-
in a section or on a complete ensemble part the
supporting players should play “up to’ the lead,
which means to play their parts as loud as the lead.
All parts should be heard equally but never over-
power the top part.

When playing a modulation, the player who has
the modulating note or notes should take care to
play them with a little emphasis but not to the extent
of overpowering the others. These notes will easily
be recognized as they will be the notes that are acci-
dentally sharpened, flattened or naturalized in the

passage.

When using vibrato within a section all section
men should match the pattern used by the lead man.
Differences in vibrato will have an effect on the bal-
ance of the chord. Tone quality, also, has to be

matched within the sections as close as possible.

If a chord is spread throughout the band with the
trumpets on top, saxes in the middle and the trom-
bones at the bottom, the lower men should play just
a little louder in order to acquire the needed balance.

An overwhelming number of amateur and student
musicians play with an almost complete disregard of
dynamics. In most instances they play at a con-
sistent mezzoforte level which produces no interest
and very little contrast. Students must realize that

it is not necessary to blast all the time in order to be

heard.

Close attention should be paid to all dynamic
markings bringing out all accents and szforsandos.
When playing the forte-piano, attack on “‘|’’ and ex-
aggerate the softening. Watch for all crescendos
and diminuendos. These should be exaggerated

also.

It cannot be stressed enough, the importance of
listening to what is going on in the band and ac-
