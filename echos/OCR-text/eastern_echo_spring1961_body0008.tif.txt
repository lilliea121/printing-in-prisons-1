But even that test can be ignored as is illustrated
in the case of the United States vs. Kunack:

Soon after entering the service, Kunack became de-
pressed and started threatening to kill someone. This
thought of committing violence led him to consult the
divisional psychiatrist, but he received no aid from
him. He then consulted two chaplains and again was
put off. In an attempt to get a discharge, even a dis-
honorable one, he stole the boots of his company com-
mander, but in vain. He then talked of ‘*punching

?

the commanding general in the nose’’ in hopes of
eetting a dishonorable discharge. Finally he stated
that he would shoot an officer and the blame would
rest upon the shoulders of the major who had refused
to get him discharged. The men he told this to only
mocked him with taunts, nicknamine him ‘‘Killer,’’
and suggested that if he had to kill someone it should
be himself. Two or three days before the crime he
announced that a lieutenant was to be the victim, and
again he was ignored. On the day
of the crime, Kunack loaded his
carbine, marched up to a table
where several officers and civilians
were eating, and from a few inches
away shot the victim through the
chest. He then assumed the po-
sition of parade rest.

During his trial it was shown
that he had quit high school a few
months before his class graduated
because he was bothered and wor-
ried. It was testified too, that he
had onee jumped off a bridge
seventy-five feet high, while an-
other time he was seen standing on
his head while driving a speeding
motorcycle. In his testimony, Kun-
ack stated that on the day of the
killing he had no been thinking
too much about murdering someone and his loading
of the carbine was ‘‘mechaniecal.’’ He did remember
thinking that ‘“‘probably by this time next month I
will be dead.’’ He knew what he was about to do
was wrong, yet he was powerless to stop himself, and
his only hope was that someone would stop him be-
fore he killed. When the act was finally over, his
only feeling was one of being drained out.

Regardless of the testimony, the psychiatrists that
testified for the government felt that Kunack was
free from mental disease and easily capable of dis-
tinguishing right from wrong, and adhering to the
right, although two of them did admit that he was
‘“emotionally unstable.’’ The defense introduced no
expert testimony and when the case was referred to
the Surgeon General’s office, during a review, that

“Like, Bongo’s are out, Harps are in!’’

office felt that on the information furnished, the de-
fendant was sane.

In the meantime, however, Kunack had been sen-
teneed to the Fort Leavenworth Disciplinary Bar-
racks where he suffered two violent outbreaks. Upon
the recommendation of a psychiatrist, stationed at
the barracks, he was transferred to Fitzsimmons Gen-
eral Hospital where he was examined by a board of
medical officers. Their findings concurred with the
original examiners, and once again he was found sane
at the time of crime, trial and sentence, although he
was again found ‘‘emotionally disturbed.’’

Another psychiatrist, Dr. Manfred Guttmacher, was
asked to examine the defendant and give an opinion.
He reported that he had found Kunack to be a para-
noid schizophrenic who was suffering from a _ psy-
chotie irresistible impulse at the time he committed
the crime and should not be held responsible.

A criminal psychologist also agreed with the diag-
nosis of paranoid schizophrenia and once again the
case was taken to the board of re-
view for evaluation. The Board,
after reviewing all the conflicting
testimony stuck to it’s original
verdict, holding that the accused
was sane at the time of crime, ete.

In an attempt to vindicate itself,
the army qouted the ‘‘policeman
at the elbow’”’ rule, But, it had no
value as it was established that
Kunack committed this act in full
view of several officers, anyone
who could have stopped him with
a quick command.

Since both the MeNaughten
Rule and The Irresistible Impulse
test have come under fire there ap-
peared to be little chance for a so-
lution until 1869 when the Su-
preme Court of New Hampshire
handed down a decision that swept aside the Me-
Naughten rule. Banishing insistence upon the right-
wrong test the court simply stated that an accused is
not criminally responsible if the act was the product
of mental disease or mental defect. The court did not
define any set pattern for determining insanity but
left the determination up to the testimony of the psy-
chiatric expert. However, while this, the Pike de-
cision was a definite solution to the problem of deter-
mining culpability, it was not adopted by any other
