Echoes From The Echo

In the Summer issue of the ECHO, I under-
took to write an article re: the new Chairman of
the Pennsylvania Board of Parole, who succeeded
Major Hill. In this article, I endeavored to depict
the humanitarian traits of Paul J. Gernert, the new
parole head, and in so doing, I dug into the re-
sources of my own unbiased years of observation,
actual contact and experience with this man, which
covered more than a decade. I enjoyed his food,
rode his horses, enjoyed and abused many priv-
ileges; cussed and discussed him. I have no re-
tractions to make. Basically, he was, as I knew
him, a just and honest man—even though I dis-
agreed with some of his principles at times; and
in no uncertain terms I would let him know it,
and by gosh! he actually appreciated it. In one
specific instance, Mr. Gernert prosecuted me for
Prison Breach and, when the case came before the
Court, he asked the sentencing judge to let me
down as lightly as possible because he felt the 60
days in solitary confinement squared things away
and all he wanted from the Court was something
in the way of a ‘‘deterrent’’ for future candidates.
Shortly thereafter, he assigned me to work on the
prison farm and dared me to ‘‘take off’’. I was
chicken!

Gratitude

The inmates of ESP hereby wish to express
their appreciation to Lt. Col. Mingle, Deputy
Warden, for arranging an early mess to facilitate
viewing of the Annual All-Star baseball game on
TV. There was a capacity attendance with §.R.O.
In further appreciation, the inmates wish to assure
continued high regard for this privilege, which re-
quires absolutely no surveillance.

Blood Donors

Recently, due to a new policy of the institution,
it has been necessary to obtain blood from the
American Red Cross when it is needed for operative
procedures and other purposes. At least 75% of
the blood needed is now obtained from them.

On July 3, 1956, the American Red Cross visited
the institution for the purpose of obtaining blood
for their program. A total of 85 inmates volun-
teered. Of this number, 16 were rejected for one
reason or another, leaving a total of 69 pints that
were accepted. They will again visit the insti-
tution sometime in December of this year and we

hope enough inmates will volunteer as donors to
surpass the 69 pints that were donated in July.

‘‘Something Unbelievable’”’

What does a man have to do to qualify for re-
lease? Make a commutation? Pepe Guida, D-5083,
Lifer, had his sentence commuted in June, 1955.
Make parole? The Board granted his parole a year
ago! As Pepe says, ‘“‘This is something un-
believable!’’

And it really is.

This little old white-haired gentleman has
served 17 years. For approximately 14 of those 17
years he has had a detainer placed against him for
deportation back to his native land, Italy. 28 times
Pepe had crossed back and forth from Italy to
America. In both countries he owned small busi-
nesses. All his passages were legal and above board.
Each entry into America was simon pure. But he
is an alien. The government wants him deported.

Because of these facts, when Pepe applied for
commutation he willingly agreed to return to Italy.
When finally granted clemency, after some half
dozen attempts, his Charter read that he was to be
released subject to completed arrangements for de-
portation. Sounds simple enough, doesn’t it?

Yet here he sits in mental anguish and confusion
as month after month passes by. He is willing to
pay his way (hell, he is willing to walk back to
Italy!); the Dept. of Immigration and the Dept.
of Justice say he must go; the Italian Ambassador
and the Philadelphia Consul agree; The Ministeri
Degli Esteri in Rome gives its approval; his sister
in Naples waits for him; he lives from day to day,
and dies a little every day.

International red tape? Where is it? How is it
obstructing what everyone wants and has approved?
How does it operate that nationally known gangsters
slip through its tangle with no trouble at all and a
little old man sits by his window in the Treatment
Office, waiting—since June 1955—to go home....
where all the authorities say he belongs.

Dope Peddlers’ License Fee: $5,000 - $15,000?

The wheels of justice, as it is presently insti-
tuted, are cumbersome and uncertain. Enough go
that many junkies and pushers, too, come back for
a second and third time, and even more. As chemi-
cals go, heroin, morphine and cocaine are so cheap
as to be almost valueless substances, like aspirin.
Yet because there are a number of men and women
