but shells of the men they once were or the men they
might have been.

The figure lures the long termer and he gauges the
chances his petition for clemency would have running
the gauntlet of his detractors only to realize the fu-
tility of such an effort. Later, he learns of master
plans on the drawing boards of the penologists
throughout the nation which will revise and reorgan-
ize the existing penal setup. At long last the centuries
old system of penology will be overhauled and one-
man rule will be replaced by enlightened and pro-
gressive policies. A new day will dawn, a new phase,
new phrases, new policies and programs will be
effected.

The long termer awaits hopefully, aware that which
the Gods would destroy they must first create. With-
in a few short years the dust again settles and he
wonders if, in the interim, his status has undergone a
change. He is advised he must first divorce himself
from his past before a change in his status can be
considered. He reflects on his past with a memory
dulled by it and wonders how one divorcees oneself
from a past that has become a stigma. The longer he
remains confined, his chances for release decrease. A
victim of disparity of justice he has been consigned
to the scrap heap of life and in time becomes resigned
to his fate which adds up to nothing. He will not be
numbered among the statistical 98% nor be a part of
the myth that each was born to be free for his con-
demnation embraces the decay of the soul. And this
the penalty he must pay for the commission of a non-
heinous crime when a moderate term of punishment

would not only have been adequate but humane as
well.

Thus does disparity of sentence, punishment and
clemency not only serve to render its victim less
human in nature but by so doing creates a mockery
of justice for without equity justice becomes injustice.

What price complacency? Why endless years of
imprisonment as a penalty for a non-heinous type of
erime when within minutes a uniform sentence law
ean be drafted abolishing for all time disparity, in-

equity and the infamous caste system of justice pre-
vailing for centuries past.

Is it not time to raise the curtain of irony conceal-
ing this complacency and examine the policies or lack
of them which generates injustice, prerequisite to a
higher moral climate than has been written into the
pages of history?

The age-old system of exacting vengeance from
transgressors has time and again served to produce
malignant situations that defied solution. The fal-
lacious contention that society would not be protec-
ted if humane measures were enacted into law is re-
futed by the fact society never has been protected.
The safety of the public lies in a multitude of counse-
lors other than politically-minded sycophants. Only
those gifted with compassion deserve the confidence
of the public.

What better time than the present to look for new
frontiers in the field of justice and by so doing elim-
inate the abuses that have plagued society and re-
tarded an understanding of the causes distinguishing
one way of life from another. And by so doing would
it not be reasonable to believe undesirable causes and
ill-effeets could be controlled if such an effort were
to be made? And would it not be feasible to concen-
trate more effort in determining and isolating the
factors causing the run of the mill derelicts and their
counterparts in the professions including errant office
holders, who likewise occasionally stray across that
invisible border into the world called criminal, and
institute preventive measures?

While human nature has painfully demonstrated
infallibility is not easily dispensed with, the courts,
with incredible ease, have demonstrated justice can
be dispensed with.

Among the victims of injustice there is one dom-
inant characteristic—complaceney—responsible in
no small part for the destruction of individuals and
nations alike. The individual of today who views in-
justice as of no concern may well become a victim of
complacency tomorrow. 9

In the early part of this century, Dr. J. William White, was a resident physician in
ESP and later became a member of the Board of Inspectors. In his will, he provided
that a certain amount of money be placed in trust to be used by the institution for
the prisoner whose term expired during the year; who had undergone his first term of
penal servitude, whether here or in any other prison; who was under 25 years of age
or over 65 years of age and who was selected by the authorities as a most deserving
and most likely to be of permanently honest ways. This man was to be given the
income of this fund. Dr. White did this in remembrance of his service as a resident
physician and later as inspector of this institution.

This fund has been reactivated and the Girard Trust Corn Exchange Bank is the
present trustee under the terms of the recent adjudication it is our procedure to
certify to the Commissioner who shall receive this award. This will be an annual
award and for the year 1960 | certified that Angelo Miccolas be awarded the $100,
because in our opinion he met the conditions of Dr. White's will.

Each year, therefore, the staff will recommend the individual whose term has ex-
pired during the year and this, in turn, shall be forwarded by the Superintendent tor
the Commissioner, who will certify the name of the nominee to the trustee for the

award.
