seems to be such an important factor in the hiring of
help in outside labor.’’ This is only a brief portion
of the total thoughts expressed. However they pre-
sent an opinion that lends emphasis to prison labor.
Labor can only be as strong as the men performing
it. The most distressing part of prison labor is the
failure of outside agencies to co-ordinate their efforts
toward giving the prisoner a chance to execute his
newly acquired skills. The important question that
should be directed to the individual is, can he do the
job? This question is thought of by the employer if
the man is just out of high school, college or any in-
stitute of learning. Does it really matter where he
acquired his skill if it fits the particular need of the
employers business? All too often the man is evalu-
ated in retrospect. This type of evaluation is fine for
the psychologist and psychiatrist who must study the
man as a sum total. It is slightly below the employers
reasoning to employ men on such a bias basis. We are
well aware of the many persons in society who are
intelligent and liberal minded enough to understand
the importance of skilled labor regardless of site of
acquirement. T’o these individuals go a vote of thanks
and accomplishment.

A learned man of law stated in an article to this
magazine sometime ago the following words: ‘‘Thus
within the limitations imposed upon such officials by
an “‘Enlightened’’ public a part time job is all that
ean be offered—(In prison). But upon release from
prison the inmate is expected to go forth and work
a full 40 hour week in accordance with his parole
plan. He may well be physically able to work such
hours but is he mentally conditioned for it? I think
ON. ””

This personage’s general opinion seems to be that,
years of part time labor detracts from the willingness
of inmates mentally to fulfill a 40 hour job week in
society. I am not fully in accord with this gentle-
man’s opinions. Labor is a function not designed for
materialistic values only. It is the practical results
of man’s great ability to think and hence to create.
This is a semi-instinctive reaction which can be noted
in the early infantile behavior of children. The will-
ineness, desire and liking for the specific task should

surmount the time element. Of course there are limi-
tations in all things. Even the human body’s produe-
tive and functional processes cannot continue cease-
lessly, so the time limit in hours are measured accord-
ingly. If the particular individual does not have the
incentive for labor in prison then 1 hour is too much
for this specific type in socicty. The great strides
made within this institution in the last 7 years voca-
tionally and academically is proof of the adjusting
qualities of man. Man does not always reeognize
constructive changes for the values they represent.
In prison labor we must acquaint the man with the
basic fundamentals in order to qualify him for overall
practical use in society. The idea of adjustment is
not a new process in the prisoner’s life. When
stricken from society he is forced to adjust to an ab-
normal environment. He adjusts to regimentation
and persons not of his own choosing. If he cannot
adjust himself to 3 or 4 hours extra (The regular 8
hour work day) then he has suffered a great catas-
trophic reversal. Then he has only deluded himself
in thinking he has reached a state of rehabilitation.

The environment of prison though seemingly not
a place conducive to creativity is in reality an insti-
tute of learning in its may facets of definition. There
are, of course, going to be comparisons of the indi-
vidual labor programs within the individual prisons.
Many prisons are large and more adequately equip-
ped with the tools and facilities of the commercial
trade. Of course the size of any institution should
not limit its ability to provide the men with decent
and adequate labor conditions within any prison. One
of the many questions asked by the prisoner’s family
is, “‘ What type of work are you doing?’’ It is asked
in many ways but the overall meaning is still loud
and clear. Is the particular institution giving the
particular man the particular job to suit his partieu-
lar needs? The outlook for prison labor seems to be
progressing. It is far from what it should be but by
the same token, far from what it has been. Many of
society’s great minds realize that the man in prison
is a productive organizm which must be nurtured and
molded in a skilled and creative individual, ready to
step out into the outside world’s productivity, @

THE CLOCK OF LIFE

The clock of life is wound but once, and no man has the power

To tell just where the hands will stop, at late or early hour.
To lose one’s wealth is sad indeed, to lose one’s health is more.

To lose one’s soul is such a loss, as no man can restore.

The present only is our own, live, love, toil with a will.

Place no faith in tomorrow, for the clock, may then be still.
