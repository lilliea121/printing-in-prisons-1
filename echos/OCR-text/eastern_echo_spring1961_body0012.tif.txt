any real insight into its full significance or conse-
quences. It has been argued that ‘‘knowing’’ denotes
not only insight into such significance of the act, but
also the ability to make use of such knowledge. Ap-
parently no American court has construed the word-
ing this broadly. But if such an interpretation were
ably contended for by counsel, might a court accept
it? And if it did, might interpretation be upheld on
appeal? Does the wording of the rule clearly exclude
it?

The word ‘‘wrong’’ is patently ambiguous. Does it
mean morally wrong, or illegal? Does the man who
knew the act was against the law, but who heard di-
vine voices commanding him to do it, know that it
was wrong? A few cases have held one way—and a
few have held the other.

The result has been described by a New York
judge: ‘‘. . . as learned a charge as the judges try
to make, each interpreting the statute in his own way,
each being fortified by precedent, each trying to lay
down the correct legal test of responsibility, it is a
poor lawyer who cannot find some flaw in it upon
which to argue for reversal.”’

How ean we eall this a clear and definite test, when
its wording’ means nothing at all to psychiatrists, and
means one thing to one judge and something else to
another?

We are finally coming around to realizing that the
right and wrong test is not the clear and certain
formula it was once supposed. Moreover, we are
realizing that certainty is in any event a wild goose
that we may as well give up chasing. There is no clear
and simple rule for making discriminations that are
inherently complex and difficult.

This realization has apparently been brought home
even to die-hard supporters of the right and wrong
test, and in consequence have made an interesting
shift in their position. Instead of the old argument
that the traditional test is clear and definite, they
now tell us that, rightly understood, it is broad and
flexible enough to cover all the cases that ought to be
covered. Or, they say, at least in practice it is loose
enough to permit juries to work out rough justice. A
British psychiatrist testifying before the Royal Com-
mission on Capital Punishment presented this view
with engaging frankness. ‘‘To put it in rather a bald
way,’ he said, ‘“‘the present rules are such nonsense
in many cases that the people can exercise their own
common sense, whereas with more precise rules more
rigidly interpreted the ultimate effect would not be
as good as the present ones.’’

But it seems preferable to say with Mr. Justice
Frankfurter that to have rules that can be justified
only by a process of interpretation that distorts and
practically nullifies them is not a desirable system,
and that “‘the M’Naghten Rules are in large mea-
sure shams.’’

The eminent staff and committee of the American
Law Institute that has been drafting a Model Penal

Code, although it has rejected the Durham Case Rule
because it is allegedly too indefinite, has proposed a

10

formulation which abandons any attempt to obtain
definiteness. The Code’s main provision dealing with
mental irresponsibility, as tentatively approved by
the Institute, provides as follows: ‘‘A person is not
responsible for criminal conduct if at the time of such
conduct as a result of mental disease or defect he
lacks substantial capacity either to appreciate the
criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct
to the requirements of law.’’

It will be seen that this wording adheres to the
essence of the right and wrong test although it makes
some important changes in wording. In addition, it
supplements that test by adding impairment of vo-
litional capacity as a test.

he most significant change in the right and
wrong test that the Code formula would
make is provided by the insertion of the word
‘‘substantial,’’ so as to require only that the
defendant lack ‘‘substantial’’ capacity to ap-
preciate the criminality of his conduct or to
conform to the requirements of law. The Code drafts-
men are quite right in saying that the old test, which
seems to require total impairment of the cognitive
faculty to absolve a defendant, is unsound. “‘ Nothing
makes the inquiry into responsibility more unreal for
the psychiatrist than the limitation of the issue to
some ultimate extreme of total incapacity, when
clinical experience reveals only a graded scale with
marks along the way.’’

This is obviously a complete abandonment of the
old argument for the right and wrong test, that it
gives the jury a clear and definite rule. And what
now becomes of the main objection to the Durham
Rule, that it fails to give the jury any such definite
rule? No rule can be more indefinite than one which
would require a jury to draw a line between sub-
stantial and insubstantial capacity. This difficulty
was mentioned at the Institute meeting which ap-
proved the formulation adopted.

Professor Herbert Wechsler, the reporter in charge
of the Code project, would have preferred to go even
further and leave it to the jury to say whether the
defendant was so mentally incapacitated that he can-

In pointing out that the Model Code formulation
leaves the test vague and indefinite, I am not voicing
any adverse criticism. On the contrary, I am con-
vineed that a clear and specific formula would neces-
sarily be too rigid to be psychiatrically sound. Mental
disorder manifests itself in too many different forms
to permit any simple and inclusive definition of what
manifestations shall suffice to exculpate from respon-
sibility. I point out these ambiguities only because the
Code draftsmen have given as their reason for reject-
ing the Durham Case Rule that it is ambiguous.

If the legal profession can once disabuse itself of
the notion that a clear and definite test of ‘‘insanity’’
is either possible or desirable, we can perhaps come
around to facing frankly the fact that what we are
