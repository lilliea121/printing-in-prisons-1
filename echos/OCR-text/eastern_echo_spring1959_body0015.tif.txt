FESTIVAL OF MUSIC

During the winter months, the first show of the season was presented by the inmates of Hastern State.
Advance notices had been posted on all bulletin boards, informing all that this would be a festival of music.
This proved to be true with an added attraction in the contrasting styles and beats,—real Dixieland Jazz, a
combination of Rock n’ Roll and Country Music, plus the sounds of two big bands. Hach group was well
augmented with vocalists, instrumentalists and individual artists.

Not much more can be said about our “Festival of Music,” except to say that everyone in attendance thor-
oughly enjoyed the program and our thanks go to everyone who helped to make this day a little happier. The
men showed their appreciation by the thunderous applause given the entertainers. We’ll all sit back, anxi-
ously awaiting that welcome call, “It’s Show Time!” once again.
