agricultural islands off its coast. Not one of these
countries had any luck in their transportation enter-
prises and all gave the practice up.

Meanwhile, back in England, where the shipping of
convicts to the colonies was becoming an economic
venture, besides solving the problem of criminal over-
flow. The masters of the vessels that transported the
felons was empowered to sell them as labor on the
hoof to the colonists and the money was channeled
back to the British treasury. The fact that this made
virtual slaves of the convicts did not trouble the
erown in the least.

When the revolutionary war released America
from the English yoke, the British found themselves
overstocked with this low-priced labor device and
ended up shipping them to Australia. Since there
were no settlers on the Continent of Australia, the
convicted men were allowed to labor for themselves.
At first there was complete chaos but eventually the
more levelheaded inmates got the upperhand and the
venture started to work. Though Kngland discon-
tinued the Transportation system for supposedly eco-
nomic reasons, it would appear that men such as
Archbishop Richard Whately had more than a little
to do with its abolishment. Whately protested that
the criminal, by his toil, was afforded the chanee to
become self-supporting and self-respecting.

In the 18th century, France came up with its own
inimitable ideas on transportation when she began
shipping men to the penal colony of French Guiana,
a charming island paradise that was joshingely tagged
Devils Island by the residents. The work in this col-
ony was usually confined to the repairing and build-
ine of roads that went nowhere and felling timber.
Rene Belbenoit paints an idylie scene of these labors
in his novel, Dry Guillotine.

“One has to see these ragged creatures trooping
off into the jungle, their fect bare, carrying their axes
awkwardly, (many of the prisoners are from the
cities in France and have never had an axe in their
hands before) with just a half-pint of black coffee in
their stomachs, to realize the depths of despair to
which they have sunk. Drenched in perspiration,
striking with all their might at trees which are often
so hard they turn the edges of the axe, they sob and
swear; they know nothing of jungle timber, and will
try valiantly to cut down a tree which steel will bare-
ly bite into. One should see them at noon, working
continuously in the hot sun or in the close mushy
dampness under the shadows of the great trees, with
sweat streaming from every pore, and mosquitoes
biting every inch of exposed flesh; working frantic-
ally to have their tasks finished so as to get something

to eat. And when they have returned to camp all

wet, there are no clothes to change into for they have
none; they have either bartered them away for ne-
cessities or someone has stolen them before they came
into camp.”

Iiven more inhumane than Devils Island was the
Russian colony of Siberia. The men sent to work in
this wasteland were given a one-way ticket and could
expect to never return to their homes again, if they
were fortunate enough to stand the trek there in the
first place.

It appeared that new methods of using prison labor
would have to be found and several countries came
up with the same identical idea at about the same
time. The Workhouse !

The English lay modest claim to this perverted idea
because of a workhouse erected in a section of Lon-
don called Bridewell. This House of Correction is
mentioned in the book, The Criminal Prisons of Lon-
don, by Mayhew and Binney

y

“Where the city Bridewell now stands there is said
to have been anciently a holy well of medicinal wa-
ters called St. Bride’s Well, upon which was founded
a hospital for the poor. After the reformation, Ed-
ward VI chartered this to the city and converted it
into a place of confinement and “penitentiary amend-
ment” for unruly apprentices and disorderly persons
as well as sturdy beggars and vagrants.”

Originally, Bridewell had been built to house the
emperor Charles V, and his suite in 1525. It is doubt-
ful that the new tenants found it as hospitable as
Charles did, for they were put to work at such indus-
trious pursuits as spinning, making nails, and egrind-
ine corn. More about this grinding corn in a few
minutes. To improve the consciences of the Bride-
well inmates there were several forms of discipline.
Among them, whipping, restriction of dict and sun-
dry tortures.

Since the first workhouse was a success, as far as
officialdom was concerned, the idea took hold and in
1567 Parliament ruled that each county should have
its own Bridewell. The limits of labor were inereased
and by 1579 there were some two dozen types of em-
ployment in the Bridewells, among which were the
making of tennis balls, silk, lace, and pins. The main
improvement as far as the inmates were concerned
was that they were paid for their labors.

On the continent the good burghers of Amsterdam
had finally become sickened at the shedding of erim-
inal blood and opened up a little Bridewell of their
own. Several other countries, Germany, Belgium, cte.,
Jumped on the bandwagon and the workhouse,
with all its foulness, became a part of the prison labor
system that exists, even in America, until this day.
