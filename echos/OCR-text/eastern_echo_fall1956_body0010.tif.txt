The modern, up-to-date appointment of the shop
plus the certain quality of accomplishment and
pride that is apparent in the attitude of the men
who work there make this shop attractive.

The Print Shop was one of the first shops
placed in this institution for the vocational training
of our men. Beginning with just a few job presses
and a compositor bank, not unlike the little shops
one sees in and around the neighborhooods of our
cities, it has expanded and grown to such an extent
that it now requires 4 Linotype Machines, 1 Mono-
type Keyboard and Caster and 5 Compositor Banks
to feed the work into our large pressroom. If this
shop were transplanted into the competitive field
of printing it would be capable, with trained person-
nel, of doing a gross business of $25,000 per week.
In addition to the above machines and equipment,
which is just one section of the shop, the inmates
are instructed in the use and maintenance of such
presses as 2 Miehle V-50’s, I Miehle Horizontal, 1
Miehle 00, I little Giant, 1 Style B. Kelly, a Verner
Multipress, J. M. Model, 3 Chandler & Price Crafts-
men and 1 Colt’s Armory Press. Included amongst
these are some of the newest type cylinder presses.

Our up-to-date Bindery is equipped with a
Hickok Dise Ruler, 3 Bostitch stitchers, 1 Rotary
Perforator, 1 Seybold Cutter and 1 Punching
Machine. This department can handle most any
type of bookbinding, including hand-sewed hard-
back books.

With the equipment listed above it is possible
for the men in the Print Shop to do nearly all types
of general printing. <A fine example is our copy of
the EASTERN ECHO. Note the elarity of the
characters, the perfect alignment of its pages and
columns, the use of colors, the illustrations, ete.
We would be proud to compare the general printing
of our magazine with any magazine printed in a com-
mercial house. This fine work is the result of the
pride of achievement illustrated by the men in this
shop, supervised by two very capable instructors
who are expert in all phases of printing. The in-
structors, Charles Bachman and Fred H. Tredinnick,
two extremely fine gentlemen, as well as experts in
their field, possess those essential qualities so im-

portant to the training of men, human kindness,
understanding and patience. We feel that they
contribute much to the rehabilitation of the men in
their shop. Their constant encouragement and ap-
preciation of the work that the men do instill the
men with a spirit of incentive so necessary to re-
habilitation. Many men who have left this insti-
tution have acknowledged the help that was ex-
tended to them by these gentlemen by calling them
and keeping them abreast of their work on the
street.

Mr. Tredinnick, a member with an excellent
reputation in The International Typographical
Union #2, has through the union placed many pa-
roled men as Compositors, Linotypists and Mono-
typists with various newspapers and printing houses
in Philadelphia. These men have fulfilled profess-
ional expectations to such an extent that an increas-
ing number of ealls are placed to Mr. Tredinnick for
more of his trainees. Mr. Tredinnick, true to his
craft, his union, and sincere with the men in his
charge, will not recommend any man until he is
certain that he can qualify. Six months before a
trainee is to be released he is given every type of
work imaginable not only as a test to prove him-
self worthy of his trade but as a gauge of his re-
action and attitude towards being ‘‘bossed around’’.
The reward for this period of apprenticeship is ad-
mittanee into a well-respected union and the op-
portunity of earning a salary of $102 per 37 hour-
week. Certainly a mark worth shooting for.

Our pressmen, ably supervised by Mr. Bachman,
are instructed in all phases of presswork; i. e.,
make-ready, setting a fountain, oiling and main-
taining their machine. Some of these men do work
that would be classified A-1 in any shop in the
printing industry. The only drawback that dis-
qualifies these men as Journeymen printers is the
fact that not enough of a variety of presses are
available to them. Noticeably missing are Off-set
and Multi-colored presses. If these machines were
included in our Print Shop they would enable the
men to get the necessary experience to qualify.
However, since the men are taught the basic prin-
ciples of printing they would be able, with a mini-
mum of instruction, to operate even those presses.

The Stone, a necessary and important part of
the pressroom where all the forms are ‘locked up’
for the presses, is given special attention by Mr.
Bachman for it plays an integral part in setting
up a press.

To round out the completeness of the Print
Shop, a first-rate Bindery is included. Any folder,
