It should not be complex. Fither we have a free press
with no exceptions, or we have a controlled press. We
can’t have it both ways.

No information about a man’s past record, regarding his
confession, etc., etc., etc., No information—except in cer-
tain cases, he said. Who or what decides when this excep-
tion will be made? Even when officials set up new rules,
they still want to reserve. the right to make exceptions to

pose they will “‘blast’’ a defendant?

They say their intentions are to assure a mana fair
trial. There are many other areas in which they could
concern themselves and assure a man a fair trial; many

areas far more important than suppressing pre-trial publicity.

BATTLE BETWEEN LAWYERS

They could concentrate on making a trial a thorough
seeking of the truth and less a battle of wits between
lawyers. Too many times men have gone to prison because
of clever subterfuges by prosecutors adept at withholding
from a jury information that would favor the defense. This
is also true of defense attorneys but it still is not right.
Also, many nen have gone to prison because of lack of pre-
paration or initiative on the part of their lawyers.

In a Detroit Court, a man was scheduled for sentencing
when a probation officer disclosed information that showed
the man was not guilty ofembezzlement as charged but only
of resigning in an unorthodox manner.

He had been a driver salesmen for the complaintant. He
parked a company truck in a garage. He deducted the money
collected on his route pay, which he had coming, plus the
equivalent of a cash bond on deposit with the company. He
mailed the balance of the money, the truck keys and the
parking claim check to his employer and left town.

What if the probation officer had not learned these facts?

BELATED REVELATION

In another Michigan County, halfway through a trial the
prosecutor disclosed that a jury member was the sheriff’s
brother-in-law. A mistrial was declared. Conscientious?
If the trial had been going his way would he still have made
the disclosure? It was a small town. It’s possible that the
prosecutor knew this at the beginning of the trial. It’s pos-
sible.

A few months ago, prosecutors commented on the finan-
cial burden being caused by a ruling that provided for ap-
pointment of counsel to indigents for appeals.

TAXPAYER’S BURDEN

At the same time, many prosecutors are bringing men in-
to court on new charges whenthey are already under another
sentence.

Where is the concern for the financial burden on the tax-
payer in these cases? When a man is under sentence for
five to ten years, what is to be gained by bringing him into
court for a charge that carries a four-year maximum?

The only possible gain is an impressive conviction tally

These areas are more worthy of the attention of the
American Bar Association and officialdom than the area of
pre-trial publicity.

SOME WRONGS EXPOSED

The sins of both sides are plentiful. Likewise, there
are credits to both. Newsmen have vindicated many wrongly
imprisoned men. Many lawyers have conscientiously left no
stone unturned and sucessfully sought the truth to the bene-
fit of imprisoned men. But they, like the cases affected by
pre-trial publicity, are in the minority.

THE RULES OF SOCIETY

We are taught that to steal is morally wrong. If we steal,
we will be punished. These are the rules of our society.
This is the way it should be.

The rules of our society also allow for freedom of the
press and fair trials. A more conscientious effort on both
sides would sustain these rules. :

Until this utopian goal is reached, if this writer were
faced with a choice, it might be better to be at the mercy of
the news media—as embarrassing as it might be—than to be
at the mercy of offialdom if they were permitted to operate
