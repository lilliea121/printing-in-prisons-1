Sell Sc Praise recogmzed by

National Civil Defense Bureau

by Martin Lees

A modicum of praise should be channeled in the
direction of the men who completed the exacting and
trying course of the Civil Defense Emergency Medical
Self-trainnmg Program.

The classes were under the personal supervision of
Doctor Nathan Blumberg, Medical Director of this
institution, ably assisted by Sgt. Ronald J. Marks.

The program was first instituted on December 12,
1962, and consisted of one hour per week over a |2
week period. There were |2 separate phases to the
completed program, consisting of:

1. Radio Active Fall-Out

Hygiene, Sanitation and Vermin Control
Water and Food

Shock

Bleeding and Bandaging

Artificial Respiration

Transportation

Fractures and Splinting

Burns

SO MN DY RY HD

Nursing Care of Sick and Injured
Emergency Child Care
12. Emergency Child Birth

Each separate phase consisted of lectures and a
series of illustrated motion picture slides, plus books
and instruction pamphlets to be studied on each sub-
ject. At the completion of the course, a written ex-
amination was required.

The Civil Defense Program has provided the
institution with a group of men who under abnormal
circumstances will be able to act rationally and apply
what they have been taught, with the required skill.

Eastern Echo

The National Civil Defense Bureau is cognizant of
the effort extended by these men and recognize their
importance and vital function inside these four walls.

We all hope there will never be a need for these
men to participate in a National Emergency; however
—they are prepared.

On December 11, 1962 the initial group of grad-
uates were awarded Certificates of Achievement by

Dr. Nathan Blumberg, M.D., and Superintendent

A. T. Rundle.
