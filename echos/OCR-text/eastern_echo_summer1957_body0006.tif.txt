When a crime is committed, it. is committed by
an individual. It has been partially ascertained in
some fields, that sometimes the individual fits the
crime he commits and sometimes the crime fits the
individual. But it is my contention that, under the
present system, though penalties may fit the crime,
they do not fit the individual.

Penologists today stress that individuality is a
much wanted thing in dealing with criminology, its
meanings and ramifications. However, under the
penalty system of today the individuality of the
prisoner is considered, in large, only after sentenc-
ing, when and if he is committed to an institution to
serve his time which has the various treatment
facilities incorporated into its program. There is
no noticeable concern prior to sentencing with eval-
uating the intricate relations between the man and
his crime, to discover why the individual fitted the
crime, or the crime, the individual. Without this
knowledge and understanding it is no surprise that
(1) the crime a man commits is the major considera-
tion in passing sentence—thus, the sentence is for
the crime; (2) nevertheless a man must serve the
sentence his crime deserves, whereas he himself may
actually merit a shorter or longer period of confine-
ment... as, not the case may be, but he himself may
be.

I do not propose to saddle the courts with the
specialists’ job of evaluating every defendant who
comes before them. Such may be grossly out of
line with the average jurist’s training and qualifica-
tions. Certainly extensive pre-sentence investiga-
tion would also increase the notorious backlog of
our courts a thousand fold. Rather I submit for the
consideration of everyone, layman and professional,
alike, an alternative solution which would (1) enable
the courts to function under their present setup,
with penalty adjusted to crime and nature of the
crime; (2) and yet incorporate into the structure of
the sentence all the considerations of individuality
which modern concepts of both penalization and
treatment demand.

Let us assume that defendant John Doe, upon
conviction of robbery, instead of receiving the cus-
tomary sentence in terms of years, is handed an
automatic penalty fitted to the crime: that 1s to say,
the judge explains, ‘‘You have been convicted of the
crime of armed robbery, the automatic penalty for
which is 1,200 points. In order to obtain and re-
main on parole, you must accumulate and retain a
minimum of 600 points in the manner prescribed by
the law, and at the rate determined by the Board of
Evaluation at the Diagnostic Center to which you
are hereby committed.’’

Thus John Doe hus been tried for the crime by
experts in the law. The sentence he received was
fitted to the crime, yet inherent in that sentence is
the provision that it may be fitted to John Doe by a
board of specialists trained to evaluate him as an in-
dividual.
