BY MAN

The ugliness one sees
in the world
is Beauty and Truth
horribly mutilated
by man
using the hammer and chisel
of greed and tyranny...

MONARCH INVINCIBLE

Carved by»the tireless hand of time,
the grey bluff, its bold steep face deéply searred,
stands with cleft feet tightly imbedded
in the cold sands of antiquity
and stares stoically out over the heaving breast
of.the restless sea;

the rising sun adorns itSscrown
with a ¢lorious.halo,

drapes a garment of soft spun @old
over its wide shoulders

and earesses its granite cheeks
with compassionate warmth;

white tipped wavelets race mérrily along the shore
and caress its feet playfully,

and a rhythmic song of the sea rises and faHs
on the placid wings of a breeze,

while harmony pervadés the atmosphere
to encircle its massive form

withthe gentle arms of quietude. . .

VICTORY

When daylight softly walks
aeross the; misty hills of morn
and! bathes the earth
with tranquil rays of light
it holds aloft in yewelled hand
the glowing torch
of victory over night. . ,

THOUGHTS
OF
HARRY

A rancorous-wind, wearing the scarlet robe of chaos}

creeps from its ethereal edifice
and beats with, implacable fury
against its roughly hewn brow;

white-erested waves beat furiously upon the shore,

and pouring rains drench its erown
and swift runiing..rivulets cut»decper
the-yagged scars in its rugged face;

the fog sweeps in.on wraithlike wings;
clings to its massive form with, sticky fingers,
and stifles day
with a tightly woven net.of grey mist,
which only the wailing voice of the wind
and the raucous shrick of a gull
seem able to penetrate ;

but if-one listens closely enough
avoicerfrem the bluff ¢an be heard to say,

ZONA TO

**Tam Man! Invincible.Momarch of the Universe!’?

ARISE AND WALK

aA tiny blade of grass

will rise again

E when crushed by tempests,

ice, and rain;

| so why can’t man ariée,

when crushed by fear and strife

EB _and firmly walk, hig eyes on stars,

the fruitful road of life. . .

PARABLES

Hie who has no perception of love
and creates for himself

a world) of ugliness
will ultimately creat¢

his own darkness
and .petish therein. 4.

and he\ who hates another —
shall build beneath

the altar of his own soul
a self-consuming flame. . .
