Lengthening his stride to keep up with the
youngster’s fast pace, he followed and pushed his
way through the crowd gathered in front of Ichi-
guro’s house. On the floor, by the usual household
shrine, lay an old man clad in a ragged ceremonial
toga. His frail fingers were clutching at the blood-
stain which covered the front of his body and he
muttered softly to himself.

‘“What’s his name?’’ asked the interpreter.

One of the villagers replied, ‘‘Ichiguro Watan-
abe-san.”’

The corporal bent over and removed the old
man’s hands from the wound. He could see that
help was impossible. The man was going to die.
He asked softly, ‘‘Why did you do it?’’

Ichiguro stared at him with tired eyes and whis-
pered, ‘‘They slighted my house. How could I live
after they slighted my house?”’

Instinetively understanding, the corporal held
the man’s white-haired head in his lap and said no-
thing. All was quiet except for a hammering which
had suddenly commenced at the door. A woman
darted through the crowd clutching a piece of paper
in her hand. The people made a passage for her as
she went to the dying man and silently placed it in
his fingers. He raised it to his eyes and peered at
the strange, unknown writing. He looked from the
mysterious paper to the corporal with desperate
longing in his glance.

He asked, ‘‘ Does this mean they have discovered
their mistake and want my home after all?’’

The corporal took the paper from his trembling
fingers and after reading it said, ‘‘Yes, papa-san,
they say they are proud to be able to use your fine
home.” :

‘‘Domo arigato gozaimasu,’’ said Ichiguro, as he
closed his eyes. A tremor shook his body and only
the smile upon his wrinkled face gave evidence that
he had died happy and with good face.

The interpreter rose and slowly left the house.
As he returned to the jeep, he looked at the paper
with its bold, black print before throwing it to the
ground. There it lay for all the villagers to see but
not to understand.

PAROLE QUESTIONS

QUESTION:

If an inmate exhausts all his contacts and can-
not get a job to complete his parole plan, will he still
be paroled if he has sufficient funds to support him-
self until he can find a job? Will a sponsor and home
still be required for this type of release?

ANSWER:

Yes, but a period of between three and six
months must first elapse after release date has been
established (or minimum expiration) by the Parole
Board, and the inmate must exhaust all of his pos-
sible contacts. Then he should notify me and at the
time of notification he must present to me a list of
all persons contacted regarding employment. This
information is then presented to the Institution Staff.
Should they approve his release, a report is then sub-
mitted to the Parole Board and they must approve
the report before release can be had. Inmate must
have advisor and home.

QUESTION:

How long does it take to investigate an out-of-
state parole plan?
ANSWER:

This depends largely upon the state doing the
investigation. We allow between three and four
months for the southern states and perhaps two or

16

three for the northern states. However, these are
only approximate.
QUESTION:

What is the procedure in Parole Plan investi-
gations?
ANSWER:

When the inmate has turned into the Parole
Office letters on his complete plan or we receive them
direct from the parties concerned, we then send out
an investigation request along with letters to the
District Office covering the territory of the plan.
The agent assigned to this district does the investi-
gating, types out his report, signs it, as does the
Asst. District Supervisor, and the report is then
mailed to the Parole Board in Harrisburg, Pa. The
Board, following the next executive session, notifies
us of its acceptance or rejection.
