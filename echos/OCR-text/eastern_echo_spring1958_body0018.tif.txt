makeup of the magazine. As for his art work, I
believe some of his covers carried greater impact
and message than any around the circuit.

Between Jim at one end of the long table, and
myself at the other, sat the most enthusiastic and
wonderful group of fellow workers on anybody’s
staff in the country. Men such as Steve Poltorak,
Jesse Birch, Harold Shadd, Hank Myers, Harry W.
Johnson, John Williams, William Cressman, Francis
Murphy and L. J. Biancone certainly made my job
a pleasure. Together we initiated the actions for
building our bridge of understanding between pris-
oner and the local public; together we added new
features (Conversation, For Consideration, For the
ECHO Record, Snoopy, Dear Reader, Inside Cover
message, etc.) and brought ECHO along carefully.

A. few other factors that lay behind the Word
as this former editor saw and spoke it:

I had always been deeply impressed by the
character and writing of another prisoner active on
the staff of another institution’s magazine. The late
Tom Runyon of Iowa State’s PRESIDIO, and to me
the Light of Penal Press itself, had that indefinable
something we call class. His policy (as well as pres-
ent PRESIDIO editor, Bob Neese’s), ‘‘to speak for
the prisoner rather than to him’’ impressed itself
in my mind as the best for helping forgotten men
put their best feet forward, and to work with esprit
de corps. To bolster his view, my staff and advisors
constantly reminded me that Eastern prisoners hard-
ly relished attempts at ‘‘preaching’’ to them by...
other felons. In our staff meetings we thrashed the
matter out in this wise: talking to our fellows could
only alienate the reader group whose interest and
backing we were most sensitive to. Further, we in-
mates could talk to each other for the next one
hundred years and accomplish nothing, whereas one
civilian befriended represented one real influence in
our behalf which could help us ... who could not
help ourselves.

Thus might Runyon himself have reasoned. But
in any event, he and I and all of us wound up with
the same conclusion no matter how we severally
arrived at it.

And as Biancone has many times remarked,
‘‘In this one aspect of your editorial policy alone
lay the success of ECHO.’’ Which may or may not
be so. Certainly, we knew it was important.

With this, the personal concept of presenting
the prisoner as ‘‘a whole man.’’ Not just his opin-
ions or protests, but his heart, his wit, his captive
but uneaptured soul. To make friends for him every-
where by helping him to be seen as a complete hu-
man being. At least to try.

And with this, the personal belief that even
crime is finally a problem in the field of human re-

16

lations. Which tended to divest crime and the crim-
inal of some of the mystery and fatalism associated
with both. As if certain members of society were
born or meant to “‘go wrong.”’

And with this, the knowledge that harsh punish-
ment breeds more crime and more atrocious crime.
That kindness and progressive penology do pay.

With this, as exemplified in three lines of a
quatrain from Miss Rose Grano’s Christmas card:

‘“Dear Father hear and bless

And guard with tenderness
Small things that have no words.’’

It forever seemed to me that all prisoners every-
where, no matter their strength, ability to endure,
their hearts made hard by adversity and the pain of
a Barnum and Bailey world, their minds narrowed
in the experience of always caution—it forever
seemed to me that we were all akin to ‘‘Small things
that have no words.’’ Because of the prisoner situa-
tion itself, our greatest deeds are, in the end, in-
effective little things. Our whisperings and shouts,
whether in court writs or prison magazines, they
seldom communicate what it is we wish to say. Even
our men of empire, our eagles, wolves and tigers,
end in being more manipulated than alive.

No one can really help prisoners along the way,
or speak for them, as if to help them touch each oth-
er as well as free, small-thing other men. But the
prisoners I had known, by and large, deserved more

.. and if there was to be a crusade, it seemed most
unmediately then and there.

Occasionally, this approach may have skirted
sentimentality. Certainly it colored my own issues
with a somewhat rosy hue—as if we prisoners were
just a bunch of very nice guys. Against this, howe
ever, I saw an American free press largely and co-
lossally dedicated to picture us at the other extreme
as absolute villains. In light of that, my whatever
excesses seemed justified.

In retrospect, I see myself as ECHO’s third and
longest serving editor as an ingratiating, small-
thing crusading, language-conscious editor. Growing
more so with each issue. And as a man whose staff
operated with such loyalty that he was made to look
much better at this business than he ever really was.

In two years, eight issues of this magazine through
Winter of 757, after which issue I stepped down, I
would list these features and mile-posts as each in
some way most significant:

The abortive first founding of ECHO in Septem-
ber of 1955.
The Jerry Culp editorial, March 1956 issue.

Some of the stands taken by Joe Corvi, our
second editor.
