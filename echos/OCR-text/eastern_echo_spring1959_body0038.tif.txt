MISGUIDED MISSILES

Office, in whose district the man was sentenced. The
Judge who sentenced him and the complainant or
plaintiff, are all notified that the individual prisoner
has applied for his release. In most cases, his request
for commutation is unopposed by these parties.
However, all facts — pro or con— are presented ‘to
the Board of Pardons for their approval or dis-
approval. The Commutation Board will set a date
upon which the individual’s case will be heard. At
this time, arguments are heard—for and against - the
applicant. If three (3) of the four (4) Board
members agree to approve his request for commuta-
tion — then — and only then —it reaches the desk
of the Governor. )

To ask why the Governor of our State would sign
such requests, after they have traveled this circuitous
route, is to ask why the President of The United
States would approve a Bill that has been previously
approved by The House of Representatives, The
United States Senate, The Supreme Court and each
of his Cabinet Members. Certainly, the Governor
should have confidence in the research and fact
findings of his staff and their subordinates.

The percentage of successful rehabilitative efforts
seems to justify the actions of the Parole Board,
Pardons Board and Governor Leader. However,
contrary to the aforementioned percentages, the
editorial of December 11th advised that the Dope
Pusher quickly returned to his villainous traffie upon
receiving commutation. Mention was made of Sex-
Criminals and Hold-Up men as well. It was indicated
that all of these men were immediately going to set
up shop in the old store. Naturally, if the editoria-
lists had investigated the parole percentages more
thoroughly, they would realize the figures included
men who had been originally convicted of such
crimes.

No man is released from prison (unless he has
completed his maximum sentence) until all authorities
believe that he has the intent, will, equipment and
determination to become a good citizen. Men on

parole are subject to rules and regulations, as well as
surveillance, above and beyond the ordinary rules
and regulations cf social conformity. Our system of
Penology, which seems to be under ridicule, is being
used as a criterion by foreign countries. Our sen-
tences are more severe than those issued in other
countries (of similar moral ethics) for identical
crimes. The newspaper headlines assume tabloid pro-
portions and style in announcing the release of men
via the method of commutation. They use the
words ““MURDERERS RELEASED and DOPE
PUSHERS SET FREE’’. However, they do not
advise that all of the factors or, only a part of the
man’s sentence has been reduced. A man released
on commutation of his Minimum Sentence is far
from being a free man. He is released into the
custody of Parole Authorities until his maximum has
expired. Therefore, a man who has a sentence of from
20 to 40 years, and is released on commutation after
serving 15 years, must remain on parole for 25 years.
One slip, and he will be returned to prison. This
may mean that he will have to serve the remaining 25
years in Jail. In the case of a “lifer”, he must re-
main on Parole for the rest of his life. The life of a
man on parole can never be misconstrued with
freedom.

I could go on, and on, by introducing fact after
fact that support the recent commutations as being
sound judgment. Mistakes in judgment have been
made in the past. That is not denied. Nor is it
denied that there will be mistakes made in the future.
No system is infallible. However, the percentage
figures are an overwhelming testimony to the sound-
ness of the overall Commutation System, and to those
who administer it.

In view of the constant unsupported attacks, I
was curious as to the platform adopted by the news-
papers. So, I read one. It was impressive, noble,
and one of high morality and ethies. It is possessed
of the same granite qualities of the Platforms from
which we launch our Guided Missiles. Unfortunately,
the products launched from the respective Platforms
are not as accurate as we would have them. They
wobble and go off course. In some eases, the mis-
euided missiles have created havoe with their beauti-
ful, staunch Platforms. — THE END

“Prison terms are too long and too little is known of the potential moral and
spiritual growth to criminals,” said Rabbi Joshua S. Sperke, of Jackson, Michigan.

The Rabbi is the first Jewish prison chaplain in the State's history, and he is con-
vinced that, in general, lawbreakers are confined in prisons too long either for their
good, or for the good of the community.

“There comes a time in the life of almost every criminal when he has accepted
the maximun amount of treatment that he can absorb. It is then that he should be
released. Imprisonment beyond that crucial period lessens his chances to ever adjust
to life in a free society. He merely becomes bitter and apathetic,” said the Rabbi.
