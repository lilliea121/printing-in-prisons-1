to make this fast—it’s got to go tomorrow night.
Any minute the Japs may cross the river and take
over Shanghai. You know that. Look at it this way;
we take no risk, and get a hundred G’s apiece.”

She looked at me from beneath her lone black
lashes, her dark eyes brilliant in the light of the
dancing flames.

she asked.

“Certainly, ~ ll replied. “After all, he can’t hold
out on us. Where could he hide? Besides, he’s satis-
fied with his share of the loot. What I worry about
is whether the diamonds will be in the safe when
reorge cracks it open.”

“That no worry,’ she said. “Only yesterday
the Britisher gave me some family heirlooms, in the
safe to place, and everything there exactly is, as
before.”

The next day I brought the tools and the hired
car to her place. There, once again, we went over all
of the details of the job until we knew our parts
perfectly. The thought of the fortune that would be
ours in less than 24 hours made us feel like a couple
of earefree kids as we talked about what we would
do with it.

Looking at Tanya, I couldn’t help thinking what
a good combination we would make, especially if we
pooled our loot from this job. I could easily run it
up to a million on the Oriental black market. She
had often called me a smart Amerikansi, and it
inflated my already large ego to think she was
secretly in love with me. But, for my part, I was
more in love with the loot that would soon be mine
than I was with her.

what you call him? Yegg?”

It was late when I left her and got a room in a
small hotel. I awoke early and, after a quick cup
of coffee, I hurried to the ship to meet George. He
arrived about eight, carrying the canvas sack and
when he saw me, he gave a start of surprise as
though he didn’t expect to see me. Then he gave
me a dirty look.

“What's the matter, George,” I asked as I fol-
lowed him into his cabin. “Anything wrong?”

Instead of answering, he stared hard at me with
a puzzled look in his eyes. He shook his head and
pulled out a stack of English pounds from the sack
and laid them on the bed. He then got a bottle of
scotch and poured himself a large drink.

“What's wrong with you2” I asked.
“You know what’s wrong!” he shouted. “You

and that Russian bitch got the jewels. All I got is
10 G’s in Limey money.”

“You mean you haven’t got the jewels?” I de-
manded.

For a long while he stared into my eyes as
though he could find the truth in them. With a
shrug, his reply came in a sobered voice.

“I don’t know, Jack. Maybe Tanya did it by
herself. Anyway, she’s got the jewels.”

Stunned by this bit of info, I asked him to re-
late the details of the previous night.

“sure, Jack,” he said, as he poured himself
another drink. “Like you said, the joint was a push-
over. In no time I had the safe open. I grabbed
the jewel case and the 10 G’s laying on top of it and
beat it back to the car and drove to Tanya’s flat and
planted the case in the spot under the stove where
she told me to put it. Then, I drove back to the
spot on Bubbling Well Road to pick up Tanya.
While I waited for her I saw all of the cars leave
the joint and all the lights go out. I knew some-
thing was wrong then, so I sped back to her flat.

He paused for a moment and downed his drink.
Then he went on.

“Something was wrong all right. The jewel case
was gone and so was Tanya. It was almost dawn
and the ship was due to sail at ten, so there wasn’t
time for me to look for Tanya. Maybe you ean find
her. Anyway, she’s got the jewels. All I can do
Jack, is split the Limey dough with you.”

“No, you keep it George. I’m going to look
ioe “Peumyel.”

So Tanya had won. It was easy for me to sce
how she had done it. She had merely waited till
George opened the safe and left with this decoy
Jewel case and the English pounds, then she had
gone upstairs and removed the genuine jewels from
where they were deep inside the safe.

I thought P’d never see or hear from her again,
but I was wrong. For a few nights later I got this
radiogram from a ship at sea:

FORGIVE ME STOP SATLING SS. AD:

Overjoyed, I immediately booked passage on a
plant which was leaving the following afternoon on
a non-stop flight to Singapore.

But the next morning the Japs bombed Pearl
Harbor, and also sank every U.S. vessel between
Shanghai and Singapore.

The $5.8. Admiral Cole went down, and there
were no SUrVIVOrs.
