my hair pulled fiat, and the pigtails?’’

“‘Pigtails? I don’t see any,’’ John said.

‘‘Well, of course you can’t see them, but I have
them, anyway.”’

“‘T like you better without them,’’ he said.

“‘That’s Daddy’s sister Esther. She lives in
Janesville.’’ Betty turned the page and touched a
picture. ‘“‘That’s my mother, my real mother,
taken in the garden behind her home, just before I
was born.’’

John saw the picture. He felt as though he
had been struck dumb. He hardly heard Betty
chattering away. There! There on that page, was
his dream woman! The woman whose image had
haunted him all these years, and she stood just as
he always saw her in his dreams. She wore the
severe, plain black dress, and she was standing in a
garden by a rose-arbour, just as he always saw her.
She was even waving good-bye to someone, her hand
raised in a farewell gesture, a look of sadness and
pity upon her face. It was impossible! It couldn’t
be true! He tore the album from Betty’s hands and
looked closer, unable to believe his own eyes.

‘‘John!’’ Betty exclaimed, frightened. ‘‘John,
what isit? What’s wrong?”’

‘Who is this woman?’’ he gasped, choking with
emotion, unable to speak clearly.

It’s my mother,’’ Betty answered. ‘‘I just told
you.”’

“But I know her,’’ he eried, ‘‘I know this
woman! Her face has haunted me for over ten
years. I used to see her face in my dreams, and she
was always standing in just this position, she al-
ways wore just these clothes, she was waving
good-bye... !”’

“But you couldn’t know her,’’ Betty said.

“It’s impossible.”’

John turned the pages like a madman, looking
for another picture of her, anything that would
give him a clue, tell him why her face always
haunted his memory, and then he saw the house,
and piece by piece he began to remember the things
which had always eluded him before in the dreams.
He remembered standing in front of the house, look-
ing back at the woman who was waving farewell to
him from the garden. She was trying terribly to
keep from erying, but John could sense that this
was something awful and terrifying that was hap-
pening to him, and he began to ery, tried to run
back to the woman, but the man took hold of him
and wouldn’t let him go. And then, as if it had
been only yesterday, he remembered the man speak-
ing to him, saying, “‘It’s all right, sonny, don’t ery.
Your mommy’s only going to the hospital. She’s
going to pick out a little baby sister for you. We'll
bring you home again when your mother comes
back from the hospital, don’t ery,’’ but John kept
on crying and erying, he couldn’t stop; he didn’t
want his mother to go away, not even to bring him
home a little baby sister, and he started to sob con-
vulsively and scream and scream, and then the man
put him in the ear and drove away.

‘John, John, sweetheart, what is it?’’ Betty
asked, frightened by John’s sobs. He was breath-
ing heavily, looking at Betty wildly as though he
had never seen her before, staring at her with such
horror that she was confused and terrified. ‘‘ What
in God’s name is it, John? What is it?’’ she sobbed,
but John couldn’t answer her, couldn’t do anything
but stare at her in horror, and then he fell sobbing
onto the bed and buried his face in his hands,
calling again and again ‘‘Mother! Mother!’’
