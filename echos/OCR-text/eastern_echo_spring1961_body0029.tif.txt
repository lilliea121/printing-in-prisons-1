Paternal Grandparents. His grandparents, though
well-intentioned, overlooked two significant factors
in their relationship with him. They were extremely
overindulgent—a practice which is common among
grandparents, but usually has little significance be-
cause they do not have much influence upon the gen-
eral development of their grandchildren. In Nel-
son’s case they were, for all intents and purposes,
parents, and their influence was considerable. Much
more serious repercussions were to stem from the
fact that they attempted to turn Nelson against his
father because they were antagonistic towards his
religious beliefs, When Nelson was six his father re-
married, and the family was reunited.

As a result of the grandparents’ influence, Nelson
could not accept the affection showed him by his
father after the family was rejoined. The attentions
of his step-mother were even more strongly refused
since she was a total stranger—and how could he ac-
cept a stranger’s relationship if he could not accept
his own father’s?

In the course of time Nelson perceived that his re-
jection of his parents was unwarranted. He was able
to recognize that his father was a warm, mild, gra-
cious individual with high moral and ethical stand-
ards. The acceptance of his step-mother did not come
as easily, however, because she was more inconstant
in temperament. Her feelings for Nelson were genu-
ine and strong, so despite his attempts to deny any
positive emotions, he eventually was weaned from his
original animosity toward her. In recognizing the
lack of justification for his behavior toward his par-
ents, Nelson was exposed to deep feelings of remorse
and shame. These feelings were so poignant and pain-
ful, that they were repressed—that is—pushed out
of his conscious mind. This reaction alleviated the
immediate pain of guilt, but subsequently allowed
them to act as motives for irrational and injurious
behavior when he reached adulthood.

The second major tragedy of Nelson’s life occurred
when he was eight years of age. He underwent major
surgery for the excision of a brain abscess. The oper-
ation, though gravely serious, did not necessarily im-
pose any restrictions or limitations on his future de-
velopment. The unhappy results of this operation
acerued because of circumstances within the family
constellation. His parents were naturally concerned
about his physical health after this operation, and
they manifested their anxiety through overconcern
for his welfare and restriction of his activities. They
continually admonished him to ‘‘take it easy’’ and
implored him not to exert himself in any way that
might jeopardize his health. These are difficult in-
structions for almost any child to adhere to, and for
Nelson they proved doubly difficult. Firstly, he was
trying to disprove the feelings of unworthiness which
he initially experienced in regard to himself. Second-
ly, there was a strong rivalry with his older brother
which made it imperative for Nelson to assert himself
whenever possible. Deep conflict was thus induced
and this evoked in Nelson strong feelings of resent-
ment toward his parents. He looked upon their ad-
monitions as attempts at unreasonable restriction
upon his behavior, not realizing that they were mo-
tivated in their actions by their concern for him.
These feelings of resentment tended to reinforce the
unconscious euilt which he was already experiencing.

Eastern Eeho

Nelson’s adolescent development was character-
ized by withdrawal and emotional blunting. That is,
he tended to hold himself aloof from other people,
and sought to approach all phases of life strictly from
the intellectual standpoint. These were attempts to
combat the emotional conflicts which he experienced,
but could neither identify nor overcome.

At the age of twenty, Nelson suffered another seri-
ous reversal. He was apprehended by the police in
a stolen automobile, although circumstances seemed
to indicate that he had no knowledge that the car.was
stolen. He was sentenced to White Hill for this of-
fense and served 14 months. At the time of his arrest,
Nelson was deeply enamoured of a young woman,
and they were making plans for marriage. These
plans were necessarily postponed, and when they
tried to resume their courtship upon his release, her
parents intervened and terminated their relationship
with finality.

The humiliation and rejection he suffered as a
consequence of his incarceration, proved to be more
than Nelson could tolerate. He began to drink
heavily, to allay his guilt feelings, and was soon re-
turned to White Hill as a parole violator. This ad-
ditional term of imprisonment only added further
welght to Nelson’s feelings of worthlessness and
shame. Two subsequent paroles followed the same
pattern, until Nelson reached the age of twenty-six,
which no longer made him subject to the indefinite
sentence which had been imposed upon him.

The past twelve years have brought a succession of
impulsive, useless felonies, and although Nelson pos-
sesses superior intelligence, his crimes have never
been well planned nor carefully executed. It was
almost inevitable that he would be caught, and in
fact, this was one of the strongest motives which im-
pelled him to commit these acts.

The idea of a need for punishment is a hard one for
many people to accept, but when an individual experi-
ences overriding feelings of shame and guilt, it is
only through punishment that these feelings can be
assuaged.

There does not seem to be any need for close seru-
tiny of these last 12 years of Nelson’s life, for we
would find only the results rather than the sources or
causes of his behavior. The forces that were set in
motion during his childhood, and which were subse-
quently reinforced during adolescence and early
adulthood, have been the prepotent factors in shap-
ing his pattern of living.

Those who view crime as essentially a matter of
will power, will probably feel that this is not a typical
or representative case. It is not—nor for that matter
is there any such thing as typical when we deal with
individuals and their unique problems. Every person
presents his own pattern of motives, drives, and de-
fenses. We can never attribute a person’s deviant
acts to one specific event or cireumstance, nor can we
ascribe it to a failure in one diserete area of function-
ing. The criminal act becomes one type of solution—
a poor one indeed, and serves some purpose for the
individual, whether it be the need for power, aggres-
sion, or punishment. These propositions, of course,
dismiss entirely the will-power theory of crime. This
is a viewpoint held by many psychologists. 8
