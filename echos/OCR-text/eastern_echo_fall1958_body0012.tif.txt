A Lawyer’s
Responsibility
To
The Offender

As written for THE TEMPLE LAW QUARTERLY

by WILLIAM J. BANMILLER

As a layman whose career has exposed him
over a period of two decades to all facets of the
subject, my feeling and observations have been con-
ditioned by trial and error, by seeing the ridiculous
and the serious complaints, by listening to offenders
with preposterous claims that even the uninitiated
ean ascertain as fraudulent and frivolous. Con-
versely and more lamentable, are the indigent and
friendless, who might not have fared so badly if
given legal assistance.

Everyone agrees that our Constitution pro-
vides certain safeguards that are more than cliches;
that mean more than euphonious phrases. They were
debated and argued for months and refined over a
period of years by construction. Are we to assume
they can be short circuited on the premise that it is
a cumbersome procedure?

There are two areas of counsellor responsibility
as I see it, that which is strictly legally defined and
that which is morally conceived. It is essential
that the two merge to complete the moral responsi-
bility and relationship between offender and law-
yer. Anything else should not be sanctioned. Any-
thing else negates the very canon of ethics every
lawyer swears to uphold. As I recall, centuries ago
men of law were the elite of the state and fees were
forbidden. Certainly that is not here proposed, but,
surely the indigent should stand on the same plane
as the affluent where life and liberty are involved.

PRE-TRIAL PHASE

I firmly believe an offender who is without
funds should be assigned competent counsel, who

will represent the offender as though a fee were
available. Perhaps Article 6 of our Constitution
has been construed to mean that if a person retains
counsel he must be permitted to “have assistance of
counsel.” Many of our State Courts hold that coun-
sel need not be provided, except in capital cases.

To their everlasting credit, many courts now
assign counsel to those offenders unable to employ
an attorney in non-capital cases. Some years ago
I read an article that aptly states my feeling on need
of counsel. The American Bar Association had re-
peatedly invited attention of the legal profession
to the plight of the defenseless accused. Then a
lengthy report was prepared on what happens to
the poor and ignorant who run afoul of the law.
Some findings were amazing—57% of those charged
with felony are tried without benefit of counsel—
the defendant in the average criminal case has no
legal help until most of the opportunities for build-
ing a defense have passed. It was reported that as
a result 70 to 90% of all accused pleaded guilty.
Because they are guilty? Perhaps. Who knows?
The late Justice Hughes wrote: “There is no more
serious menace than the discontent that is fostered
by the belief that one cannot enforce his legal rights
because of poverty.” I would propose that before
acceptance of any plea in any felony by the indig-
ent or ignorant that council has to be assigned due
to the complexity in some pleas. To say that an
offender with a past criminal experience is legally
competent to cope with the procedure is incorrect,
as even counsels, district attorneys and courts err
on certain fundamental points. It is admitted this
may be onerous at times and thankless at other
