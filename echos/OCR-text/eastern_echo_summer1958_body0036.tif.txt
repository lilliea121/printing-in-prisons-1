BACK STAGE

‘“‘Hiveryone likes to bear a good musician or
singer perform on stage, but only a few care to hear
him practice back stage.’’ So said Robert Johnson,
one of the best trumpet players in this institution.
How true this is! And it is not surprising to find
only a handful who are interested in becoming mu-
sicians ... it calls for patience, drive, determination
and will power. Above all, it calls for hard work
and unending sacrifice.

Going back stage, we see the Charmers working
conscientiously on a number titled, ‘‘That’s What
Your Doing To Me.’’ To the right of the group we
see Eugene Davis on xylophone and Tom Gofer on
guitar. To the left, Alphonso LaRue on alto sax
and Bill Schoommaker on drums. The singing group
itself consists of Beauford (Franky) Consar 1st.
tenor; Louis (Lou) Brown 2nd. tenor; Dillard (Big
Mack) Averette, baritone; Howard (Slim) Strange,
bass; and Jimmy (Foots) Lane their beloved leader.

Hoots is speaking: “Alright George,” (To la-
Rue on sax) ‘‘take that down again.’’ They begin
again—one minute later-—‘‘Hold it George, try it

y)

this way.’’ At this he plucks away at his guitar
and the melody spells itself out with ease. ‘‘Ok
George?’’ LaRue shakes his head yes. (Note: He
refers to all his men as George. )

They start again—nine seconds later—* No, No,
No!!! Look George, let’s try this one.’’ Addressing
the group he says, ‘‘This is the one you have to run
on G-Flat, Ok? ‘‘Gofer takes off with a mean pick
job and the whole group is on his tail with a very
fast back ground to a number titled, ‘‘Oh Run Run
Pretty Baby Doll.’’ This number was started 32
times within the next two hours. But when it was
completed it was a splendid rendition that had cap-
tured. a taste of perfection.

In listening to this quintet, what can be said to
do them justice when even their practice session is
a masterpiece of pure entertainment? You will have
to see and hear their rhythmic coordination for true
appreciation. —

At present the quintet’s pinnacle is only a
dream. However, I find it fostered with an auspi-
cious attitude.

In conelusion let me add a bit of philosophy:
True beauty does not lie in the completion but rather
in the growth. Be it a child growing to manhood,
a man’s quest for love or the hard grind back stage
for a future performance... true beauty lies always
in the growth. S|

An old-timer peered into the front office one
recent Sunday morning, scratched his head and mur-
mured, ‘“‘Who’d have thought it?” The event
eliciting this comment was the recently inaugura-
ted ‘‘Music Appreciation Hour.’’ Some of the men
sat with their eyes closed, some with that unde-
seribable, far away look, but almost without fail,
they were away from here for a little while.

Last summer the institution was the beneficiary
of a gift of an automatic record player from Phil
Sheridan, local radio and television star. A little
while later, one of Philadelphia’s distinguished
judges, Curtis Bok, while on a visit, heard about
Mr. Sheridan’s donation. He magnanimously dona-
ted some wonderful L.P. Classical Records. Several
men approached Mr. William Berg, in charge of
Social Service, about the possibility of having a
Music Appreciation Hour, featuring Classical Music,
Mr. Berg had been instrumental in the presentation
of similar programs at the Federal Institutions at
Lewisburg, Pennsylvania and Danbury, Connecticut,
and he quite willingly took the matter up at the
next meeting of the Superintendent’s Staff Board.
Mr. Banmiller and the Board heartily approved the
idea.

MUSIC IN OUR AIR.

Most of the Sunday morning programs have had
a varied assortment of music. There were of course
curiosity seekers but, for the most part, those who
still attend are loyal and fervent listeners. The
music collection has grown as subsequent gifts have
come in from various quarters. We now have avail-
able more than fifty hours of listening. Among the
composers represented on the records are Beethoven,
Brahms, Bizet, Dvorak, Mahler, Bach, Chopin,
Tschaikovsky, Franck, Handel, and others. Every-
one is welcome to attend and derive from the music
vast melodic pleasures. For some it may be mem-
ories of Robin Hood Dell concert of the past, for
others a wonderful day at the Academy of Musie.
But more important for most, the drifting during
those fleeting moments will not be to a yesterday,
but more to a tomorrow; a brighter and happier
tomorrow, when we will have these great moments
available to us, not for a few hours, but for as often
as we wish—OUTSIDE.

For those interested we have available during
a normal week of listening on our earphones the fol-
lowing: The New York Philharmonic, The Cleve-
land Symphony, The Metropolitan Opera Broadeasts,
Classical Music For Those Who Hate Classical Musie,
and several others. Some day soon we may even
have an F.M. Station on one of our radio channels.

But as the ‘old-timer’ said, ‘‘Who’d ’ave thought
