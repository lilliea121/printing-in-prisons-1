Happiness is Just a Dog Called:

ALWAYS KEEP THEM LAUGHING

After prowling the institution, Snoopy reports
he can’t find a trio more jovial than Lamont, Harry
and 0-9.

Charley Norman confided in our tail-wagger that
his chess game definitely will improve this year.
(Wishful thinking?)

The Beau Brummell of Dogland happened by
Benny the Barber’s shop. There stood Benny gazing
fondly at his new Barber’s license, all the while
eutting his customer’s eyelashes off, (alas, poor eye-
lashes).

Prancing around like the “Cat on a Hot Tin
Roof’, ever alert for stray tacks, Snoopy dropped in
on the newly organized Upholstery Class. There he
spied Earl Brown, who was hammering away while
spitting out tacks and his own brand of dry humor,
to the delight of all within hearing.

SEARCH OFF—SPOTLIGHT ON

Taking a breather from his hectic search for the
stray tom-cat that played such havoe with our strict-
ly female feline population, and who left behind a
multitude of tiny mewling mementos, Snoopy sat a
spell and became deeply engrossed with the attitude
of one of our senior inmates, Joe Buzzard. Joe is in
the autumn of his days, but he gets friskier with the
passing of time. Spouting vitriolic advice to the
footballers, he’s always ready to defend his right
to root for whom he chooses, and how he elects to

In a quieter tone, Joe drew a word picture of
Mr. Thomas H. Graham, Athletic Director, for giv-

out for the Varsity Softball Team. Mr. Graham/’s
huneh paid off with “Old Joe” romping like a
schoolboy at first base, as well as turning into one
of the team’s leading hitters. A tip of the paw to
Eastern’s own “Satch Page”.

HOME ON THE RANGE

While in the Craft Shop, Snoopy gave out with
a howl of animated pleasure while watching Knobby
Richter, whose entire tonnage was straddling a
hobby-horse designed for a toddler. Trying in vain
to assume a look other than one of sheer joy, he
kept rockin’ away like Marshal Mat Dillon. His
story was: “I just want to see how strong it is!”
If what he said was true, why did he keep saying,
“Giddee Up, Giddee Up’?

SAVED BY THE BELT

While in the vicinity of Seven Block, our snoop-
ing canine’s ears detected a startled gasp emitted by
Charlie Mooney. It seems Charlie’s lawyers, in a
recent letter, had mentioned something about more
money, with the resulting gasp causing his belt to
snap in half. No casualties however, since it wasn’t
his money-belt and everything held up.

Brother Larry, who was standing by with check-
