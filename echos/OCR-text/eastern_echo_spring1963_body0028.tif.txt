UTOPIA

Where do the answers to these multiple problems
lie—problems created as a result of the actions of
we social offenders? Some prisoners will no doubt
respond with the frequently used, ‘“They (uncaught
society) must understand us’; or, “They must be
educated.’ This is true. But we members of this
separate ‘“‘set-aside’’ society, also realize that we

(Con't from Page 10)

must learn to understand ourselves, and be willing
to recognize our own problems. We know that
punishment, deprivation, and human suffering is not
rehabilitation; and since free society has wisely ac-
cepted the idea that rehabilitation is the aim, then
it is up to that society to insure the availability of
adequate funds, for the proper facilities and treat-
ment. Treatment that will enhance our recognition
of the very things that caused us to operate as we
did—contrary to the “‘other’’ society from which we
have been excluded. For it has been proven that in
the treatment of any problem—mental, physical,
emotional (whatever)——the cause must be estab-
lished before any cure can be effected. The solution
is not simply for the offender to give up and say, “If
you can’t fight "em, join ’em,” for this is mere ac-
quiesence, and even though he may be sincerely re-
pentant at the moment, even we offenders are ready
to admit that this is not good insurance against re-
cidivism, whereas true rehabilitation IS. It is a mat-
ter of knowing we belong to a system that calls for
this higher animal to function as a higher animal
should, as opposed to the living habits of the lower
species of animal life, in which we have been classed.

There are numerous methods to be employed,
even now, so that we can overcome our present,
seemingly stationary status. Some of these methods
might be found within our own thought processes.
They are available to us through what the psycholo-
gists call, “‘introspection.’’ Some are available in the
form of helps, such as spiritual counseling and psy-
chotherapy. But the most important consideration
can be stated in the form of a question: Are pris-
oners, as members of the human animal species, will-
ing to make certain necessary adjustments through
understanding in order to conform to the expecta-
tions of our former and, quite possibly, our future
society >?

Prisoners must be encouraged to be flexible, and
still maintain most of their individual principles.
They must learn how to be comfortable and satisfied
without causing others of the species discomfort, and
even misery. We prisoners must be given the oppor-
tunity to understand how to look upon ourselves in
the same manner that the majority of our former so-

26

ciety looks upon us. If these problems are approach-
ed in a positive manner, and with honest-to-goodness
effort, prisoners may then find open to them new
vistas of great understanding, of not only their own
problems and the nature thereof, but the problems
which our former society must cope with may then
be viewed more objectively.

Thus the process continues. I believe eventually
an evolutionary change will take place within each
person afflicted with this present environment, and
all around us the members of our species in their
varied societies will begin to look differently to us,
even though this evolution seems to occur, Oh, so

Profile

partments, Washington, D.C. This research was per-
formed here at Eastern State Correctional Institu-
tion in August of 1960. The letter reads:

To Whom it May Concern:

Mr. Walter Gala, an inmate at Eastern State
Penitentiary, was associated with our group in
evaluating treatment of major and minor burns.

(Cont from Page 11)

I can say the men were completely depend-
able, extremely cooperative and pleasant to
work with. Their job was long and arduous.
and required working at unnecessary periods
of the day.

] have nothing but the highest regards for
him.

Sincerely yours,
Irvin H. Sokolic, M.D.
Adjunct, Dept. of Surgery

Walter's everyday job here is the highly skilled
job of sterilization of all surgical instruments and
operating room supplies. He is an important mem-
ber of the operating room team, and assists in Or-
thopedic, Ophthalmology, and Plastic Surgery cases,
in addition to his general nursing duties on ear, nose
and throat treatments, plus his services in the emer-
gency clinic. He is also the recipient of a diploma

for Civil Defense First Aid.

This is Walter Gala, inmate E-1239.

We will avoid the trite phrases, the dull platitudes
and the pragmatic sentences, as well as the oft ma-
ligned “‘Rehabilitated.”’ The facts speak for them-
selves. Walt is ready, willing, and very able to justi-

fy his request for acceptance .. . . anywhere.
