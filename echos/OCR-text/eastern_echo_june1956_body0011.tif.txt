was having trouble finding a suitable parking place.
This caused them to slow down their pace until
Butch next appeared on the sidewalk and pulled out
his handkerchief—the all’s clear signal. The boys
quickened their pace and soon passed Butch, who ap-
peared oblivious of their presence. They came to
the walk leading into the bank which set back some
thirty feet from the sidewalk, and slowly turned into
the passageway.

Little Mickey scurried across the street, both
hands tugging at the meandering pillow slip. He
reached the sidewalk and trotted over to walk im-
mediately behind Red. They were still in single
file as they reached the first step leading up into the
bank when Porkey slowed down his gait causing Red
to step on his heels. Little Micky, his head down as
he stared at the bulge in his waistband, collided with
Red, who in turn, bumped into Porkey. All three
fell sprawling and floundering as they tried to main-
tain their balance.

None of them saw the gun muzzle pointing at
them from the corner of the bank building nor the
two guns covering them from the parked cars in the
adjoining parking lot. The ensuing battle was of
short duration but decisive and in a moment the boys
lay still on the cold stone steps gasping out their

last breath. Crime had not paid for the boys—at
least not this afternoon.

From the rear of the parked cars two cops
emerged and carefully approached, their guns held
close to their hips ready to go into instant action.
Not so, however, with the intrepid junior G-man who
brandished his imitation Tommy-gun and shrieked
with derision, ‘‘We got them! We won! It’s our
turn to be the robbers tomorrow.’’

The robbers sheepishly untangled themselves
and sat erect on the bottom steps of the bank. Lit-
tle Micky now had his jacket unzippered and had
thrust his hand beneath his shirt where a crimson
stain slowly spread.

‘‘Hey, Micky,’’ Red eried in alarm, ‘‘you’re
really wounded.”’

Micky slowly shifted his gaze from the crimson
stain on his shirtfront to the cops and robbers, then
with uneffected wide - eyed innocence explained,
‘‘Naw, I’m not wounded. This red stuff is coming
from a raspberry tart my mom made me for my
birthday tomorrow ’cause I’m six years old.’’ He
drew out the squashed tart and on looking at it
with a mournful expression concluded, ‘‘Porkey
said we were going to play Cowboys and Indians to-
day and I was going to put the red stuff on my face
like a real Indian—and eat the rest.’’

day is to de-emphasize the ‘penal’ and to lay

more stress on correction and rehabilitation.
Rather than concentrate entirely on punishing their
inmates, penologists are becoming aware that a cor-
rectional program incorporated into their institu-
tions would result in the releasing of inmates
suitable adjusted to become citizens, rather than
pariahs of society.

A study has shown that a very large percentage
of inmates have an unstable, erratic work record
with no specific training or special skills. This in-
stability in part may be caused by their disinterest
in their work compounded by the less attractive pay
envelope. Many left school and rushed into the
first job that was offered them, never questioning
the potentialities of the job: whether it offered
training that would eventually lead to a better po-
sition and raise their standards, or even if they were
suited for that particular job. Too many left school
with very little education and were handicapped in
competing for the more lucrative jobs. The result
being that their dissatisfaction led them on the eter-
nal quest for a ‘better job’.

For those who have no particular training or
specific skills it is reeommended that they take ad-

vantage of the time on their hands and try to learn
a trade that would hold their interest and return a
substantial pay when once again they are released
to society and their families. To compete, it is not
enough to learn or gain a working knowledge of
your trade. You must become thoroughly familiar
with your work to the extent that it becomes a part
of your life, so attractive in its own way that you
look forward each morning with anticipation as you
approach your workshop or plant. Work is not a
drudgery unless you will it to be so. Create an in-
terest in your work and what has been drudgery at
once becomes a pleasant task. But effort must be
applied to the task. Don’t just use your present
job as a bridge to span time from ‘portal to portal’.

Granted that the vocational training as outlined
for this institution is still in its infancy, there is a
sufficient and varied amount of trades available to
those interested. Your Vocational Director, Mr.
Fred Banks, is ready and willing at all times to
counsel and advise you. He can point you in the
right direction but you must tread the way your-
self. No advice or counsel is worth the effort to
utter them unless the recipient possesses the forti-
tude and determination to take advantage and
follow through.
