head. of his class.

minated his experiences as a Zine Miner, Iron-
Worker, Railroad Man, Chemist and Musician, into
his expression of life in vivid color. If anyone were
to ask me his method of teaching—his technique—
I would be at a loss for an answer. He is more than
a teacher. George, as we all call him, is a friend.
He is interested in us as individuals, who share his
love of Art. I don’t believe that George ever thinks
of us as ‘‘Inmates.’’ He illustrates by utilizing the
medium of Colored Photography, as well as personal
demonstration. He exhibits enthusiasm over your
futile attempts, and makes you feel that your work
is important. He instills pride of accomplishment,
while constructively criticizing. The scenes of the
countryside, that were commonplace to us in our
past, acquire new values when seen through the eyes
of this man of verve. George teaches Art. But,
George gives us much more. The stereotype word
‘‘Rehabilitation,’’ does not apply to the class of Art.
Rehabilitation infers a return to a certain status.
The class of Art is assimilating a sense of ‘“‘Reevalua-
tion.’’ To the men who study Art, the world becomes
a brighter, more joyous place in which to live. They
receive an improved sense of values. To almost
every Inmate in Prison, a Hobby is essential. As he
pursues his Hobby, he can dream of the better life
he has experienced or, the one he hopes for in the fu-
ture. What better Hobby could be found than to
put these hopes and dreams on Canvas, in the ex-
pression of color. They remain as permanent rec-
ords of hope, beauty and the turmoils within the
individual.

The members of the Art Class look forward,
eagerly, to the weekly sessions with our friend. ‘The
companionable ventures into colorful expression
shall be fond memories of an otherwise somber ex-
istence. Diplomas on Sheepskin are not given to the
students of the class as awards of accomplishment.
However, Diplomas on Canvas shall, no doubt, grace

the walls in their homes throughout the years to
come. Very few of us, if any, shall pursue Art as a
means of making a living. It is a rough road to the
land of plenty. And yet, in some measure, living
shall become an Art to those who have benefited by
its teaching.

We owe much to the many who have made this
class possible. They have brought a ray of sunshine
into our world of monotony, drabness and ignominy.
We wish to thank them all, for the contributions
made toward emotional release and personal ac-
complishment. Thanks are offered to ‘‘Jim Beatty,
an Artist in his own right, who assists Mr. Redling
greatly, in his work. ‘‘Jim’’ works incessantly for
the good of the Class. He handles all of the detail,
so necessary for a study group. Materials, appoint-
ments, assistance in the many projects, and unflag-
ging enthusiasm come under his willing hand. All of
this, plus having an Art Class of his own. Further,
he supplies the Art Work needed for this institution.
Quite a project for the little man, but he does it so
well. He is not forgotten in his efforts. There are
others who contribute effort for the good of the Class
as a whole. It is that type of a group. Hach one
working for the good of all. It is also, indicative
of the caliber of the teacher. It reflects good fellow-
ship and deep interest. J am proud to be a member
of such a group, and thankful for the opportunity to
display this pride publicly.

Due to outside commitments, (An Artist must
eat, also) Mr. Redling has abandoned the Saturday

-afternoon Class in favor of Wednesday afternoon.

It would certainly be a welcome sight, if the Wednes-
day afternoon class were to be filled to the point of
overflowing. The facilities are available. Mr. Red-
ling will be available. All that is needed is the
desire of our fellow Inmates to venture into the
World of Art. Once the venture is inaugerated,
it becomes an adventure. An adventure on an unend-
ing trail, through the realm of natures beauty. =e)
