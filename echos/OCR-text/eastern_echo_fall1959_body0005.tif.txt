THE ECHO MAIL BAG

This space is usually reserved for nu-
merous letters received from Our Readers
—some approving, some disapproving. For
this issue we are utilizing it to relate to
you the series of events which occurred
as a result of a citizen’s interest in a
pressing problem.

On June 25, 1959, John J. McDermott,
of 9411 Torresdale Avenue, Phila, Pa.,
in a letter to the Editor of the MAYFAIR
TIMES, made the following suggestion in
relation to publicized conditions existing
at the Byberry State Hospital:

‘‘Being a subscriber to ECHO magazine
(issued by the inmates of Eastern Pen),
I get a glimpse of the qualities of the
men and women serving time in our penal
institutions. I feel sure enough good in-
mates, possibly serving their last years,
could be organized into a colony of me-
chanics and attendants who would be
happy and willing to serve out their time
with limited liberty and regular guard se-
curity at the Byberry institution.’’

Mr. McDermott forwarded a copy of the
Editorial Page, upon which his letter ap-
peared, to then Editor of the Hastern
Echo, Joseph J. Cuff. Cuff’s reply con-
tained the following statement:

“‘Your letter is the first to offer such
a solution to a vital problem. It is the
only letter we have ever come across
that was written with such insight, and
most of all, be a step forward in modern
penology. Do you realize the rehabilitative
value of such a program? We too often
hear political promises to create a true
rehabilitative program, but in due time
these promises become lost in the shuffle.
Let us hope that your letter is brought to
the attention of those higher-ups that
could do something concrete in such a
program.’?

As a result of this reply, in which
Editor Cuff cited the need for someone to
start the ball rolling, Reader McDermott
sent the reply and the TIMES items
to Governor David L. Lawrence.

Mr. McDermott received the following
reply from the Governor’s office:

“‘Dear Mr. McDermott:

The Governor has received your inter-
esting letter concerning the possibility of
using prisoners as employees at Byberry
State Hospital, together with aeccompany-
ing material, and has requested me to
reply to it. As you may know, we now
have a committee of prominent and in-
terested personnel who are concerned with
the management of Byberry and are ex-
ploring ways for improving conditions
there.

i have taken the liberty of turning
your suggestions over to this committee
and discussing them with the Commission-
er of Mental Health. I am sure that they
will take it under advisement and give
it proper consideration.

Thank you for your interest in this
subject, and your trouble in contacting
ussiae

Budget Secretary

This is the present status of action
taken at press time. We hope for more
favorable action to be forthcoming in
this matter.

From the Superintendent's Desk:

In my opinion one of the most important
phases of the Judicial function is to determine
everything possible about a defendant before
imposing sentence after determination of guilt
by plea or verdict. This should be accomplished
by a seldom followed practice in the Common-
wealth known as Pre-sentence Investigation.

Most counties do not appropriate sufficient
funds for this and the few that do have too few
trained men to present adequate facts to the
Court for guidance.

Much has been written and proposed but little has been done by
the counties to establish this important arm to assist the Court in proper
sentencing either to a probationary period or a prison sentence in keep-
ing with the background a trained probation officer can present. Too
often facts could be presented to the Court in such Pre-sentence reports
that would indicate to the Court that probation instead of a prison
sentence could accomplish the desired result, by restoring a deserving
defendant to his family, resume employment to support the family and
not attach to him the stigma of imprisonment. Regrettably there are
insufficient probation officers to adequately enlarge this field!

There are occasions too where such pre-sentence investigation
would show that a defendant’s mental background warrants judicial
action appropriate for the defendant. Too often men are sent to prison
and shortly after reception a petition must be made to the Court for
transfer to a mental institution—a condition which could have been
properly developed in a pre-sentence report.

William J. Banmiller

Many facts could be uncovered that would apprise the Court that
a more moderate sentence could be imposed so a defendant could have
—yes, even in prison, the educational advantages that were denied
him due to lack of parental guidance or possibly due to economic
reasons, and proper facilities and motivation. So few people realize
the background of a defendant and are quite eager to condemn without
knowing the real facts. Unfortunately, the press paints a defendant
in such a manner that not even he would recognize himself.

Objective, professional pre-sentence reports could reveal complete
background of a defendant from school, neighbors, employers and all
facets of his life which unfortunately in too many eases is not before
the Court.

The Federal Courts have gone far in this field and the State Courts
could well emulate them particularly in large counties where defend-
tragically the young ones—are unknown. I would stronely urge
serious consideration by all counties for the establishment of properly
trained staffs to prepare pre-sentence reports for judicial guidance.
There is ttle doubt that the Courts would weleome pre-sentence inves-
tigation by trained workers.

Another aspect of adequate reports is proper sentencing if pro-
bation is not ordered. This will be covered in the next issue.

Superintendent

The Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia is one of the two great
historic prisons of the world, the cther being at Auburn, New York. The latter
has been completely rebuilt while Eastern remains almost intact except for
additional cell-blocks having been added.

The original structure cost $775,000.

The site had been a cherry orchard on a slight elevation from which it
derives the often used name—Cherry Hill.
