On July 27, 1966, we had the privilege of inter-
viewing two members of the Parolee Committee of
the Junior Chamber of Commerce of Philadelphia.

Parole Counselor Wendell Bristol arranged the
conference, which took place in the ECHO office with
Richard L. Behr, Chairman of the Parolee Commit-
tee; Stuart Harting, Publicity Chairman of the
Committee and the editor and associate editor of
THE EASTERN ECHO.

Both Jaycee members are businessmen in the
Philadelphia area. Behr is a financial analyst with
the Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company and holds
a bachelor of arts degree from Trinity College. Hart-
ing is a real estate representative with Albert M.
Greenfield and Company, Incorporated. He holds a
bachelor of science degree from Temple University.

The men explained that the Junior Chamber of
Commerce is a service organization established al-
most thirty years ago with various forms of com-
munity service as its goal. Their parolee sponsor-
ship program is only one phase of their multiple-
community service program. The Parolee Commit-
tee consists of twenty-five members to serve from the
main membership body. Members of the Commitee
represent a wide variety of professional back-
grounds, including attorneys, stock brokers, insur-
ance executives, real estate executives and other

types of business and professional occupations.

The Jaycee Parolee Committee was organized in
1948 and was very active until 1961, at which time,
for various reasons, it became inactive. The program
was reactivated in 1964 and two parolees are pres-
ently being sponsored from this institution with 17
from other area prisons.

Having been organized with the intention of as-
sisting former prisoners to readjust and face the
realities of society, the Committee members have re-
ceived in the past year, 43 requests for full or partial
parole plans, in addition to the current 19 active
plans. They have rejected, to date, only nine.

Messers Behr and Harting said that none of the
men they have undertaken to assist, have been re-
turned to prison for new convictions or for technical
violations of parole; which, of course, speaks highly
of the type and extent of help they have been giving.
It seems to verify that the Parolee Committee is
seriously interested in assisting former prisoners.

When asked if they will sponsor repeaters, previ-
ously sponsored by their group, Behr replied: “We
have not been faced with this problem yet, but we
would certainly consider such requests after evalu-
ating the individual circumstances.”

Mr. Harting explained that when they consider an
initial application, the Committee uses the following
