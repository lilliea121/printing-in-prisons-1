HISTORY OF THE EASTERN ECHO CONT’D

Echo magazine like many of its prison counter-
parts suffers publication problems similar to many
of society’s periodicals. It has been published on a
quarterly basis since its first publication date of
March, 1956. Considering that a great number of the
Penal Press magazines run bi-monthly, and monthly
(12 issues a year), it seems strange that this institu-
tion only prints its magazine four times a year. Echo’s
publication problems become apparent when it is
pointed out that when a prison magazine such as
ours is geared toward printing articles that are more
than a statistical outline of printing prison happen-
ings, then our problems become more complex. The
writers consume more time in articles presented by
gathering factual data through research; and the co-
ordination of this data into article or story form. The
need to be accurate becomes more acute especially
when you are submitting material that deals with
real facts and events in society. Also the manuscripts
submitted are read by the inmate staff for their ap-
proval and then submitted to an official staff for their
comments and approval (See Summer Issue - 1966
Editorial). The actual printing of this magazine is
a prime factor also, as our printing plant is set up
as part of an industry printing for state owned and
state aided agencies in the State of Pennsylvania.
Henee, the Hastern Echo’s printing must be handled
as part of a ‘‘customer manufacturing need’’ like
any other business order. It is this vocational inte-
eration that lends itself to teaching printing skills
and encountering problems comparable to what the
man will face in the productive ‘‘outside society.’’

Another aspect of the Eastern Echo’s creed is to
present the best type of objective writing possible.
A sad but true fact is the minimizing of a man’s past
wrongs against society by so many of the Penal Press
magazines in vogue today. A prime example is the
many instances cited in which the convict is depicted
‘‘stealing apples,’’ ‘‘jaywalking,’’ and the like, in
order to prove a point in favor of the argument pre-
sented. The majority of the Hastern Echo’s staff
through the years have endeavored to eliminate this
type of sloppy sentimentality. It has not, of course,
been always successful. The unnatural subjectiveness
that is inherent in most of us, due to our environment,
is a contributing factor to this kind of emotionalism.

The Eastern Echo has made it a policy to strike
a balance in considering the man as he has proved
himself, regardless of the wrong of yesteryear. Thus,
you will find the words ‘‘ Rehabilitation or Revenge’’
quoted in so many of the articles printed in this
magazine.

The aims of the Kastern Echo are woven into
the words, ‘‘Be broad and progressive in your out-
look.’’ To do this, the magazine must keep striving
for improvement. The best way is to present all
writings in an intelligent manner. To be ready to
face refutation with the courage of conviction, ‘‘dis-
agreeably agreeable.’’ To ever keep in mind that this
magazine is not one man’s sole property, but a con-
structive instrument of creativity for all the prisons’
inhabitants. It is interlocked in the words of your
author who stressed the fact of ‘‘helping the man to
help himself through the medium of writing.’’

MY ANNIVERSARY

In the ten years I have had the privilege of being
associated with the Echo staff, I have observed the
progress of many men who have worked in various
capacities in the preparation of our Institutional
Publication.

The person who writes an article must be versed
in english and all its ramifications. The type-setter
must have the proper mechanical training and expe-
rience. The operator of the proof press as well as
the proof-reader cannot be excused for errors. Print-
ing the article for publication becomes the responsi-
bility of the pressmen. He must not only have a
knowledge of the mechanics of his press, but also
the appearance and readability of the insertion fall
heavily upon his shoulders. Binding the magazine
must be done with precision and good judgement.
Finally, the shipper must be trained to know how to
prepare the copies for distribution within the institu-
tion and for outside delivery.

With proper application and with satisfactory
achievement in any one of these departments a man
ean qualify for placement in the printing industry. I
have had the experience of seeing men become experts
in all of these processes, from beginning to end. These

trainees are in demand and can be placed in the bet-
ter Jobs with golden opportunities for advancement.

ECHO’S 10th ANNIVERSARY

The Echo serves a threefold purpose. Mainly it
is a media for transmission of ideas and thoughts
both educational and controversial. Secondly it brid-
ges a gap all to frequently overlooked or minimized—
that of our outside population having none or very
little concept of the action and activities going on
in a correctional institution.

Lastly, from the individual outlook with regard
to ones livelihood, is the training aspect whether it
be as a Skilled craftsman or a fledgling reporter or
writer, as an instrument toward self expression and
technique of presentation.

In conelusion such a publication is most impor-
tant since constant communication can promote better
understanding and human relations.
