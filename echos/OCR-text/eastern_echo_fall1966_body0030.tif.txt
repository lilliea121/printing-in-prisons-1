APPOINTMENT CONFIRMED FOR DIRECTOR OF TREATMENT

It takes skill to separate fact from fiction in the
fanciful yarns flowing constantly through the inter-
nal grapevine. One of the wildest and most wishful
stories to come through in recent times predicted the
appointment of Mr. Joseph Maher, 7-Gallery ‘‘head
shrinker’’ (as he and his colleagues were referred
to hereabouts) to the position of Director of Treat-
ment eons (and this is important to note) before
there was even a suggestion that the DOT position
was going to become vacant.

When the Director of Treatment vacancy actually
occured those of us who had picked up the Maher
appointment when it first appeared on the ‘‘wire
service’’ simply waited for ‘‘the day to follow the
night’’ so to speak.

The man, Joseph Maher, age 382, psychologist,
was officially appointed to the job, Director of Treat-
ment, September 1, 1966, after serving as ‘‘house”’
psychologist since August 1962 (also the date he
commenced working at SCIPHA).

Education: attended LaSalle College and did
undergraduate work in psychology; also did graduate
work and clinical training in psychology at Temple
University; took corollary courses in foreign lan-
guages and methods of teaching same—specializing
in German. Note: Mr. Maher plans to continue
studies toward a degree in criminology or corrections.

Experience: worked in casework department of
Philadelphia County, Department of Public Assist-
ance - 14 years; counselor and administrator of clinics
treating alcoholics in a local General Hospital and
suburban private hospital - 4 years; worked as a
psychologist at SCIPHA - 4 years.

at the guitar.’’? He has four years military service
in the U. 8. Coast Guard, was honorably discharged
and had obtained the rate of hospital corpsman
1/class at time of separation.

Mr. Maher is a member of the following orga-
nizations: West Mt. Airy Neighbors Association,

Concert
Band
Commended

It has seldom been the pleasure of the reviewer
to experience as enjoyable a program as the one
offered by the institution band on November 15, 1966.

This ensemble under the able direction of its
leader, Robert Barclay, Music Director, produced, in
this writer’s opinion, a tonal quality and beauty of
sound not often heard at a concert in an institution
setting.

To begin with, the band performed as a unit.
There were no noticeably missed cues; the various
sections came in precisely; and the coda executed as
required. Whatever flaws appeared, can be attributed
more to imperfect acoustics and amplification than to
faulty playing or poor musicianship.

Probably more outstanding than the instrumental
and vocal versatility displayed was the range and un-
usualness of the program itself. Mr. Barclay dared
to tackle musical works more adaptable for symphonic
groups and carried them successfully. The writer
must admit that he was apprehensive because of the
nature of the program selections and the limitations
imposed by the available instrumentation, but his
fears soon proved to be unfounded once the band
demonstrated its sure-fire proficiency.

The concert was a stunning success and proved
once again that spirit, determination, and skill will
overcome a dearth of instruments and personnel.
