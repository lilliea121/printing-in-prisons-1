An honor system without custodial supervision ts ef fective.

Among the states giving it a trial in the last two years,
are:

CALIFORNIA: Folsom Prison, Represa, California.
Governor Edmond G. Brown recently gave his ap-
proval on a Senate bill which authorizes the Director
of Corrections to remove inmates from prison for the
purpose of arranging a parole placement program.

“WISCONSIN: In 1962, the State of Wisconsin re-

leased 2,281 prisoners to participate in the work
release program. These prisoners earned $633,800.

OREGON: The State of Oregon has had a successful

work release program for the last two years.

PENNSYLVANIA: Known as ‘Prison Outmates”’ in
Lancaster and Allegheny Counties, a limited pilot
program has been in operation since 196]. It has
155 prisoners sentenced for nonsupport leaving pris-
ons daily to hold outside jobs without incident. Re-
peat, without incident!

WASHINGTON D.C.: A work release program for
inmates serving sentences on misdemeanor convic-
tions is taking shape. The District Commissioners
have ordered a bill drafted for submission to Con-
gress. The plan would permit selected prisoners to
leave the institution to work on outside jobs.

INDIANA: In view of the success of allowing inmates
in Indiana to attend outside A.A. meetings from the
Michigan City Prison, Warden John W. Back, of the
Indiana Reformatory, recently allowed two inmates
from his institution to attend outside meetings. In-
mate trips outside the reformatory are extremely
practical and beneficial.

Thirteen inmates recently left the institution to tour
two computer installations in Indianapolis. This trip
was made with no trouble or security problems and
resulted in benefits for the inmates, personnel of the
computer installations and the institutional officials.

The inmates, students of the Reformatory’s data
processing Training Program, were able to see actual
operations of the equipment they were studying. Per-
sonnel of the computer installations saw that all in-
mates were not the monsters depicted by some
newspapers.

Institutional officials received favorable publicity
for allowing the trip. An important thing that the
officials learned, was that an honor system without
custodial supervision is effective, and that the inmates
can be trusted if given a chance to retain their self-
respect and their human dignity.

A WALL OF APATHY:

Society has become too preoccupied with the de-
fects of the offender and the problem he presents;
and too little interested in his potential for social
development.

The public all to often becomes indifferent to the
convicted offender once the walls of prison have
engulfed him. Little or no thought is given to the fact
that at least ninety-five per cent of all convicted of-
fenders will be returned to the free world. Society
must look to the lack of quality in its vocational pro-
grams within the penal institutions as being responsi-
ble for the high rate of recidivism. It is obvious that
most repeaters return to prison because of inadequate
vocational ability. Ironically, this is usually the rea-
son that they came to prison in the first place. The

ultimate goal of all institutional treatment is the re-
lease of men, better adjusted to the demands of life
in free society.

I feel that work release could be valuable tool in
reaching that goal. Work release is not meant as a
panacea. There is no one shot cure-all to recidivism.
Each case presents a different set of causes and ef-
fects. Some of the other tools that could be used
successfully in the future are guidance, understanding,
and education.

Let us put a stop to this senseless waste of produc-
tive manpower. Let us put our offenders to work to
support themselves and their families. Their wages
will help support the state and the Federal govern-
ments through the taxes which they will pay. If
parole is designed as a bridge between prison and
society, then imprisonment, with its associate non-
gainful employment, is most certainly widening the
gap between society and the deviant. Why not an
inmate work program?

There is another factor to be considered. The out-
mate, or Work Release Program, could be made to
work for perhaps thirty to thirty-five per cent of our
prisoners. The sixty or seventy percent remaining still
have the same problem of lack of adequate gainful
employment. Not only does this remaining percent-
age lack gainful employment, they are without the
means to acquire the necessary knowledge and man-
ual skills to compete with the highly technical labor
force of the present times. Antiquated and outmoded
facilities in most prisons today teach skills which are
difficult, if not impossible, to work at upon release. It
