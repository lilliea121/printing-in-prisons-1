had dueled through six scoreless innings, Morton
allowed a single by Shep who stole second, went to
third on a wild pitch, and scored the initial run of
the game when the throw to the plate evaded the
catcher’s glove. In the home half of the seventh
inning, Lucky, the Falcon speed merchant, led off
and hit a fly ball to the conerete walkway in center-
field. Bull lost the ball while Lucky streaked to
third, and when the ball got through Shep on the
throw-in, Lucky pranced home with the tying run.
Tailgate then lashed a sharp single to left. With
Billy Hallowell at bat, Tailgate stole second and
when the ball was thrown into right-centerfield, he
poured on the speed and crossed the plate with the
winning counter. What a game! What a finish!”

The victors in this, the game of the year: The
Falcons by a 2—1 score.

Morton was the winning hurler, with Kalvitis
the loser.

VISITING BAMBI A.C. BLANKS STARS

On Saturday afternoon, May 16, our Cuban
League All-Star team hosted the Bambi A. C. from
4th and Shunk Sts., here in Phila. In a beautifully
played ball game, Rogers dueled with Jordan as the
opposing pitchers. Kalvitis replaced Jordan in the
fourth and suffered the loss. Big Dave Wilder fin-
ished up for the localites. For the visitors, Rogers
fanned seventeen Stars enroute to a no-hit, no-run,
1—O whitewash.

For the record, pitcher Rogers was an All-State
pitcher for the State of Virginia in 1952. Rogers is
a Marine on active duty, being stationed in Phila-
delphia. Naturally, he hurls victoriously for the
Marine team. Our hats off to a wonderful pitcher
who pitched a whale of a ball game.

CAMDEN STARS DOWN CUBAN LEAGUE

On June 27, 1959, our Cuban League All-Stars
met Loper and his Camden All-Stars through the

EASTERN ECHO

auspices of Mr. Berry, of the South Phila. Colts, who
visited us last year with his basketball ensemble.
It was a wild, screaming affair with “Jabbo” Wyatt
opposing “Runt” Jordan on the mound. Loper, the
manager, working from behind the plate, handled
his pitcher well. They gave us a very enjoyable
game, with the smilin’ Jabbo coming through to de-
feat Jordan and the Loealites by a 42 score.

DOWNTOWN A.C. STUNS STARS, 9—1

A gala evening was planned by Mr. Thomas H.
Graham, Director of Athleties and Educational Di-
rector here at E.S.P. It was highlighted by the first
twilight ball game here in Cherry Hill, against out-
side competition, when the Downtown A. C. met our
Cuban League Stars. Accompanying Jim Gilmore
and his team was Mr. Joe Rosstein, Softball Com-
missioner. Game time found Harp opposing Tennes-
see on the mound with the Downtown elub busting
loose on Tennessee for five runs in the first inning
before Big Dave Wilder came to the reseue. Johnny
Hughes, in relief of Harp, gave a brilliant perform-
ance on the mound, his motion being the most de-
ceptive ever witnessed here. The Downtown A. C.
coasted to an easy 9—1 victory.

Storehouse League

The First Half was filled with excitement galore
as a three-team race went right to the wire before
DuPree’s Lynx emerged victorious.

The Phillies amazed everyone with their ability
to fight back. They were instrumental in deciding
the winner of the first half by breaking up the
tightest race ever to be witnessed in this league.
What will happen in the second half remains to be
seen, but your reporter deems the Phillies’ feat to
be worth mention, since they were the doormat for
the rest of the league. This proves that all Cham-
pions don’t win championships. Our hats are doffed
to Little Mac who had this prediction to make at
the start of the season: “Many of the teams in the
league will be singing the blues, and they are!”

Deae Brown became manager of the Phillies
and pulled the trade of the year in acquiring Mike-
tish, Rusty and several additional players with
whom he fashioned a well-balanced team. When
Deac resigned, Miketish took over the reins as mana-
oer.

The Cardinals and Rockets ended the First Half
in a deadlock for second place honors. In a three-
game playoff, the Cardinals won out after a head-on
battle with the fired up Rockets.

At this writing the Storehouse League weleomes
their new commissioner in the person of David Crox-
ton. We are proud to have him with us, because
baseball is his business. The Owners and Managers
of the other teams in the league congratulate the
