Speech... A Blessing

One of the greatest blessings that God has be-
stowed upon man is the power of speech. By it,
man can communicate with his fellowman and ex-
press his sentiments in an external manner. Tihis
instrument of communication can be used for good
or for evil, to up-lift or degrade. How one uses this
gift of God is entirely up to each individual.

The language of a person reflects one’s thoughts
and gives an insight to the character of a man. A
fellow who uses vulgar and abusive language does
so to cover up his lack of fortitude, in other words,
he doesn’t have any ‘‘guts’’. A former champion
sized up an opponent as ‘‘yellow’’ because of his
vile speech. His prediction was correct—his op-
ponent took a dive after a few solid punches. Ob-
serve some of the loud mouths around the institution
—if it came to a show down they wouldn’t be so
tough. They take unfair advantage of a situation
and show no respect for themselves or others.

Conversation can be a means of up lifting or
depressing one’s spirits. The jovial character who
looks at the bright side of things despite his own
troubles, can always enliven a bull session with his
cheerful remarks. More of this type are in demand,
especially on the blue days. Unfortunately, there is
the ever present pessimist, who is constantly erying
the blues, who worms himself into a group. This

specimen of gloom derives morbid pleasure from see-
ing others suffer and his absence would be ap-
preciated.

Our speech should abound with charity. If
something good cannot be spoken about a person
then nothing should be said. Beware of the scandal
monger and the gossiper. Any thing that harms
the reputation of another, even the truth, should
never be revealed. ‘‘Condemn not and you shall not
be condemned.’’ (Luke VI-37) Let’s not even dis-
cuss those who create stories and circulate lies about
another.

The faculty of speech is yours to enjoy or abuse.
In an institution where small talk prevails and every
one knows the other’s business it is extremely im-
portant to guard the tongue. Holy Scripture com-
pares the tongue to a sharp knife—it can be used
for our benefit or destruction. We ought to be as
cautions in our use of the tongue as the surgeon in
the use of his knife. Bear in mind the words of
Our Lord: ‘‘The good man from his good treasure
brings forth good things; and the evil man from
his evil treasure brings forth evil things. But I tell
you, that of every idle word men speak, they shall
give account on the day of judgment. For by thy
words thou wilt be justified, and by thy words thou
wilt be condemned.’’ Matt. XII-35-37. “EY

What Is Dour Life?

You and I are privileged to have a share in this
great adventure called living. What is it all about?
What is the meaning of our existence? What is
the true estimate of life?

There are those who say that life is a tale by
a fool, full of sound, and fury, signifying nothing.
Others say “life is the predicament that precedes
death’’; ‘‘a brief and diseredible episode on one of
the minor planets.’’ But there have always been
those who because they live in the cellar see no
mountains and, being deaf and blind, hear no music
and see no meaning in our existence.

What is YOUR LIFE? There are three false
estimates of life:

1. Life to some people consists of THINGS.
The biggest business in the world is the junk busi-
ness. Of course we don’t call it junk. It’s cars
and clothes, furnishings and finery, but in a few
years it is moth eaten and corroded. Jesus said,
‘(A man’s life consisteth not in the abundance of
the THINGS that he possesseth.’’

2. life to some people consists of THRILLS.
Some poor mortals argue that variety is the spice
of life but don’t have enough sense to realize one
ean’t live on spice.

3. Life to others spells THEORIES. Men are

ever seeking to find their way through the puzzle
of life with the candle of human reason, only to dis-
cover it eventually leaves them in the dark. Un-
belief is not intellectual; it is moral. ‘‘The fool hath
said in his heart there is no God.’’ Note, he didn’t
say it in his head—he knows better than that. The
way into God’s kingdom is not head first; much
rather, it is heart first.

4. Finally, Life to some people is TRUTH.
Wearily, Pontius Pilate, asked of Jesus, ‘‘ What is
truth?’’ Ie had listened to oriental jugglers, Greek
philosophers and Roman lawyers ranting about the
truth until he was in no position to realize that the
one standing before him was THE Truth. Truth,
we submit, is not a what, it is a WHOM. Jesus
said, ‘‘I am the Way, the Truth and the Life.’’ Para-
phrased, we have it, “‘I am the Way, without Me
there is no going; I am the Truth, without Me there
is no knowing; I am the Life, without Me there is
ino Mae,”

Life’s true estimate is Christ. He is The Truth.
Ile adds purpose, power, pardon and provision to
our existence. Those who follow Him will not walk
in darkness. May we be willing rather to suffer
for speaking the Truth, much rather than have the
Truth suffer for the want of speaking. “EY
