Amiable Al Rade, the wit of the Print Shop,
cornered our pup recently and had his tail wagging
in all directions with his dry humor. However, one
bit of his clowning took on a serious note when he
stated: “Next year I’m going all out for the Brierley
Chess trophy. I’m even having a little shelf built
for it now.”

There were those present who deemed this no
idle boast.

Your pup and all watching got a bellyful of
laughs watching Theodore Dennis valiantly try to
lift 185 pounds in the weight lifting contest. After
_no training and one (1) try, he quit in disgust. His
pre-contest statement was, “I can’t understand it;
T could lift more than that YEARS ago.”

The newest chess philosopher is Raymond
(Chesterfield) Walton, who after stacking his pri-
vate library with literature on chess, cannot under-

S ee

stand why he still loses. After playing a wild and
woolly game with our chess satellite (Chippy), he
was heard to mutter, “I’ve got it. I know the rea-

son now! These guys won’t play according to the
book.”

The pup really got a charge out of watching
“Ole” Perey MeCoy and John Stranahan tied up in
a game of horseshoes laced with the down-home dia-
logue of “Ole” Perey.

Surprisingly though, for his advanced years
and decades of prison life, Perey was more than a
match for John with his accuracy on ringing the peg.

Snoopy wondered aloud how two such crack
shots were unable to grab the institution title. How-
ever, after viewing Winkler, the champ, in action,
Snoopy had to admit Perey and John need a little
more practice, if not experience.

“Spare me from the guy who is forever using
the word “BUT” as a springboard to tear some poor
guy—who just happens not to be present— to
pieces,” admonished our classy friend from south of
the border, Cisco Cisneros.

Explaining to Snoopy, Cisco continued, “This

type of flannel-mouth will generally start ripping a
man’s reputation apart with a line something like
this: ‘Now don’t get me wrong, Jack’s a good guy,
BUT .... After this but, Jack begins to sound like
something you’d find under a rock. He’d sell out
his best friend, rat on his brother, rob his mother,
defraud his father, and steal your sweetheart. Then
after defining Jack as the worst kind of parasite
imaginable, our friend (?) generally winds up his
portrait (for protective reasons) with something
like this: ‘Like I said, don’t get me wrong, I like
Jack and I’d do anything for him. He’s a real sweet
Cavin BOMB ae

Snoopy sadly had to agree, Cisco was far too
right and we are all victims of the BUT BOYS.

Joe Battel and Bob Lightcap emerged, despite
the experts’ predictions, champions in this season’s
handball classies.

Under a broiling sun with temperatures rang-

Visiting the Big League ball diamond one even-
ing when a big event had just taken place (Phil
Locke’s amazing Rams had just dropped a 2 to 1
squealer), Snoopy looked in a corner. What did he
see? He found Mr. Locke practicing tear-jerking
with real honest-to-goodness tears.

Snoopy spotlights a worthy individual of E.S.P.
in the person of Robert “Little Mac” McNair. An
interesting aspect is to be found in his optimistic
outlook in his present environment. Having been
incarcerated since a youth of sixteen, we can laud
this person for his remarkable adjustment through
the years of his confinement. Having reached a ze-
nith of fifteen years in prison, he is looking ever for-
ward to his release and a realization of his hopes and
dreams. He has achieved an extended education
while imprisoned and has never doubted the im-
portance of it, and its significance. It has also served
to give him a mental awareness of the true value
of life in relation to social adjustments. This latter
named is of great value, and Mac gives his philosoph-
