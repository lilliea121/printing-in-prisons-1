“Old Timers Snuff Youngsters—22-19”

The final game of the season was
played in December, “62.” It was a

with five wins and no losses.

The “Cherry Hill Stadium”
filled to capacity—and the surround-
ing areas of the playing field were
choked with humanity and great clouds
of steam coming from the hundreds of
throats yelling for their favorite team
on this cold December morn. This was
the greatest rivalry of the year—and
expectations were running high to a
fever pitch. The Oldsters were a six
point favorite to win, but the Young-
sters were out to prove differently.

on his hands in overcoming the Young-

assault his veteran players of long
standing. Up front for the Oldsters
were Hank Myers, Tampa Red, Knock

“Blitzer’’ Parks. The ends were Sonny
Mays and Chief. In the backfield were
C.C. Clark, Suki and Rob Watson.

On four plays the Youngsters stood
off any drive the Oldsters might have
had in mind. The game see-sawed back
and forth for the first seven minutes
of the first period. The Youngsters

The Youngsters came roaring back
with a vengeance which put them in
scoring position, as one of their defen-
sive players intercepted one of Jake's
passes. With the fans screaming for
them to score, the (MVP) quarterback
of the season answered their shouts
with a twenty yard pass to Holly, who
then scampered in the end-zone with
the Youngsters’ first tally in the wan-
ing moments of the first period. Thus,
the period ended—Youngsters-6, Old-
sters-2. The point after touchdown was
missed, as the forward wall of the Old-
sters, ram amuck over the opposition
and kept them from scoring it.

Midway in the second period, Jake
threw a thirty yard pass to Sonny Mays,
who faked Holley (the speedster), flat
on his face, caught the bomb and went
over for the T.D. Jake then scored the
extra point by plunging over from the
one yard line. At half-time the score
remained 9—6, in favor of the Old-
sters.

The third period got off with a

called on Pigmeat, who was defending
against it. Instead of playing the ball,
he interfered with the receiver, and
this was to cost his team a T.D. In
the ensuing play, Griffin ran an option

sharply to his left and scored with only
light blocking necessary from his team-

did not know that a dark shadow of

heads.

With time of the essence now, the
Oldsters had to get moving—and move
they did—to the Youngsters’ 15 yard
line. Two plays later, Jake went over
with fine blocking from his forward
wall. All pandemonium broke loose as
he entered the end-zone with the most
beautiful touchdown scored that morn-
ing. This was the clincher for the Old-
sters, that spelled defeat for the Young-

sters.

Shaken by the final score, the Young-

to save time and get possession of the
ball which they sorely needed. With

gains, but this last one never reached
him. From his defensive position on
the left side, Sonny Mays played the
ball beautifully for the interception and

winning it, 22—19.
