THE EASTERN ECHO is printed by and for the inmates of the Eastern State Penitentiary at
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It’s Editors, or the Institution itself, cannot be held responsible for
plagiarism. The contents of the magazine are not copyrighted unless indicated, and permission to
reprint any material in this issue is cordially granted.

Dear Reader:

How deep is illusion,

‘how high the pie in the

sky? Two questions
which ECHO has not
forgotten belong togeth-
er. For we realize that
‘the moon at which our
fingers point is not the
moon’’ and that the
stars by which we navi-
gate this magazine are
only ... as we sight
and see them.

In this issue, ECHO
confronts several con-
troversial issues, not
presuming to solve them
but at least to call at-
tention to. If a favor-
ite illusion gets a bad
time, or if one of ours
seems mighty thin, re-
member man’s know-
ledge at best is only
probable stuff, and that
growth requires both
new insight and new
dreams. That much un-
derstood, may we re-
spectfully refer you to
such as: P-2, and the
hardest hitting piece in
the history of the fea-
ture page ‘‘From the
Warden’s Desk.’’ P-3,
““Cage One’’ where our
editorial sets a trap for
those who think twice.
P-4, ‘‘How Progressive
is Progressive Penolo-
gy,’’ wherein Andre L.
Paschedag says what he
has to say, yet so tact-
fully all of us go bump
in the gentlest way im-
aginable. P-7, where a
reprint from Argosy
Magazine by author Erle
Stanley Gardner will
and should bring us to
the very brink of reali-
ty. P-29, where L. J.
Biancone helps make
that edge even more ap-
parent. Hspecially for a
current inmate illusion
is P-8, where the Pa.
Prison Society begins to
come into a better focus,
and into its deserved
own. We can promise
you no one really gets
hurt on the journey to
these and other pages
in our magazine, but
only you can tell us how
much or how little you
like the thread of in-
quiry and opinion which
weaves through this,
our Fall Issue.
