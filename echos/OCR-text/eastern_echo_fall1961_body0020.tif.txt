Top right picture was taken of Eastern’s first print
shop at the beginning of the Century. In contrast is
shown how this simple shop has grown into a com-
plex plant. First the copy is given to the linotypist,
pictured in the top left, from there the copy and
type go to the compositors, also in the same picture.
The next step is locking up and transfer to the press-
room; middle and bottom left photo’s. Finally the
form is printed on one of the thirteen presses that
range from a small Job Press to the Double “O”’.
