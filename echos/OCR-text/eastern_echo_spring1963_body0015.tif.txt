the
card
detective

by Pete Tacso

‘Con-men, crooks, and card cheats,
in common with other people, enjoy a
vacation in the mountains. The only
difference is that these characters com-
bine business with pleasure. For in-
stance, resort hotels are happy hunting-
grounds for paste-board jugglers. All
of which is old stuff to a retired private
eye euphoniously known to the sharpies
as Bloodhound Thomas of Dade Coun-
ty. Some of the finest resorts in the
Catskills were in his territory before he
retired to the Florida sunshine. Rare,
indeed, was the day when the cop-for-
hire didn’t hear at least one bleat from
a sheared lamb.

However, when only a small amount of money
was involved, the suspect generally could be scared
into returning the loot, and no arrest was made.
That’s how Bloodhound Thomas operated with con-
siderable success. But occasionally a conniver like
Big Omaha Frank of more daring audacity, just
didn’t quail. In that case Thomas was required to
gather the evidence of chicanery. And sleuth it
down, he invariably did.

Bloodhound was always surprised at the clumsi-
ness of the cheats; the simple devices used to fleece
gullible victims. Where were the clever cardsters
he'd read about? Where were the suave tricksters
with fool-proof schemes> Were they figments of
the imagination, conjured up by sensation-seeking
novelists? Bloodhound had just about concluded
that this was so, when he met Big Omaha, an itiner-
ant cattle dealer from the Midlands. Perhaps it
would be better to say that Bloodhound met Neal
DeGoss, a retired stockbroker, because he came first.

Eastern Echo

DeGoss, like’ numerous others, had complained that

he’d been uchered. Unlike the others, however, he

didn’t want his money back. :

“lve been playing gin rummy with a character
known as Big Omaha Frank for more than a week,”
DeGoss told Bloodhound, ‘‘and I’ve lost an average
of $500 a day. He got so lucky, I got suspicious and
had my New York office check on him. They turned
up proof he’s an old-time con-man—a former razzle-
dazzle operator and count store agent of the Great
American Shows. He even had one of his fingers
shot off by a fellow-pitchman for peeping in cracker-
jack boxes. Anyway, I kept on playing because |
simply wanted to find out how the cheating was
done. So far, I've learned absolutely nothing.

“I don’t want,” he continued, ‘““Omaha arrested.
I don’t even want my losses returned. I only want
to satisfy my curiosity. Can | engage you to keep an
eye on the game? Perhaps you can learn what's
what.”
