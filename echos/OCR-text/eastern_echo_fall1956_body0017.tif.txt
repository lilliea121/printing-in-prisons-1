Ordinarily, he thought things over deliberately
before he did anything important, but this one time
he had acted almost spontaneously, almost as though
he didn’t want to analyze with cold logic his mo-
tives. He had met Betty and fallen in love with her
immediately, and because they were both young and
alone and desperately in love they had married
within the week. They spent their two-day honey-
moon in Chicago, and only yesterday had returned
to his room, where they would live until they found
an apartment.

John struggled to full consciousness and sat up
in bed. Betty had been gone from the room for a
long time. He wondered where she could be. He
looked round the room. Yes, her suitcase still lay
on the floor by the window. He lay back and re-
laxed, lighting a cigarette and puffing on it, blow-
ing the grey smoke at the ceiling. He heard run-
ning footsteps up the stairs and along the hall
toward his room.

Betty entered the room, carrying a small box
which she sat on the floor near her suitcase. ‘‘Hi
sleepyhead,’’ she called gaily. ‘‘You were sound
asleep, so I went back to my room to get the rest
of my things.’’ She mussed John’s hair playfully,
and bent to kiss him.

John drew her down on the bed and kissed her
passionately, with a fierce possessiveness, holding
her tight in his arms.

‘‘lay-a-bed,’’ she teased. ‘‘I’ve been up for
au oun 1 par time landlady and told her I
wouldn’t be back, packed all the rest of my things
and brought them over here, and all in the time you
caught your last forty winks.’’ She kissed his nose,
laughing.

John held her close to him and smiled at her,
stroking her lovely hair and her throat, feeling
wonderfully happy and full of his great love for
her. He drank in her loveliness with his eyes,
grateful to her for bringing him such joy and hap-

piness. She was his, his very own, and his hap-
piness in loving her was greater because he had
never had anyone before whom he could give his
love. He had always been alone, before, but now
he had Betty, and he felt somehow that he had al-
ways had her, that she had always been his, that
she had always been waiting for the mystic magic
moment when they would meet and unite.

She kissed him softly. ‘‘I love you, John,”’
she whispered.

““T love you, too, honey,’’ he said gruffly, hold-
ing her tight.

‘““But,’’ she said, taking his arms from around
her and pushing them to the bed, ‘‘but now you’d
better get up and we’ll have breakfast. I have a
million things to do.’’

He smiled at her lazily. ‘‘What important
things could you possibly have to do?’’

She flopped down on the floor beside the box

and suitcase. ‘‘Well,’’ she said slowly, ‘‘first of
all I have to decide what I want to throw away and
what I want to keep. I’ve been saving things for
years, but now that I’m your blushing bride there
may be some things I won’t want to keep any
longer.’’

‘‘Such as mementos of some of your former
boy-friends?’’ he said, teasing.

Betty laughed. “‘No, I don’t think I’ve kept
anything like that.’’ She turned back to the box
and opened it, rummaging through it, putting
some things on a pile to one side, clucking to herself
over some little thing which brought a pleasant
memory.

John watched her, smiling. Her happiness and
gayety were infectious. He had always been too
somber, much too serious, anyway, but now all that
would change, for he had Betty.

She took from the box a small album and,
jumping up, took it to John and sat beside him on
the bed. ‘I almost forgot I had this, it’s been so
long since I looked through the box,”’ she said.

‘What is it?’’ John asked lazily.

“Just an old album I’ve had for years and
years,’’ she said. ‘‘I thought you might like to
see some pictures of me when I was a child.’’

He kissed her. ‘‘You’re hardly more than a
child now.”’

“I’m only two years younger than you,’’ she
said, pouting.

‘coat’ Ss what I said. You’re hardly more than
a child, now.’’ Betty stuck her tongue out at him.

J ohn opened the album, which lay on Betty’s
lap. ‘‘“Who’s this?’’ he asked, pointing to a picture
of a middle-aged couple.

‘“They’re Mother and Daddy,”’ she said. ‘‘ Well,
not my real parents, I was adopted. They raised
me after my mother died. I always called them
Mother and Daddy, though. Oh! And that’s Mother
holding me,’’ she said. ‘‘That was right after they

took me to live with them.’’

““You must have been awfully young?’’ John
asked.

“‘T was. Mother died in childbirth, so when I
left the hospital I went right to live with Mother
and Daddy. They wanted a child, but couldn’t
have any, so when they heard about me, they made
arrangements to adopt me.”’

‘“Was your father dead, too?’’ John asked.

““Oh, yes. He died four months before I was
born. He was killed in an auto wreck, so I never
knew either of my parents. I’ve always wanted to
know about them, of course,’’ she went on, ‘‘but
Mother and Daddy were So ‘good and kind to me
that I eventually forgot about my real parents.”’
She turned the page. ‘‘Oh, that’s Daddy and me
in front of our home. I was about seven then, I
think. Don’t I look like the typical tom-boy with
