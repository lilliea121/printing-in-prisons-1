Rebuilding Typewriters and Wrecked Citizenships

This Edition’s spotlight beam—like electrons of
inspiration—is focused on Eastern’s Typewriter Re-
pair School, where the correlation between rebuild-
ing obstinate office machines and wrecked citizen-
Ships is seemingly synonymous.

Anyone who has ever had even a brief acquaint-
ance with a keyboard knows that a typewriter is a
somewhat complicated piece of mechanical equip-
ment. Not unlike some student-technicians prior to
enrollment, these machines become so badly mal-
adjusted that they cannot continue to produce satis-
factory work until the adjustments are returned to
factory standards. Rebuilding wrecked citizenships
is much the same.

The complexity of these machines, however, are
more readily understood than human nature. For
instance, the average standard machine contains
some 1800 to 2000 parts which require approximately
20,000 different factory operations to manufacture.
An experienced operator typing at a normal speed of
some 60 words per minute motivates approximately
10,000 parts per minute, approximating some 150
parts per second. In no other machine does so much
depend on the operator’s touch and rhythm. The
mechanic’s ability and skill required to maintain a

properly functioning machine is equally demanding.
In short, it may be similarly said, learning to repair
office machines may not be considered a cure-all for
wrecked citizenships, but an occupation which, de-
manding so much patience and self-discipline, may
help to develop these needed qualities in the average
practitioner.

In less than two years, Eastern’s Typewriter Re-
pair School has grown from an anemic one-man work
shop to a full-blooded 20-man classroom, comprising
10 full-time and 10 part-time students. equipped with
modern facilities capable of operating on a par with
factory-rebuilding standards. There is absolutely no
floundering around with theory. While there are
various text books and service literature available—
and frequently referred to—the student is permitted
to do the practical work from the moment of his en-
roliment and acceptance. However, owing to the na-
ture of this course only the more mature applicants
having a degree of proficient mechanical aptitude,
are considered for enrollment.

Not unlike penology, the school progressed for a
time in a hesitant, groping fashion under the tutelege
of an inmate instructor, whose proficiency and dem-
onstrated ability was somewhat handicapped by the
