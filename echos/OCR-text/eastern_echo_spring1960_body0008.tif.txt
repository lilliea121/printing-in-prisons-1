A Judge’s View of
Commutation in Pennsylvania

Hon, Judge Raymond Pace

The commutation of criminal sentences means the
reduction in the length of sentences, thereby effect-
ing the earlier discharge of prisoners. ' It may be con-
ditioned upon future behavior free from felonious
acts ? or it may be granted unconditionally, thereby
effecting an early discharge of a prisoner without
any further supervision over him by state author-
ities. * The granting of commutation is an exercise of
the sovereign power of the state. * It is considered an
act of mercy and is carried out by the Governor upon
the recommendation of the state officers who com-
prise the Board of Pardons.® Commutation differs
from pardon in that it merely reduces the punish-
ment, whereas, pardon obliterates the criminal of-
fense. ° While commutation reaches only the punish-
ment imposed for a crime, pardon erases both the
punishment and infamy attached thereto. *

There are two procedures for commutation of
sentences in Pennsylvania. The first is provided for
in the Constitution of the Commonwealth. * It applies
to the commutation of minimum sentences, thereby
making prisoners eligible for parole at an earlier date
under the Parole Act of 1941.° This procedure for
commutation should be exercised when it is believed
that the sentence imposed is unduly long for the
erime for which the prisoner has been convicted. All
mitigating and incriminating factors should be con-
sidered by the Board of Pardons in weighing the
sentence imposed by the trial judge which is alleged
to be unduly lone or harsh.

The second procedure for commutation has been
provided for by legislative enactment. '° It is based
upon the concept of good behavior of prisoners, but
applies only to flat sentences of prisoners which are
between one year and less than life, but in the case
of flat sentences of two years or more, only when the
Board of Parole has refused to grant parole prior to
the expiration of the flat sentence.!! Therefore, in
the vast majority of cases the act is not operative
until parole has been refused prior to the expiration
of the flat sentence by the Board of Parole. There-
after, if application is made for commutation under
the act, the Board of Trustees of the penal institution

has the power to recommend to the Board of Pardons
the amount of commutation to be allowed. '’ The
Board of Pardons, in turn, has discretionary power
to make an independent recommendation to the
Governor in each ease. The recommendations favor-
able to the prisoner necessarily depend upon a record
of good behavior during the term of imprisonment. '
Without a record of good behavior, an application
for commutation would seem to have little chance of
succeeding. As set forth in the Commutation Act,
good behavior should count towards the shortening
of sentences in every case where applicable and in
accordanee with the schedule provided in the act.
The schedule for commutation for good behavior is
as follows: two months for the first year, three
months for the second year, four months for the third
and fourth years and five months for each subsequent
eee, +=

However, the Commutation Act is of little con-
sequenee in Pennsylvania since it does not apply to
indefinite or indeterminate terms which are required
to be imposed upon anyone convicted of any crime
punishable by imprisonment in a state penitentiary.”
Indefinite or indeterminate terms are now required
in nearly all criminal convictions and are those terms
which set forth a minimum and maximum sentence. '°

Therefore, the issue surrounding the concept of
commutation in Pennsylvania narrows itself as to
whether or not new commutation legislation should
be enaeted which would apply to the indefinte or in-
determinate sentences imposed in nearly every case
today.

Kstablished periods of time off for good behavior
are undoubtedly important morale and incentive
factors to prison inmates. 17 The effect of such legis-
lation would be to diminish the minimum sentence
and thereby shorten the time in which prisoners
would be eligible for parole consideration. It would
also lengthen the time spent under supervision of
the parole authorities when release has been granted
by the Board. I would certainly favor such commuta-
tion legislation but believe that it should be enacted
in conjunction with an expanded program for reha-
