An Introduction
To Commutation

The Board of Pardons derives its authority di-
rectly from the set of fundamental principles by
which this Commonwealth is governed. Section 9 of
Article IV of the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1874
provides as follows:

‘‘He (the Governor) shall have power to remit
fines and forfeitures, to grant reprieves, commutations
of sentence and pardons, except in cases of impeach-
ment; but no pardon shall be granted, nor sentence
commuted, except upon recommendation in writing of
the Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of the Common-
wealth, Attorney General, and Secretary of Internal
Affairs, or any three of them, after full hearing, upon
due public notice and in open session, and such reconi-
mendation, with the reasons therefor at length, shall
be recorded and filed in the office of the Secretary of
the Commonwealth.’’

In general, the Board hears and makes recom-
mendations on applications of the following catego-
ries: (1) petition for commutation of a death pen-
alty to life imprisonment; (2) petition for commuta-
tion of minimum sentence to make the applicant
eligible for release after parole by the Board of Pa-
role; (3) petition for commutation of a life sentence
to make the applicant eligible for parole by the
Board of Parole; (4) petition for commutation of
maximum sentence of applicants on parole at the
present time; (5) petitions for complete pardons by
applicants not now serving any sentence for purposes
of clearing their records.

The Board of Pardons very rarely actually re-
leases a man from prison. Favorable action on their
part only makes an inmate eligible for the further
action of the Board of Parole. The two boards are
completely separate administrative bodies having
vastly differing functions. This is an important dis-
tinction which is often unrecognized.

The Governor cannot grant pardons or commute
sentences without first receiving a favorable recom-
mendation from the Board of Pardons, but he is not
bound by their favorable recommendation, and may
reject the same and refuse to grant clemency to the
applicant. However, the Governor cannot grant
clemency in any case where the Board of Pardons has
made an unfavorable recommendation. In those cases
involving court sentences of less than two years, the
sentencing judge has the right to parole the appli-
cant on his own authority.

Although the commutation of capital cases

i

draws the most publicity because of the usually high
public interest, such action is comparatively rare
when compared to the more common “commutation
of minimum sentence.” The use of a hypothetical
situation permits the most graphic method of ex-
plaining the procedures involved in such commuta-
tion.

Let us say that John Doe was convicted of the
charge of Armed Robbery in 1954, and sentenced to
serve ten to twenty years in the state penitentiary.
This means that his minimum sentence is ten years,
and at the expiration of that time he will be eligible
to appear in front of the Parole Board. Through
their action he may be released to serve the remain-
der of his twenty years on parole. This procedure
has no connection with the workings of the Board
of Pardons.

Since we are dealing with a hypothetical case,
let us give John Doe the benefit of a hypothetical
partner, Paul Jones. Paul Jones was tried under a
different judge, and after being found guilty of the
charge was sentenced to five to ten years. The two
sentences were perhaps inequitable, but many
instances of such variance in sentencing procedure
may be found in the records of our courts.

This being 1960, Paul Jones was released on pa-
role upon the action of the Parole Board after serv-
ing his minimum of five years. John Doe, found
guilty of the same crime, still faces five years of im-
prisonment before becoming eligible for parole
action. Having during his previous years of confine-
ment taken advantage of all avenues open to him in-
sofar as rehabilitative efforts are concerned, and
feeling confident that he deserves some further con-
sideration in view of the individual facts of his case,
John Doe files for commutation of his ten year mini-
mum so that he may, like his partner, apply for
parole.

To do this he obtains from the Seeretary of the
Board of Pardons a set of ten copies of the prescribed
form which he must use for his application. A fee of
two dollars must be paid for these forms. His appli-
cation is then filed with the Board with a payment of
a fifteen dollar filing fee which is not refundable.

A copy of his application will be sent by the
Board of Pardons to the court and to the District
Attorney of the county from which the applicant was
