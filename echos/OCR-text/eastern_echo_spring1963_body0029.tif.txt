So the place is an old fire trap; that’s no reason
for them to put signs all around saying, “Don’t

Smoke in Bed, the ashes on the floor may be YOU.”’

Well, that about covers the situation, outside of
the fact that the new inmates arriving here seem
strange. I have a new cell partner; he’s so shy and
backward, that when I say ‘“‘good morning”’ to him,
he can’t think of an answer. To show you what |
mean, he enrolled in school here and was promoted,
just because he was the closest to the correct answer
when the teacher asked,“‘How many legs does a
dog have>?”’ He said three.

engage in prostitution or homosexuality. Invariably,
he becomes a “‘pusher,” selling rediluted drugs to
other addicts to insure his own supply; even to the
extent of contaminating non-addicts by inducing
them to try a “‘free’’ sample. Thus addicts are multi-
plied with hare-like frequency.

Conscientious people interested in these aspects
of drug addiction, realize there is no panacea for the
problem; (least of all, filling jails with addicts) that
there are, as yet, no experts in the field, and there is
no easy cure for the disease. These people also re-
alize that the addict must not only have hospital
treatment for withdrawal, but psychiatric treatment
to get at the root of his personality disorder. De-
toxification, as it is called, is a relatively simple proc-
ess. In part, due to the poor quality of the heroin
available on the streets to most addicts, actual phy-
sical dependence is not overly-strong. It is the ex-
tremely strong psychological dependence, however,
that is the real obstacle to breaking the habit.

Because he is so often passive to the point of be-
ing apathetic, the addict, in common with men who
have served long prison terms, needs a lot of direc-
tion and support, sometimes for several years after
he has “‘kicked”’ the habit. This need for long-range,
patient treatment, with inevitable lapses, setbacks
and discouragements, however minor or slight, has
generated the notion that narcotics addiction is a
hopeless disease. Actually it isn’t, but so little is
known about it and the percentage of known “‘cures”’
has been so small, that some people are hesitant
about committing government and private funds and

personnel to a project with no ironclad guarantee of
results.

Public impatience and the American penchant for
quick, sure-fire solutions have so far produced noth-
ing but increasing criticism of paroling authorities,
strident demands for stricter law enforcement, and
heavier penalties for these hapless creatures. These
range from sending all addicts to prison for life, or
putting them all ‘“‘away’’ on an island to, as a last
resort, capital punishment.

It is my intention in this article to defend these
men and point out to you what really is to blame.
Our current projection crew consists of Joseph An-
toniewicz, Socrates Cantoral, Felix Capone and Bel-
isario Cantoral. Joe and Socrates are both licensed
projectionists, and all four men are highly qualified
and experienced operators. ~The equipment they
work with is thirty-five years old; it was installed
the same year Lindburg first spanned the Atlantic.
Most worn and broken parts for the machinery are
obsolete, cannot be purchased, and must be salvaged
from theatres which discarded this type of equip-
ment twenty years ago. The amplification system
is so obsolete that one major mishap and we will be
without movies at all. The noticeable volume change
we experience every eighteen minutes, is due to this
faulty and erratic amplification system. It is only the
skill of our operators that keeps it as good as it is.
Only new equipment can correct it. Without a syn-
chronized monitor in the projection booth, the oper-
ator has no way of telling when the volume is not
right. It is sad indeed, that we must holler and yell
in order to inform the operator that he must adjust
the volume, but with the present system, it is the
only way. Quite often the picture will disappear
from the screen completely with the sound continu-
ing. This is caused when a small motor fails to keep
two carbons properly spaced. The operator has no
control whatsoever over this.

Because of this obsolete equipment, our choice of
films is restricted to the old and third rate, for we
don’t have the facilities to project the newer, up to
date cinamascope size films. These old films are dry
and brittle and break quite often. The operator can
do nothing but splice the film and continue the show.
In almost every instance when something goes
wrong, it is the fault of the old, worn-out and obso-
lete equipment. Not only do our projectionists keep
machinery running that should have been discarded

_ twenty years ago, but they do an excellent job. Let’s

remember the next time something goes wrong, what
is really at fault and commend, rather than criticize
our harried operators.
