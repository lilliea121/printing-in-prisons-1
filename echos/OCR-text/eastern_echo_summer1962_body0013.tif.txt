“And I kept on meeting new people always
willing to assist me in helping others. When the ad-
ministrations changed at the prison, from time to
time, Warden Burke cooperated fully, as did Ward-
en Tees behind him. Tees was a personal friend of
mine for over thirty years. When Mr. Banmiller be-
came Warden, | must say that both he and Major
Joseph R. Brierley have been very kind and gener-
ous with their cooperation.

“You see, this is not a one man job. I| was fortu-
nate enough to receive the help of all these people.”

In addition to his parole work, Mr. Paull visits
Eastern each Sunday. He never fails to inquire as to
the individual well-being of the prisoners he knows
and with whom he is working. On innumerable oc-
casions, he has left money for inmates cut of his own
pocket. A sick inmate friend can always count on a
visit from Paull during his stay in the hospital.

In yet another phase of his work, Mr. Paull pro-
vides the food for the Jewish Holidays—bringing it
in himself. Together with the other members of
B'nai B'rith, he attends the Holiday Services here in
the institution.

These efforts have not gone unnoticed by fellow
workers and other interested persons. On February

14, 1949 Joe Paull received The Shrine of Liberty

Man of the Month Award, “‘In recognition of his out-
standing services rendered his fellow man when in
Furey Ellis, Chairman of the
Committee of Awards, affixed his signature to the
citation accompanying the gold medal.

Again, Robert H. Fleisher, son of Albert W., of
the Personal Aid Bureau of the Jewish Family Ser-
vice—of which Mr. Paull is also a member—ex-
pressed his opinion, and with the deepest sincerity,
that he considers Joe Paull to be America’s No. |
professional amateur in this field of work.

During the Jewish Festival of Light, there is a cer-
emony which takes place in the homes. A candle is
lit and used to lend its light to the other Hanukkah
candles. Because of this, it is called ‘“‘the servant
candle.’ So like Mr. Paull who, by deed, lights the
fire of compassion and understanding in others, so
that they, too, might help those of us who are in
need of assistance. Who by deed, brings the prob-
lems of the holdover into the light. Who by deed,
serves and continues to serve his fellow men in help-
ing them regain their place in free society by person-
ally supplying some of the prime necessities for re-
lease, a job, a home and a sponsor, thus, assuring
the releasee the self-respecting means by which a
man can fashion a decent life in freedom. . . for him-
self, and ultimately for society, also.
