Jack Dempsey
Manassa Mauler

by Bill Brazell

From out of the west, drifted one of the best,
Jack Dempsey, Manassa Mauler,
Riding freight trains, not knowing waere to go,
t'was the life that turned Jack to Hobo
Fighting his way from town to town,

Savege look, with scowl and frown.

The cry of the fans and yell from some,
“Where did this character come from?

Brought to Crum Lymn,

Baron Doughertys, training camp “for him.”

Tex Richards guess, was tne best in memory,
He would be the greatest drawing card of the century.
Cpeed and punch, terrific power.

Making name and fame, man of the hour.

Train to perfection, along with skill.

Courageous was he, and out for the kill.

From Butte, Montana to Toledo, Ohio,

History repeats, like David and Goliath.
Newpapers flash, sensational lines,

The giant Willard dropped, seven times.

Hign lights of history as shown on the screen,
t'was July the fourth, back in nineteen nineteen,
in the roaring twenties, who can forget,

The idol of millions, lives hearty respect.

To those that don’t know, and have never seen,
His liberal donations to those that in need come to him.
Jack Dempsey, U.S. most popular champion.

Reflectus
By Samuel L. McKelyn

The eyes hold visual! reflections of the soul,

The soul builds of mentel directions to each goal,

E’er to each soul; holds but whats been taught, to wnats been tho’t,
he mind and soul; holds but whats been taught, to whats been tho’t,

And tnus but stands erected to each of mind to soul, waat,

E’er has been wrought,

Ah but of eacn soul, from mind to soul, was each that tho’t,

And tnus each bulds to mind to soul, but what each,

Tho't ef each has brought.

HERITAGEOUS

We true Americans whom vie to live and grow,

Well witn the best of lessons e’er we sow,

And thus must we but teach as all should show,

The ways of but our American ways we know,

And thus must we be as Reeds of Grass that winds upon does blow.
But lo, and ah, the Reed indeed does rocketh to and fro,

And thru our iils and hardships, must we but truely go on, so,

And Righteousness and Justices Rivers but ever flow,

And knowledge and humans worth in true deep do keep,
Americans from woe.
