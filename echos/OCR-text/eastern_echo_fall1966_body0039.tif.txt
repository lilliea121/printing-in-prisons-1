PACKERS

The PACKERS, ‘‘shoo-ins,’’ odds-on-favorites,
just about everybody’s pick to win it ‘‘all’’ hands
down, ete.

This imposing array of talent gathered together
in early August, started practicing in earnest, and
seemed destined to make a shambles of any and all
opposition. What happened between then and the end
of the season frustrated the team, disappointed its
followers and baffled the experts. Four losses, four
scoreless ties, and not a single victory is indeed an
unimpressive showing. And yet they really didn’t
play as badly as all this would seem to indicate.

A big, aggressive line including: John Amato,
Charley Gindle, Robert Stubblebein, Dennis Shields,
Jimmy Sezulzewski, Frank Gambino, Bobby Lightkep
as the “‘lonely end’’ (he hadn’t heard about Dial)
and ‘‘Kookie’’ Nash provided good blocking for the
running of Jerry Richardson, Ed ‘‘Scooter’’ Scoleri,
Ray Thompson and Arthur ‘‘Blackie’’ Brodman. He,
incidently, bore the brunt of the criticism in regards
to the failure to win (A winning team is a good team,
a loser always has a bum coach, dumb quarterback,
ete.). The defensive specialists were Charles ‘‘Rocky’’
Negri, Edward “‘Big Ed’’ Brewer, James ‘‘Smiley”’
Crowson, Joseph Haler, Richard Edwards, George
Jamitowski and Ralph Hiester. Good football players
to the last man, which makes the results of their
efforts all the more of a mystery.

Ralph “‘Thunder’’ Staino who was to have sup-
plied the power running from the fullback spot, was
afflicted by a massive paranychia (hang nail of the
big toe) which resulted in his being sidelined the
entire season. Having listened to other reasons and
excuses advanced for the Packers dismal showing . . .
sort of makes me wonder what might have been if... .

‘‘Jerry’’ Richardson, the little halfback with the
big heart, fractured both bones in his lower right leg.
We all wish him a speedy and complete recovery.

Fall 1966

OLD MEN AGAIN BEAT YOUNGSTERS

Unlike most holidays within these ‘‘unhallowed’’
walls, Thanksgiving Davy is an eagerly awaited occa-
sion—for it means the annual ‘‘old’’ men vs. young
men’s football game.

It is flattering, if one is touching forty, to watch
youth’s physical extravagances being pitted against
the cerebral cunning of age. If one is twenty-five, it
is distressing to see youthful vigor expended in a
futile attempt to overcome experience and know-how.

That’s how it was, Thanksgiving 1966—at least
during the first half of the game, during which the
young-at-heart old men scored all of their 15 points
in a 15 to 12 victory—yea! ‘‘Old folks.’’

Effortlessly, at first, the aging—ageless—athletes,
ran all over and around the ‘‘young lions.’’ Harry
Zietz, playing what might well have been his finest
game, displayed remarkable efficiency handling and
throwing the ball. With dead-eye accuracy, Harry
lofted a ‘‘bomb’’ to ‘‘Flip’’ Fleming before the game
was five minutes old. (It simply isn’t true oxygen
was administered to our hero immediately thereafter. )
Calvin Milligan, a brilliant runner in everybody’s
book, young or old, scored the second t.d. on a nifty
ramble of 25 yards. “‘Snako’’ Welty, with the help
of his trusty cane, kicked a field goal for the winning
margin of victory.

Of course no one knew, after half time, that
the old guys would win. As the second half got
underway, odds were off that they would even finish
afoot. The youngsters hurled themselves furiously at
the opposing line with a freshness that augered ill
for the tiring old men. Vim, vigor and Hadocol
seemed cruelly to have deserted them; limbs simply
could not execute what mind and experience could
See so well. The game, moving to its final stages,
became a very threatening thing for them as the
youngsters relentlessly kept the pressure on the slowly
wilting defensive team.

Sheer brawn availed them naught. The final gun
sounded, and despite a mighty last ditch surge, the
youngsters had failed to pull it off.

Lomax, Roosevelt, ‘‘ Big Hank’’ and Massey (who
scored on a 60 yard scamper which he will describe
in detail at anytime) and their youthful teammates
will have to wait until next year to taste (perhaps)
the fruits of victory.

“MIDGET”? FOOTBALL

As we tended to the myriad of last minute details
just prior to going to press, it was brought to my
attention that football is still “‘big’’ on the E.S.P.
gridiron scene. So, venturing forth this past week-
end to satisfy both my curiosity and a request for
Echo publicity, I encountered a titanic struggle of
lilliputians. Two teams of lightweights, mosquito-
weights, ete., like really small, having a ‘‘ball.’’

Warren ‘‘Biggie’’ Zachary coaches and quarter-
backs one team, and William ‘‘Red’’ Smith the other.
Weather permitting they will be holding forth each
Sunday a.m. for the next three weeks and hope to
See your face among the sideline crowd.
