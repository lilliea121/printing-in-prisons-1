ercise these powers are just as subject to emotions
that can sway their sound and rightful judgements.
Yet, the long-timers can only hope, pray, and keep
on striving to prove ‘they are not the men today that
their crime labeled them to be yesterday.”

Throughout the penal world there are minorities
who truly do not warrant consideration on society's
part. All too often their recidivistic actions are felt
through condemnation of prisoners as a whole. Men
in prison striving mentally and physically to become
decent individuals see their hopes soar away. We
realize that one individual's actions should not be a
determining factor for all. Yet, this is not so, for the
notoriety heralded is an influencing aspect in veering
intelligent minds from logical reasoning.

In a society that advocates both rehabilitation and
lengthy minimum sentences, a commutation board is
an absolute necessity. Were it not for this fact, a
man with a minimum sentence exceeding his life span
would be in the position of building bridges in space
—the bridge in this instance representing an effort
to show society that men do change when given the
opportunity.

The majority of long termers wish to show that
they are trying to build the foundation for a new life
upon release. The Pardon Board is also aware of
this, but the public, in its ignorance of the facts, often
castigates the board. And in doing so, exhibits mor-
onic judgement. It is this same public who affirmed
the selection of the members, with a firm belief in
their integrity. These and many other derogatory

influences are instrumental in the impediment of
mercy and justice for the deserving individuals.

It has been said, and will be quoted by many
learned men throughout the United States, that “‘the
human animal can only be caged a certain length of
years, and past that point demoralization takes
over.

There are four stages of emotion which an incar-
cerated man experiences while doing time: five
years optimism; ten years’ hope; fifteen years’ passi-
vity; twenty years non-hope and despair. These are
not statistics nor a census report, but a knowledge of
my fellowman’s hopes, dreams, and despairs after
many years in an identical situation. These four la-
bels can be lengthened out to fill many novels with
idealistic hopes of the man in prison. It is quite use-
less to cite them here, as this article's main theme is
to elaborate briefly on the specialized subject of
“Man and Commutation.”

Modern Penology’s progressive theme has been
encouraging, but has not yet been fully understood
by most people. Penology’s main point is not ad-
vocation of crime, but more rehabilitative opportu-

The Reward of Faith

They look upon faith as some kind of
out pops the reward. For charity, you get good
health and for prayer, peace of mind.

We can certainly blame our shamelessly material-
istic society. Who can ignore the ideology of the
““What-did-you-do-for-me-lately’> school, which is
the uncrowned monarch of the market, the home,
and the parlor?

The real culprit however, resides in a stunted and
immature religious development of most people to-
day. We look upon religion as a crutch, an aid, a dis-
penser of psychological palliatives and socio-politi-
cal necessities.

The sages of the Talmud were not experts on
rockets and missiles; but they did know that the re-
ward for a good deed is another good deed. And
what is the reward of faith?—More faith!
