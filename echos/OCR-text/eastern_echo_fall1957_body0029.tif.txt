pulsively, he wheeled a book end at the man, which
crashed through an upper pane, bringing the whole
family on the run.

‘“What happened, what’s wrong?’’ they asked
breathlessly.

A guy ..im.a uniform ... was peeping... in
that window. I know it’s impossible, but I saw
him,’’ Dave blurted out.

‘“In a confederate uniform ?”’

‘“Yeah, come to think of it, it was a confederate
uniform,’’ the mystified Dave replied.

With that, one of the small children matter-of-
factly commented, ‘‘Oh, that,’’ and the family
turned and trooped out.

Dave flew after them. ‘‘What do you mean,
‘Oh, that.” What’s a guy in Confederate uniform
doing out there anyhow?’’ he sputtered.

“Oh, that’s just our ghost.’’

1?

‘‘Just our ghost... !
‘‘Don’t worry, he’s a beneficial ghost.’’

Dave swears that he saw the figure on two other
occasions . . . once in his own bedroom where the
ghost sat rocking in a chair before his very eyes.

‘““What did I say to him? Nothing. He
wasn’t bothering me and I sure wasn’t about to both-
er him!’’

Howard, known to be a total abstainer, swears
it’s all recorded about a Confederate Ghost in the
Historical Society of Woodbury, New Jersey. Or
was that the ... Hysterical Society?

Who Runs Last, Lasts Best q_.& 7 andieee

In the opinions of Clarence Miles and Henry
Nichols:

‘Trish runs the best in the 100 yard dash of
anyone we ever saw. He has all the right express-
ions! He’s got ‘oomph’. And he gives it all the
effort he’s got. You have to give the little guy
eredit!’’

Talent-wise, Snoopy gives the ‘‘Big I’’ all the
credit in the world... for being a gifted cartoonist,
and wonders why Irish doesn’t try to market his
stuff. It is really good.

Wot Hoppened! ie” Ya

From Mr. Phillippe, via correspondent Lou
Biancone, straight to Snoopy comes this, the latest
episode in the new life of ‘‘Grouchy Gump’’, former
D-5887.

A recently commuted Lifer, Grouchy Gump ac-
cepted a cashier’s draft in lieu of cash at time of be-
ing signed out. Gump’s earnings over his many

years spent in prison were involved. But when he
attempted to cash the check ... it bounced! The
figures were slightly blurred.

Gump asked the bank to call up the authorities
here at the pen. For some reason, the bank refused.
Said Gump plaintively, ‘‘Look here, fellows. I’ve
been out of circulation for the last 18 years. I don’t
know what’s happening!”’

Nevertheless, Gump had to hot-foot it back to
the institution, supposedly to obtain a new check.
This time, however, he asked for something every-
body can understand: that good green American
eash!

Snoopy Remembers the Doctor

Born 12-6-1872 in Clinton, N. J., graduate of
University of Pennsylvania, Class of 1898, and, to
the very end, tastefully dapper and dignified, Nath-
aniel S. Yawger, M. D., Psychiatrist here, passed
away quietly in his sleep during the night of June
2nd. Formerly Medical Supt. to Burn Brae Hospi-
tal for Nervous and Mental Diseases; Consulting
Neurologist to the Norristown State Hospital; Com-
mitting Physician, Psychopathic Dept., Philadelphia
Hospital; and on the teaching staff of the Jefferson
Medical College (to mention a few of his many one-
time posts) . .. Dr. Yawger climaxed his life in
years spent working with the inmates under mental
observation at EH. S. P.

Snoopy had a special regard for this man and
felt as close to him as he could feel to any civilian
working in the penitentiary. He recalls such say-
ings of the doctor as, ‘‘Fifty per cent of what’s
wrong with my patients could be completely cured
by opening the Front Gate. In too many eases it
is originally the sentences which are unbalanced,
not the prisoners who have to serve them!’’—and,
‘‘There is no substitute for kindness.’’

Perhaps the most unforgettable experience con-
cerning the good doctor happened in 1951 when
Snoopy clerked for him. It seems Snoopy had done
some research and typing he was rather proud of.
The doctor thought the job an excellent one, said so,
then smiled and asked for a glass of water. But the
water wasn’t for drinking! What happened when
Snoopy was asked to insert his paw into the water,
then pull it out again, you can guess.

‘“You’d never know you had even been there,
would you, Snoopy ?’’

Snoopy muttered, ‘‘Rats to you, too, Sir.’’
