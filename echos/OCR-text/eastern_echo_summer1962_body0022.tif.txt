In one hundred years of criminological ren-
derings, | know of no effort which has attempted to
understand the abstract question of crime from a
standpoint of that underlying “‘stuff’’ which con-
stitutes the mainsprings of all human striving. Call
it what you will—Self-preservation, the will to pow-

After a half million years of the same kind of
conduct, it should be abundantly clear that man is
governed primarily by natural law as certain and as
immutable as the laws in accordance with which all
physical bodies behave. To attempt to change that
phenomenon by which every particle of matter in the
