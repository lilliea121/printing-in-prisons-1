boys will be homeless? Since the local police cleaned
up Locust street, closed the Strip Palaces, Coffee
Houses and Poolrooms, where can they go? We
have 14 inmates here now who are recovering from
silicosis, just from inhaling the chalk dust in those
poolrooms. Don’t send these boys away from here,
Send Them To Camp, not back to the chalk dust of
Lefty’s Billiard Parlor. In fact, Lefty just arrived here
too. He just requested a fire hydrant for his cell; he’s
so lazy he won’t even take his dog out for a walk. He
was convicted of making money with President’s pic-
tures that weren’t even elected yet. He’s lucky
though, he has a wife and a cigarette lighter and
they are both working.

Getting back to the mental out-look of the men
who are confined here. Nostalgia and fear are two
important factors that should be taken into consid-
eration before removing the Pen. Nostalgia for the
many things here that each inmate has grown ac-
customed to; like the musical sounds of leaky ceil-
ings; you see, leaks are not stopped here, they just
transfer them periodically to other locations. Actu-
ally the leaks are conversation starters around the
institution; it's not uncommon to hear two inmates
greet each other with the inquiry, “‘Have you had a
good leak lately."” Many times | have indulged my-
self in voluntary inertia, by lying abed and watch-
ing the little streams of dirty, contaminated water
running down my wall. How I would laugh when
morning came and my shoes had floated away. |
would tippy-toe through the puddles with the
drowned roaches and recover them (my shoes, not
the roaches) with great shouts of ‘“Eureka.’’ Then
before breakfast | would sweep up the wet soggy
plaster that had fallen from the wall during the
night. I would watch with fascination as the roaches

and big water bugs raced like mad to new little
places to hide away.

Where else but here at the “‘Cherry Hill Taj Ma-
hal” could | greet the friendly little family of five,
three-inch Shadd roaches—every evening they ar-
rive walking single file up my wall, the papa in the
lead, then mama and the three babies; number three
is my favorite—he always waves his antenna at me
when he passes. I usually smile and wave back at
him. Even with my eyes shut | know when they have
arrived, for their little feet are calloused from walk-
ing on the damp concrete, and when walking they
sound as if they had wooden shoes on. I'll miss the
patter of those little feet if they transfer me. How
we all laughed when they assigned three ex-gunmen
to exterminate the roaches; they were eventually
transferred to the Laundry because they lacked the
killer instinct. I think the roaches have their own
table now in the mess hall—that is, most of them, for
we have a few at our table; in fact, I don’t eat raisin
bread anymore, ever since | saw a raisin walk off
my plate.

Who would ever want to lose our little 12x6 foot
community shower room, three little overhead
sprinklers for 50 men. Always so happily crowded,
everyone chatting so gaily—such fun standing there
full of soap when the water pressure would suddenly
slacken off for 15 or 20 minutes, how we would
laugh and itch—I scratched my leg for five minutes
before | realized it was somebody else’s, and that
mine wasn t numb at all as I feared.

Things like that are to be expected; after all, the
wooden water pipes were installed in 1825 by a
crew of pioneers who were doing time here for sell-
ing wooden nut-megs to the local indians who were
passing by. Anyway, it’s so dull here that when the
