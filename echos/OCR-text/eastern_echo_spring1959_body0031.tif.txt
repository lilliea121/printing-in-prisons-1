rated, and they have already demonstrated their de-
sires toward integration with the Galactic League
-by sending a rocket to our planet. According to our
Main Observatory this rocket, which very possibly
contains their emissary, will make its landing on
Mars tomorrow morning.”

The next morning 200,000 Martians came to
greet the emissary from Planet #3. They strained
against the linked arms of the guards who surround-
ed the landing area as plotted by the astronomers.
The official party of the Prime Consul and his aides
waited tensely for the arrival of the rocket. Sudden-
ly, the rocket arched into view with a loud roar and
pointed its nose towards the designated landing area.
The crowd “ah’d” as the rocket zoomed towards the
eround, then “ooh’d” as it hit and entered the
ground, leaving only a smoking hole to indicate its
arrival.

Into each life some terrain must fall.

“What on Mars happened?” asked the Prime
Consul, as the band struck up with “Hail to the
Universe.”

“T think his brakes failed,” said an aide. _

While the official party and the crowd waited
anxiously, a crew of engineers cautiously investigat-
ed the hole. They reported to a disappointed audi-
ence that it would take at least two days to dig up
the rocket. The Prime Consul and his party left
immediately, and though some of the crowd loitered
about, the landing area was deserted by the second
night of recovery operations except for the hard-
working crew of diggers.

Thus it was that the emissary from Planet #5,
a hungry, battered, and very shook-up_ spider-
monkey named “Henry”, was released from his rock-
et and greeted by a group of low-class Martian labor-
ers rather than a brass band and the Prime Consul.

A few minutes later the foreman of the laborers
called the Prime Consul’s secretary. “We’ve got that
there thing from Planet #3 uncovered. What do you
want us to do with him?”

The seeretary answered superciliously, “You
happen to be talking about the official emissary of
that planet, my good man, and I’m certain he is not
a thing. As the first man from Planet £3 to visit
Mars, he must be highly thought of in the official
eireles of that goverment to be entrusted with such
a mission. Please invite him to the Prime Consul’s
office, and try to be a little formal, please. He must
be handled with care.”

“Yowre darn tootin he has to be handled with
care,” answered the foreman. “He just bit one of
my helpers, and right now he’s hanging by his tail
from the top of our crane.”

seerctary. “Well, no doubt something like that was
to be expected since you have had no training in
handling foreign dignitaries. But... hanging by
his tail, did you say? That does seem extraordinary.”

“Oh, he’s a weird one, all right,” said the fore-

have to coax him a little with a shovel, but Vl get
him there.”

“Don’t you dare!” screamed the secretary. “Mis-
handling a representative of a foreign planet like
that may result in an interplanetary war. Act with
dignity at all times. Now hurry along.”

Catching Henry, who was thoroughly bewilder-
ed on his first trip away from home, took some time,
but finally the laborers gathered him in and marched,
or rather, carried him to the Prime Consul’s office.

Because of Henry’s rather peculiar behavior the
banquets and public appearances honoring his visit
were postponed while the Prime Consul’s personal
staff of psychologists, psychiatrists, neurologists, so-
clologists, and just plain brain-pickers, made a mass
attack upon the problem of: understanding their
strange visitor from a fellow planet. After three
days of such examination a conference was called in
the Prime Consul’s office to discuss Henry’s status.

The general consensus seemed to be that Henry
was either “not quite all there,” or just plain dumb.
During their tests he had offered no intelligent co-
operation, spending most of his time scratching him-
self, swinging from chandeliers, and generally rais-
ing hell, accompanying his actions by a steady
stream of chitter-chatter which was completely
unintelligible even to the experts of the language
school. One of the consultants had made the claim
that he had made contact with Henry and under-
stood him completely, however his colleagues were
inclined to doubt him since he now spent the greater
part of his time swinging on the chandeliers with
Henry.

You just haye to be a monkey to take this trip.

In view of these considerations they could reach
only one conclusion. That the rocket from Planet #3
was a freak occurence, and that Henry and his fellow
“humans?” were really not civilized and had merely
accidentally stumbled upon the proper way to con-
struct a rocketship. This was in line with the well-
known theory that ten idiots, each given a type-
writer and enough paper, would eventually accident-
ally type an understandable novel. Thus, it followed
that Planet #3 was not yet ready for spatial inte-
gration and that Henry must be returned to his
native habitat lest his absence cause a “missing link”
in the evolution of his species. It was agreed that
no further efforts would be made to contact Planet
#3 until a reasonable length of time had passed to
permit Henry’s descendants to become ¢ivilized—
say, 3,000,000 years or so.

So, without ceremony, the rocket from Planet #3
was refitted and Henry started on his return trip
from Mars. Having begun this expedition with
noticeable reluctance, and now thoroughly indignant
about the events of the past few days, Henry sat
encased in his straitjacket, chattering to himself,
