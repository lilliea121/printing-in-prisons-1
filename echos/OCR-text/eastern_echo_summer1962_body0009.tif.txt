CRIMINOLOGY

AA discussion of ways &F means

On Monday, January 28, 1957, Professor Negley
K. Teeters, Criminologist, sat behind closed doors
with a group of inmates who comprise the staff of
the EASTERN ECHO. The main purpose of the
meeting was to discuss ways and means of lessening
the adverse publicity given to prisoners and ex-con-
victs by some member papers of the free press.

Sensing a slightly strained atmosphere, due per-
haps te the unusual and unprecedented nature of the
meeting, Dr. Teeters took the verbal initiative. His
evident sincerity, friendliness, and just-right inflec-
tions and asides soon dispelled the air of constraint
and kicked off a sizzling discussion that lasted about
three hours.

PRIME TARGET SEEN

ECHO had dedicated itself to improving prisoner-
public relations. Its staff knew, as do all the inmates
here, that an “unfavorable press’ hampered any
movement to create a more realistic and fair picture
of the prisoner in the mind of the public. What to
do about the situation, however, waited upon the
suggestion of the professor.

TARGET’S TARGET EXPLAINED

Clarifying present editorial and public attitudes,
he pointed out: a man could be arrested without too
great a stigma being placed upon him. Even con-
victed and sent to a penitentiary, the stigma was not
too pronounced. Usually, only a man’s immediate
family and neighborhood were concerned. But once

released, or about to be released from prison as an
“ex-convict, the full burden is upon him.

“It’s not the criminal who frightens us. It’s the
ex-convict, and so the man trying to become an EX-
convict. Apparently, it is the time spent in prison
that creates our uneasiness. What Harry Barnes calls
the ‘convict bogey, the professor explained. Why
this fear of the ex-con? ‘What else! The abnormal
atmosphere of the prison negates all the human at-
tributes of a man. Prison is the reverse of the out-
side situation. You see, we really do know what hap-
pens to a man who undergoes confinement. That
knowledge is often expressed in society's reaction to
his return.”

DIRECT CONTACT URGED

After discussion of this and other problems basic
to the situation, Dr. Teeters recommended direct
contact with the local newspapers. It was agreed that
the Editor of this magazine would write to the three
leading newspapers in this area, requesting an inter-
view for ECHO staff with their representatives. It
was further agreed that the only possible approach
to gaining a more favorable press’ was to explain
ECHO aims and request cooperation of the news-
papers in presenting and furthering them. Also to
be asked, specifically, was that they separate the in-
dividual from the labels “‘con’’ and “‘ex-con”’ in their
reporting, on the theory that the public could only
gain a true picture of prisoners by seeing them as
they exist, individually. Which, naturally, must re-
sult in the recognition that they are, after all, only
people... with problems.
