For the inmate, by his toil is afforded the
chance of regaining his self-respect, for it makes him
self-supporting, and no matter what is written it must
be remembered that inmates must learn to work and
not merely make motions at work, as is so often the
case in the over-crowded penitentiaries to-day.
This program would include restoration of land that
has become an eye-sore, soil conservation, the return
of some of the natural beauty to the scenic areas of
Pennsylvania, rehabilitation which includes doing
away with the type of prison work that destroys a
man’s initiative, such as being handed a broom and
a can of brass polish when starting a 5, 10, or 20
year sentence, because there is nothing better to of-
fer. It will lessen the chances of returning cell-
shocked inmates to the free world as the migraine of
free society, and last but not least, it will lessen the
tax payer’s burden. Condemning the offender to
useless toil is defeating the main points of the reha-
bilitator’s objectives. You cannot expect any man
to work with a broom, mop, or can of brass polish
a few minutes a day for X amount of years, and have
him return to a free society ready for acceptance in
free labor or anything else. True, the initial cost of
this extended work program would be considerable,
but the long range results would surely justify the

means.

The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania has in its
possession, in its many and varied departments, the
necessary equipment and any number of trucks, bull-
dozers, tractors, etc., required for this type of work.
In addition, our correctional institutions in the State
are over-flowing with wasted man-power that could
be put to good use in this extended program of com-
plete productive labor. Waiting and wasting in
idleness are professional truck drivers, bulldozer
operators, tractor and trailer men and the machinist
to keep this equipment in good running order and
repair. Many of whom are acquainted with the
latest and most efficient operational techniques that

are available.

t the present time the Com-~
monwealth has an in-
mate mobile forestry unit
in operation in the West-
ern part of the State.

stead of punishment, as is the policy of progressive
penal authorities to-day.

It is not unreasonable to assume that this pro-
posed program, with a little help from the right di-
rection and a little effort from all who are concerned,
could be successful within the limits of its potential.

ertain observations appear to
be significant; for one, it
would keep the inmate from
vegetating and being sold
short and then released with
such tragic results of recidi-
vism. Mention has’ been
made that the initial cost of
this type program would be
considerable; however, by the same token it would
not be unreasonable or excessive. The revenue
from increased tourist trade throughout the scenic
routes of Pennsylvania that are now being avoided
due to the complete barrenness of the strip mining
operations, would again show a considerable in-
crease in revenue, if these areas were to be restored
at least partially, to their once natural beauty.

These same scenic areas, which once were ihe
locations for camp sites, hunting lodges, and a haven
for nature lovers and family picnics, which the
hunter and sportsman once found akin to paradise
for their hunting and fishing, but are now a no man’s-
land of nuclear-like destruction, would again be
echoing the sounds of the outdoorsman. The rev-
enue from these returning sporting activities, gas
stations, motels, etc., would increase until this initial
program cost could become a lucrative investment in
lives as well as State revenue.

It may have already occurred to you that the
significant observations mentioned have been raised
for consideration, yet they were not probed too
deeply. This is but a means of gently reminding you,
the reader into giving some thought about your place
in the realm of Rehabilitation - via - Conservation.
Here is the place where prison psychology or psy~-
chiatry alone falls short — It cannot work by itself.
Adult responsibilities, the need to build character
through work, are prime requisites for the penned-up
inmate. One of the most important ingredients lack-
ing is the realization that inmate labor can help.
(Private industry has recognized this fact long ago.)

Something should be done; perhaps this sug-
gestion could be a springboard for some thought or
consideration. We hope that this suggestion will not
