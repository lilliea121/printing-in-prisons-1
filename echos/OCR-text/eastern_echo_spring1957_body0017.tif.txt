deep into his lungs. Then the young man pursed his
lips and whistled his nameless tune.

The elevator opened. She wasn’t too tall. Just
the right height and beautifully proportioned beneath
her form fitting business suit. Jet black hair curled
over her forehead and added brilliance to her green-
ish grey eyes.

Her mouth had a perpetually pouting look but as
her eyes met the young man’s gaze, she smiled slightly.

““Miss Wable?’’ he asked, and smiled in return.

“‘You’re as pretty as Bill said you were. I’m
Bob Hawks.’’

Naney Wable tilted her head slightly and quick-
ly appraised his tall broadness, his curly black hair,
and especially his steady grey eyes with the laugh
wrinkles creasing their edges.

“How do you do,’’ she said as she held out her
tiny gloved hand.

Evidently she liked his appearance.

“Tg there any place in particular you’d care to
eat?’’ the young man asked.

‘“There’s a small Italian restaurant just down
the block. It’s quiet and they serve wonderful food,’’
she suggested, and then added, ‘‘Sound all right?’’

‘‘Hine. I always did like Italian food. Shall
we go?”’

The young man opened the door and they stepped
into the swirling rush of humanity that was New
York at lunch time.

As they dodged through the pushing crowd it
was impossible to speak but Nancy became increas-
ingly aware of his nearness. She liked the hard firm-
ness of his hand resting lightly on her arm and his
clean leather-like smell of soap and tobacco.

Her heart beat faster and Nancy knew it wasn’t
entirely caused by lunch time rush.

The restaurant was one of those quaint Italian
replicas that dot the cities. Checkered table cloths
and a roving violinist. .

It wasn’t too crowded and they seated themselves
at a table for two, nestled in a corner.

‘Some crowd out there,’’ the young man laugh-
ed. ‘‘Is it always like this?’’

“‘Not always. Just twenty-two hours a day,’’
Nancy laughed.

A waiter hurried over and after taking their
orders returned to the hidden confines of the kitchen.

‘‘You say you are a friend of Bill’s?’’ Naney
asked.

“Ves. We were roommates at Southern. I asked
if it would be all right to call if I ever got to New
York. Bill said he thought it would. So here I am.
And do you want to know something?’’ the young
man asked.

EASTERN EcHo

‘“What?’’ Naney asked, playing the game.

‘‘T’m glad, real glad,’’ he said.

Their eyes met and held for a moment, then the
girl averted her gaze slightly and toyed with her
napkin. I’m giad, too, she thought, but asked in-
stead, ‘‘Are you going to be in New York long, Mister
Hawks ?”’

‘‘Just for today. I flew up on business but I’ve
got to be back in Port Jarvis tonight. But,’’ he
added hastily, ‘‘I’ll be back in three or four weeks.
Maybe we could take in a show or two and do a
little dancing. Would you mind if I called then?’’

“*T think I’d like it,’? Nancy replied softly.

The waiter returned with their orders and as
they ate they discovered how similar their likes and
dishkes were.

‘*Oh, I’ve got to get back to the office,’’ Nancy
exclaimed suddenly as she glanced at her watch.
“It’s after two.’’

The young man caught the waiter’s eye and
reached for his wallet.

‘*Will there be anything else, sir?’’ the waiter
asked.

‘‘Our check, please,’’ the young man replied,
and as the waiter departed a worried frown creased
his face. Quickly he groped deeper for his wallet.
His hand hurriedly searched his other pockets.

‘“What is it?’’ Nancy asked as she realized some-
thing was wrong.

ey wallet == . = ltrs gone!

The waiter returned and tendered their check on
a small silver tray.

Nancy studied the embarrassed look of disbelief
written so plainly on his face and then she cautiously
extracted a bill from her purse and pressed it into
his hand beneath the table.

The waiter coughed discreetly and then the
young man placed the bill on the tray.

‘“Thank you, sir,’’ the waiter said as he hurried
away to pay the cashier.

The young man turned to the girl. “‘I...I’m
terribly sorry. I feel like a fool. I... don’t know
what to say. I must have lost my wallet somewhere.”’
And then, as if not willing to accept the fact, he be-
gan to search his pockets again.

“Tt could happen to anyone,’’ the girl replied
sympathetically.

“But... - but 1. 2 the very, first time ive
met you. I wanted to make a good impression.’’

‘You have,’’ Nancy replied and then added,
‘“We’d better go now.’’

_ As they started to rise the young man abruptly
sat down again. ‘‘Oh, no!’’ he exclaimed,

Quickly the girl sat down. ‘‘What’s the matter?
Are you sick?’’ she asked.
