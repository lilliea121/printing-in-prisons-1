CHESS
NEWS

by Martin J. Pearson

This article is dedicated to those
members of the ESP Chess Club
who form the backbone of the Club.
We give a brief resume of their
chess careers and a sample of
their play.

James Ryder joined the club in
1962, barely knowing the names of
the pieces, let alone the moves.
Through diligence in study and
practice he gradually rose from the
bottom of the rating list to a
coveted position in the top ten.

Ryder has played in the Reserve
section and last season played
three games in the Championship
section, scoring two victories
against one defeat. He has won
several awards for outstanding
performance in the Club Cham-
pionship Tournaments and for
outstanding play against visiting
clubs.

Lately, it has become evident
that there is a serious defect in
his middle and end game and
he presently is taking the neces-
sary step to correct them.

His game against Andrew
Chressanthis (U.S.C.F. Expert)
ranks as the high spot in his
young career.

Editor, Chess News —
The Eastern Echo

: On behalf of the officers and members of the Phila, Chess Assn. I wish
to take this opportunity to congratulate the present and past personnel of the
_ Eastern Echo on its tenth anniversary. I also extend congratulations to the
: oy management of SCIPHA for their continued encouragement of this fine pub-
lication. : . 8

: _ During the eight years I have been a reader of the Echo, I have been
continually pleased with the type of material presented, and the talent of the
many writers of the various articles published. Of course, being a "chess nut"
one of my favorite pages is Chess News by Martin J. Pearson, This is another
example of accurate reporting, general throughout the entire magazine. :

I feel that the quality of the Echo is a reflection of the type of
person who will eventually be given another chance to resume the responsibility
of good citizenship. © : : :

i have been a guest of the ESP Chess Club on many occasions, and feel :
that I have never expressed my appreciation for what you contribute to the
chess commmity of Phila. First by being a perfect host to the various chess
clubs who match wits with you each year. Second by your continued display of
good sportmanship at each contest you play. Third by the type of players you
have been losing to the rest of the league, and I know that hurts ESP, but you

wouldn't have it any different. To the best of my knowledge these players trans-
ferring to other clubs are rarely returned to you.

The Eastern Echo is doing a good job in Public Relations by promoting a

_ better understanding between the community and the man who has been given another

_ chance to make good,

Happy Tenth Birthday,

Rearend
