true to his belief, it has come to pass, so be it.

The high flying Falcon’s of the Cuban League has

been leading the league ever since the first of May,
and dosen’t seem to relinquish their lead thus far.
They have been kicking dust in the faces of the
Braves, Giants and Detroit. There have been no
stagger jobs or gift games for the Falcons as they
ripped into opposing pitchers with such telling effect
that the ““Birds’’ will fly even higher before the first
half is over. Will the “Birds” story have a happier
ending than the last two years? There is much ev-
idence that it will, and it keeps piling up, game after
game, as they continue to win on genuine skill. They

haven't been backing in.

The Falcon’s infield is more polished and steadier
than ever before. With such stalwart players as,
Shep, Fred, Greenie and Zietz the job will be done
in fine style. They have been throwing to the right

bases and making the cutoff plays as never before.

They have been running the bases more recklessly |

than ever before but escaping with a minimum of
mistakes and penalties. The outfield is amply pa-

trolled by the great all around player, Sonny Mays,

Eastern Echo

The battery of the fab-
ulous pitcher, “No No” and Frantic Johnny doing
the catching chores has kept the “Birds” flying be-
yond any doubt.

Art, Norman and Pigmeat.

Thus, just about every man in the regular lineup
jumped into the breach at one time or another and
cut enough capers at the plate to keep the Falcons on
a winning keel. G.I. Joe’s ‘Birds’ have displayed
all the skill in the early stages that could be asked of
a champion and additionally they have acquired a
togetherness —- we don’t like this word but can’t
find a better one to fit them, unless we say they have
become a ‘character club’. Another factor is,
when a player slumps momentarily, someone else is
right there to pick him up. Also early indications
point to just about every Falcon having his best year

or one of his better ones.

Now it all adds up to whether they will continue to
hold the team spirit to match their superb play. Its
up to G.I. Joe and Norman, to keep it alive.

Footnote: The Falcons won the first half going

away, with the record of 27 wins and only 7 in the
lost column.

My predictions of the Braves winding up in third
place came to be. They got off to a faulty start dur-
ing the first half and never appeared to untrack
themselves from the rut they were in. On paper and
word of mouth they were the team to beat out for the
pennant—they never got themselves together in
order to become the Big Bad Braves as their manager
so called them. They collapsed afield like a wound-
ed warrior in battle and the wounds they received
from the opposing clubs crimped any sustained drive
they may have had in mind. Judging from their
roster they have good power at the plate with Big
Mack, Lou McCloud, Hassa Johnson and Bob John-
son would indicate they had no problems to speak
of. When the big sticks are on strike the power hitters
are no longer a threat to the opposition. Their neme-
sis, the Falcons clashed all their hopes of ever win-
ning the flag this first half—and it will be the same in
the second half as well. They have a great speed ball
