and this God damned, bearded fool has to louse it
up. Damn you!” she wailed. “Damn you! Damn
you!”

She settled back on the bunk then, with her
eyes tightly closed, clinching her hands into hard
little fists until her knuckel whitened and the cords
stood out in her neck. She didn’t weep or cry out,
but big wet tears forced themselves out of her
clamped eyelids. Whether from pain or grief or
self pity I did not know, but I did know that | had
her to the point where I| could save her if I handled
the situation correctly. To console her now, or to
encourage her remorse, might very well capitulate
to the lethargic state of pending death. So, throw-
ing out all the stops, | lowered the boom and gave
it to her with everything I| had.

‘Look here, you!’’ I snapped. “Just who in the
hell do you think you are to harp at me? I didn’t
invite you to flap out in my back yard. But you
did, and the way I look at it, I’ve got to do what I
can for you. Now, you're pretty well busted up
and it’s going to take quite a while for you to get
around on your own again. So, you'd better make
up your mind that you re going to have to spend the
winter right here, in this cabin with me.”

She opened her eyes and gave me a quizzical
stare, and when she raised herself up to make a
retort, I lit into her again. “And you can take that
dirty, offended look off your face, lady. 1 may be
the bearded fool you think that | am, but I’m not to
the stage yet where I go around raping idiotic wo-
men that cripple themselves up in plane crashes.
Now I know you have some problems or you
wouldn't be here, but you can just keep them to
yourself while you're here. All 1 want from you is
to be civil, and get well as quick as possible, so |
can take you out of here by next spring or summer.
And then, I don’t give a tinker’s damn what you do
with yourself. Just keep your plane out of my
woods the next time you try one of your crazy
stunts, will you?”

Her eyes were wide now, and clear. She hesi-
tated for a few moments, studying me intently, and
then she asked almost respectfully, “Is that the way
it's going to be>?”’

“That's the way it’s got to be,” I answered.
“This is my home and I don’t want your dead body
around here. Do you understand?”

“Yes,’’ she replied. “I savvy. You say it’s
your place, so we'll play it by your rules, until I can
make it on my own. I'll buy that for a while. And
now that we're going to be such cozy roomates for
at least nine months I might as well introduce my-
self. My name is Sybil Webster. What's yours?”’

“Bright,” I said. “Keith Bright.”

“Well now,’ she said facetiously, reverting
back to her acid tone of a few minutes previously.
“Aren't you the bright one?”’

“Yes I am,’ I answered. A little rankled, but
still relieved that my weak, psychic strategy had
worked so well.

The months that followed were most vexing,
the most curious, and finally the most pleasant times
that I had ever known. At first Sybil was open-
ly defiant of all my attempts to help her during her
confinement and fiercely berated me when | had to
work on her injuries and assist her with her personal
necessities. She cursed me as a sadist, a quack, a
crazy hermit and a sex degenerate, among other
things. And I in turn, sticking to my original strate-
gy, gave a few choice adjectives right back to her.

Later on, when her insults became time worn
and ineffective, she refrained from her belittling
line and merely questioned me about the cabin, the
woods, and Bo, or about my functions with it all.
But never once did she inquire about my past, or
question the reasons for my living out here. | didn’t
know whether to attribute her lack of interest to
just plain indifference, or to a feeling of respect for
my privacy. By the same token, neither did I prod
into her past, although in all honesty I was extremely
curious as to what would drive this young woman
to attempt self distruction. There was a haunting
clue in her delirious outburst while she was uncon-
scious, and my avid imagination offered a thousand
solutions to those few words, but I would never
really know their meaning unless she voluntered to
tell me about it, because I knew I would never

ask her.

In the beginning it was mildly embarassing to
both of us, because of her constant nagging, when I
had to expose parts of her body to bathe or attend
her injuries. But even that procedure was ultimately
hidden behind a facade of polite formalities, and
the two of us bluffed our roles perfectly. Although
I must admit, toward the end of the several weeks
of my close attention to her, I found Sybil’s nearness
disturbing. She began to look like a woman again,
as the ravages of her grave condition disappeared,
along with the cuts and bruises. Later on, when she
was able to sit up in a chair, she betrayed her de-
light at the skimpy, revealing buckskin dress | had
made for her during her long inactivity. I had fash-
ioned and sewn the dress with all good intentions,
but my newly tried handiwork fell short of my ex-
