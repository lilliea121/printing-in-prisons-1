mom’s titanic letter and rushes up to the block
hack’s desk, screaming, ‘“Where’s Stella? What did
you do with Stella?”

He sez, “Take it easy, Bilkowskivic,” and I can
see the knuckles on his hand whiten as he grips the
edge of the desk. He’s thinking I’m snapping out,
but he don’t wanna blow the whistle unless he’s sure,
I don’t give him the chance to make sure, because I
run off the block to the Captain’s Office and bump
into Lootenant Krisp, just outside the door.

He grabs my arm and sez, “Take it easy, Bilkow-
skovic. Where’s the fire?”

I said, ‘“Stella’s missing! I want to see Captain
Albright.”

He said, ‘““Who’s Stella, and what’s that?” Point-
ing to mom’s floppy letter.

I said, “Mom sent me Stella’s picture in this letter,
but it ain’t here.”

He said, “Is that a letter, no kidding?”

I said, “Yea, and Stella ain’t here.” And just then
the Captain comes out.

He sez, “What are you doing here, Bilkowskovic?
And what’s that thing?”

I said, “Stella’s missing from Mom’s letter, here.”

He sez, “Is that a letter, no kidding? It looks like
a road map!”

Just then Major Brandt walks up and sez, ““What’s
going on here, and what’s that thing?”

I explained about Stella’s picture and everything
and he sez, “Is that a letter, no kidding?” Then he
said, ‘““We’ll have to take it up with the mail room to-
morrow.”

“I want Stella now,” I wailed. “I waited 4% years
for Stella and I want her now!”

“Look Zave,” he said. He used my first name but ©

he didn’t sound to friendly. “You knock this crap
off and go back to your block.”

I started back to the block and then shot off the
main corridor towards the mail room. On the way
I bumped into a working buddy from the brick gang.
He grabbed my arm and said, “Hey, where ya goin’,
Zave? It’s check time already.”

I said, “Leggo, I gotta find Stella!”

He looked at me funny and sez, “For a minute
there I thought you said, ‘I gotta find Stella”.

I said, “Go to hell!” and pulled my arm free. But
I had to go back to the cell block anyway, cause my
buddy told me everyone down front went home al-
ready. When I got back to the block the hack sez,
“Where the hell’ve you been Bilkowskovie? I’m try-
ing to make count. Get in your eell!”

I said, “Go to hell,” and jumped in my eell. The
hack snapped the lock on me and said, “That’ll cost
ya, Bilkowskovic. ’m writin’ a misconduct on ya!”

At that point I didn’t care, so I sat down on the
edge of my bunk to mope and finish the rest of
mom’s big letter. She goes on-to say...

“Gf you don’t mind her three kids, because
she likes them quite’a bit. Theyre nice look-
ing kids, but they don’t look alike. I think
youll like them anyway, Francis Xavier.
Even if none of them looks like you. Stella
all reddy wrote and ast to go on your mail-
ing list, so good luck to you, my dear son.

— 24

So much love to you from your dearly be-

loved mother.

Yours truly,
Mom

I laid mom’s letter down with mixed emotions and
started to roll another ‘Billy the Kid’ when the thin
cigarette paper slipped out of my hand and fluttered
under my bunk. I got down on all fours and hunted
for it. The light was dim and I’m groping for it way
underneath, when my fingers bumped into a piece of
hard, curved paper. My hand trembled as I straight-
ened up and turned the paper over. It was Stella!
Holy Toledo!

She leaped out at me from the glossy print, and
her voluptuousness surrounded me with a warm feel-
ing. I had found the picture that wasn’t even lost.
Gad, those Bikinis are something! Or nothing, which-
ever way you look at them. And mom was right.
Stella is a looker, that’s for sure. And what a shape!
Wow!

I called the block hack over and said, “I found
Stella under the bed and I’m sorry I popped off at
Ya. Do you want to see her?”

He gives me this funny look and sez, “That’s O.K.
Bilkowskovie. I didn’t write you up yet, anyhow.”
Then he takes the picture and looks at it and his
Adam’s apple jumps up and down. “Wow!” he
croaks, ‘She sure is some looker, ain’t she?”

That night I stay in my eell and wrote a letter to
mom instead of going to the movie. Who wants to
see a crummy movie with Stella around. I said...

Dear Mon,

I received your letter and the picture of
Stella, and you’re right, mom. She sure is a
looker. You be sure and tell her right away
I’m glad she wants to write to me, and I
think she sure is a looker. Tell her I don’t
care about the 3 kids. None of us is perfect,
you know. You be sure and tell her that.

Mon, you gotta straten papa out. He had

13 jobs last year and 9 jobs already this
year. You tell him I said, “Straten up,
papa, or [ll whack your tail a good one
when I get out.” And tell Pauline I said to
put on a long skirt and go back to school,
and to stop sucker punching the teachers,
or she’ll end up a bum. There’s enough
bums in the family already. You tell her I
said so, or I’ll whack her tail a good one
when I get out. I don’t want her in the fact-
ory with that Sauerwein, either. Do you
hear? I know a few things about Moe, and
it ain’t all just pinching legs, either.
Well, mom there ain’t too much to write
about in this place, so I’ll close this letter
by telling you to tell Stella what I told you
to tell her. She sure is a looker, mom. I
grant you that, alright.

Your loving son,
Francis Xavier Bilkowskovic

P.S. No, mom. They don’t have no chawk-
let covered crickets here...
