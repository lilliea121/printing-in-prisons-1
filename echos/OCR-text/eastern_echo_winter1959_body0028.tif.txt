SEX AND THE PRISONER

or A, GOOD TITLE IS ITAARD TO FIND

2 #2

Was the above title provocative enough to make
you start reading this? Well, that’s one of the func-
tions of a title. But you can stop reading now. This
is not about sex and/or the prisoner. It is about ti-
tles, a subject less fascinating than sex perhaps, but
ane which I know considerably more about.

It takes as much talent, of a sort, to write a
‘“block-busting” title as it does to write the story that
goes with it. The value of the just-right title can be
shown by the fact that a movie studio once offered
Tennessee Williams ten thousand dollars just to
write a title for one of their movies. With such tags
as CUNT ON JA IBIOME WIN IRQOIR aiacl ak Skee akc eee
NAMED DESIRE to his eredit, he is considered one
of the major titlists around today.

Of course, one of the important rules of the game
is that a title must have some connection with the
story. Otherwise, it is a very definite foul (and it
would take a Univae to count the number of fouls
committed). The more fitting a title is, the higher
its prestige and rating. One of the best in recent
years was by Polly Adler, the famed Madam, who
used this saying as the title for her biography: A
HOUSE IS NOD A HOME. And since, no matter
how often they were frequented, her houses were
certainly not homes, the title not only properly fit
the story, it also produced howls all over the country,
as well as jingling cash registers,

Another highly intriguing title consisted of only
one word—well, not exactly a word, but rather, a
sound. For that sound heard round-the-world, let’s
°o now to Hollywood: The studio powers were going
over a new film in the proverbial smoke-filled (but
elaborate) office, when a writer began describing
tlhe stormy to tlie Iie Mem, “Mang,” Ine seid, “is wae
story of a marriage that goes phffft and the wife. .”
He was interrupted by the Big Man, who removed his
cigar long enough to exclaim, “A great story idea,
boy, and that's just what we ll call it!”

The writer quickly tried to recall what he’d just
said. “Oh, you mean we should call it THE STORY
OF A MARRIAGE?” he asked.

“No, you idiot!” Whe Big Man had arisen now
and announced: “We'll call it PHF FFT, with 3 fs.”

He turned his back and walked to the picture win-
dow, giving this revolutionary idea time to penetrate.
He then turned to grect the stunned, silent faces with
his second bomb-shell. “We’ve got this new girl on
the lot who’ll be perfect doing it,” looking supremely
satisfied.

The others looked at one another, now more puz-
zled than ever. The director, sure that the Big Man
was sick, was the first to speak: “But, Mr. Cohn,” he
said soothingly, “Judy Holliday is already signed to
do this picture.”

The Big Man looked at him with contempt and
roared, “Who’s talking about the picture? I’m talk-
ing about the title! We'll need a girl to say it! As
the title flashes on the screen, this gorgeous doll

turned to his secretary, “What is that new girl’s
name, anyway?” The secretary checked rapidly
down @ list, then answered, Kam Nowak”

Neal,” Ine Sancl, “aes we ome, We moneslart
even give her a build-up.”

So, this film not only launched a most unusual ti-
tle, it gave Kim Novak a pretty good send-off too.

While in Hollyood, let’s go over to Universal.
This studio had a big property and decided to
splurge—all the way. The costliest film they’d ever
made. The picture, amid proper fanfare opened in
New York. It was A TIME TO LOVE AND A TIME
TO DIE ( Now, mind you, nine word titles are rather
rare). It began rapidly to lay a four million dollar
ege. In desperation, Hollywood called New York.
“The title is too long,” they moaned, “and besides,
this is a war drama. Change it to A TIME TO DIE.”
New York complied. Business dipped even lower.
Another call from Hollywood: “People don’t want
war now. They want love. Change it to A TIME
TO LOVE.” New York again complied. Business
didn’t dive any lower (it couldn’t), but it didn’t rise
either. Im the last of the calls, New York finally
spoke up: “‘Let’s face facts, we’ve got a little stinker
on our hands.”

Hollywood said, “No, no, youre wrong. ‘This,
whatever else you may choose to call it, is no little
stinker. Hold the phone a minute.”

New York heard Hollywood saying to his sec-
