HAPPINESS IS JUST A DOG CALLED

Any other dog would be content to be just a dog,
but not Snoopy. If you follow his exploits in the
‘‘Peanuts’’ strip (Evening Bulletin), you know that
he suffers from delusions. Not delusions of gran-
deur, exactly, but . . . delusions of crocodile, de-
lusions of lion, delusions of boa constrictor. We like
him, anyhow; and because we like him, we gave

Snoopy this column to do for the ECHO.

At 7:00 A.M., the morning of Friday, November
30th last, a small group of Officers and inmates (and
Snoopy) gathered together in the Ice Plant to bid
a surprise farewell to the man who in 1952 was
responsible for the complete changeover from D.C.
to A.C. current in this institution. A cake lay on
the table, and on that cake service candles were al-
lowed to burn down and etch the figure 21, for it
was on August 6, 1935, that this man first came to
work here.

The person retiring was a large, somewhat
stooped man whose vocational record is interesting
in that since 1921 he has held but two jobs: 14
years with Western Electric, followed, of course,
by the 21 years at Eastern. Prior to these were two
hitches with the U. 8S. Army and one (during
W.W.1I) with the U.S. Navy.

Asked about his reason for retiring, the big
guy replied: “‘I’m like the voters in 1952—I had
enough. It’s time for a change after 21 years in one
place.’’

That man? Chief Electrician Elbert Murphy.
The men who knew him and liked him wish him good
luck and continued success.

SNOOPY IS A SECONDNIGHTER ca |

Some kind of an Admiration Society should be
formed in honour of those men who put on the show
of December 26th. This was the second staging
of the VARIETY CHRISTMAS SHOW which had
played to a full house but two days before. Only
this was different, real different.

At the last moment, and due to circumstances
beyond control, the genial M. C. of the show, not to
mention two big acts—cancelled out. BUT THE
SHOW WENT ON IN THE TRADITION OF SHOW

SNOOPY SEZ GOOD-BYE

SNOOPY

By Robert D. Heinemann

BIZ. Johnny ‘‘Ginoots’’ Greco, nothing daunted,
assumed the duties of M. C. Off the cuff, with no
notes to guide him, with nothing to fall back upon
but the little guy’s courage and showmanship.
Surprising, and that is the word for it, was Ginoots’
singing of ‘‘Sorrento”’... also a voice dis guy has!

Slick Matthews played a fine guitar solo and
lightly danced his way through a pleasing number.
Chico came from the audience to the stage for two
demonstrations which proved that I still don’t know
how he took his shirt off without pulling his arms
out of the sleeves, and also that some people have
steel girders built into their ears . . . which Big
Ralph found out to his dismay. Audience partici-
pant Lou Biancone, was another off the cuffer who
proved what can be done on the spur of the moment
and under pressure. His was not only entertaining
patter, but was prefaced with some . . . sobering
remarks.

Real pros, and they looked it and played like it,
were the eight members of the Dixieland Band:
Hooks, piano; Bill Schoonmaker, drums; Bish, bass
fiddle; Makin, clarinet; Slick Matthews, guitar;
E. P. Brown, trombone; Joe F., trumpet; and Larue,
tenor sax.

SNOOPY GOES WELDING nce

A communication from erstwhile crack peteman,
Charles W. Bowes (former C-9032), brings several
bits of good news to light. Many of us remember
Charlie, an openfaced guy with a good sense of
humor and a lengthy criminal history. Many of us
also know that for years Charlie has been con-
founding all those who say such things just don’t
happen by becoming slowly, surely and solidly one
big successful citizen. Owning his own home, hap-
pily married, commuted from parole in 1953 after
an outstanding parole adjustment, Charlie is present-
ly working at his Steamfitting and Welding trade
like the true veteran that he is. On a weekly
Employee’s Statement of Earnings and Deductions
that Snoopy has, it reads for ‘‘C. Bowes: Total
Hours, 40; Gross Pay $160.00; Deductions, ete.;
Net Ray, SIO OE

Sez Charlie, ‘‘If Bowes can win, so can you,
also. Unions today will recognize all ex-cons if they
learn a good trade in jail.”’
