ROBERT HEINEMANN: Editor Emeritus AX

It was with deep regret that the Editorial Staff
of the ‘‘Hcho’’ accepted the resignation of EDITOR
BOBBY HEINEMANN. BOBBY has been with the
‘‘Hcho’’ since its birth, two years ago . Through
numerous disappointments, and with tender patience
and perseverance BOBBY helped bring ‘‘Hcho’’ to
a position of honor among the Penal Press . .
BOBBY’S absence will be felt acutely, and many
readers of our magazine will be saddened by his
resignation.

Eastern Echo took great pride in the articles,
editorials and stories of BOBBY ... Hach had a
message, each had a moral and will remain forever
in our minds.

Although it is a great loss to Eastern Echo, and
its subscribers, the free world will gain a new and
better BOBBY HEINEMANN.

SNOOPY FINDS OUT: Hank ‘‘The Tank’’

SNOOPY has always wondered why Hank Myers
appears at work every Tuesday afternoon looking
as though he has just stepped out of a fashion
plate... Well... SNOOPY snooped, and came up
with the answer. Tuesday is the day Hank’s sister
visits him. What makes a man more presentable to
those who visit him than a clean, close shave, hair
well groomed and a nice pressed shirt. With his
contagious laugh and smile, Mickey has a pretty sharp
brother... Of course the few gray hairs on the side

help, also.

To all those who are leaving us via parole,
SNOOPY extends his paw and says, ‘‘Look forward
to the coming years with confidence in yourselves
and the confidence of those you leave behind, we
will be following your course . . .The future will
not be without difficulties but with faith in your-

selves and the strength of free men you shall gain
your objectives.”’

SNOOPY SALUTES:

Louis Straccioni - =

Why is it that the good works of men remain
untold? In the last issue of Hecho, we learned of
Big Jim Ford, a man who has a heart as big as his
name. How many of us know Lows Straccion? .. .
I mean really know him? ... Here is a man whom
we see every day, and yet, I’ll wager there aren’t
a half dozen know that he has a heart of gold where
others are concerned.

SNOOPY heard of a family that would have had
no Thanksgiving or Christmas. Through some un-
known source Lows Straccion learned of the hard-
ship that surrounded this family ... Quietly, and
without fanfare, he mentioned this fact to his good
friend Reverend Anthony Vasquez, of St. John’s
Baptist Church. Reverend Vasquez and his group
of friends made it a happy Thanksgiving and
Christmas for a wife and two children .. .

It is said that Midge learned his art from ‘‘The
Barber of Seville’? . . . Mike Smith, virtually a

Mike says,‘The best way to look like you’ve lost
weight is to wear loose clothes.’’... Low (Brooklyn

Vinnie Coladeonato, deep in thought over a mathe-
matical problem ... Leo McMahon, giving a testi-
monial in honor of a fine lady, Mrs. Dorothy Scheer,
did so with all the dignity of a real toastmaster.. . .
Henry Saby: The only thing wrong that I find with
psychiatry is that the solution of one problem simply
leads to the evolution of another problem ... Over-
heard while padding past the dental office, ‘‘You’ll
wonder where the yeller went when you brush your
teeth with wet cement.”” .. . Jesse Young: People
are always asking me how I find happiness. It’s
