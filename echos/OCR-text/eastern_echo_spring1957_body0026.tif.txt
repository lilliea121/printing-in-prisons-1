So, you’ve come to the tropics,

Heard all you had to do—

Was sit in the shade of a cocoanut glade
While the dollars roll in to you.

They told you that at the bureau?
Did you get the statistics all straight?
Well, hear what it did to another kid,
Before you decide your fate.

You don’t go down with a hard, short fall
You just sort of shuffle along,

And loosen your load of the moral code,
Till you can’t tell the right from the wrong.

I started out to be honest,

With everything on the square,

But a man can’t fool with the Golden Rule,
In a crowd that won’t play fair.

T’was a case of riding a dirty race,
Or being an also-ran;

My only hope was to steal and dope
The horse of another man.

I pulled a deal at Guayaquil

In an Inea silver mine,

But before they found it was salted ground
I was safe in the Argentine.

I made short weight on the River Platte,
When runnning a freighter there;
And I cracked a crib on a rich estate
Without even turning a hair.

But the deal that will everlastingly bar my soul,
When it knocks at Heaven’s doors,

Was peddling booze in the Santa Cruz,

And Winchester forty-fours.

Made unafraid by my kindly aid,

The drunk-crazed brutes calmed down.
To leave in a shivering, blazing mass. . .
A flourishing border town.

I was next in charge of a smuggler’s barge,
Off the coast of Yucatan,

But she sank to hell off Cozonel,

One night in a hurricane.

I got to shore on a broken oar,

In the filthy, shrieking dark;

With the other two of the good ship’s crew,
Converted into shark.

From a limestone cliff I flagged a skiff,
With a pair of salt-soaked jeans,

And I worked my way, for I couldn’t pay,
On a fruiter to New Orleans.

It’s kind of a habit, the tropics;

It gets you worse than rum,

You'll get away and swear you'll stay,
But it calls and back you come.

Six years went by

Before I was back on the job,
Running a war in Salvador,
With a black-faced, barefooted mob.
