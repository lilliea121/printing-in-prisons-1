convict—and give little or no accountable thought of
the whole convict man. It is equally unfortunate that
many convicts use this same dubious thought process
when considering warden, judge, cops, and yes, the
‘honest John’’ never having police troubles.

As convicts we urge the non-convict to be more
understanding toward us, to ask himself about the
lines he has drawn between us, to remember that each
of us is a unique human being. We are right in

demanding this consideration from our fellow man.

It is no less proper, and our duty, to examine the
lines we as convicts draw between our very same fel-
low man; the non-convict. Let us not have our lines
form non-sense maps... after all, the part of so-
ciety all of us want to join, has been visited by
us before.

The Negro Problem ?

by Robert A. Payne

By a peculiar logical inversion the Anglo-Saxon
class, its imitators, accomplices and victims have
been led to believe in a so-called “Negro Problem.”
The truth of the matter is that there is actually no
“Negro Problem”; for the Negro’s Problem, and in-
deed the problem of the world today, is the “Cauca-
sian Problem,”

A continuous reference to a “Negro Problem” as-
sumes the proposition that some profound and sin-
ister difficulty has been or is being created for the
rest of humanity by the so-called Negroes. This is
typical ruling class arrogance and duplicity, and has
no validity or basis in fact. It has been centuries
since any Negro (African) Nation has menaced the
rest of humanity. The last of the Black Moors with-
drew from Europe in 1492. I personally cannot re-
call reading anywhere in the annals of history where
these Blacks passed any Jim Crow laws, set up any
white (European) ghettos, conducted any mass po-
groms or carried on any discriminatory practices
against whites. Nor did they devote centuries of sys-
tematic propaganda, invariably malicious and erron-
eous, to prove the superiority of their blackness over
their white counterparts (Brethern).

Eastern HEcho/January, 1967

So, while we may dismiss the concept of a ‘““Negro
Problem” as a valuable dividend-paying fiction, it is
vividly clear that there is a “Caucasian Problem”. . .
a problem that is poignantly real and practically
universal.

Stated candidly, the problem confronting the
Negroes and indeed the colored peoples of the world,
is how to live in freedom, peace, security and segre-
gation without being invaded, subjugated, exploited,
expropriated, persecuted, humiliated and generally
bereft of all God given means of self elevation, in-
dividuality and human dignity by the whites (Cau-
casians). The same whites who justify their actions
by the ‘Myth’ of bringing salvation to the so-called
black or colored heathens in the name of Jesus
Christ.

The so-called Negro Problem is thus as mythical
as the term ‘Negro” itself, and is as false as the
white mans justifications! I say it is time that we
recognize “The Problem” for what it is and who it
is! We have passed through the ‘Age of Reason,’
now let us recognize the ‘Age of Truth’!

The term ‘Negro’ should be eradicated, for it, too,
is as fictitious as the theory (conception) of white
