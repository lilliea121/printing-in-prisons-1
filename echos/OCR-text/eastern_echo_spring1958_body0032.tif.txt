The news of the transfer of Father Edwin
Gallagher from chaplain of this institution to ad-
ministrator of St. Michael’s Church in Philadelphia,
was sadly received by the many friends he had
made in the six years he had spent here. The men
indicated their high esteem and respect for Father
Gallagher by their gift on the occasion of his de-
parture. The inscription, ‘‘Priest, Friend and Con-
fessor’’, expressed in full their sentiments. To
Father Gallagher we wish success and happiness in
his hew assignment.

How does one react to the appointment as
Chaplain of a Penitentiary? I confess it was with
mixed emotions and many misconstrued notions. I
depicted the men as being resentful, surly and bitter ;
the personne! as overlords with Simon Legree tactics.

These false impressions were dispelled immedi-

ately. I found, to my great satisfaction, that many
displayed a marvelous sense of humor and adjust
to institutional life readily. The big consolation
was the realization of the men that spiritual guid-
ance can be beneficial. The sincerity of those who
attend Mass and devotions regularly was most grati-
fying. However, much is to be desired of those who
refuse the consolation of religion.

The acceptance by the men of the many facili-
ties, provided to improve themselves, by the rehabili-
tation program was most encouraging. The sympa-
thetic understanding of the personnel towards the
men affords harmonious relationships. All in all,
the entire program to develop the “whole man”’,
spiritual, physical and cultural is a credit to the
institution and it is a privilege to be part of it.

During these Lenten days it is well to pitch our
mental tents about the thought of the life principle;
always bearing in mind that fruit is borne—not by
doine—but by dying. When we come to the end of
ourselves—our finite resources—we find the beginning
of God. Our extremity is always God’s opportunity.
The sincere follower of our Lord early discovers
that in the quest of Spiritual power and vitality,
there is something to give up, Something to take up
and someone to follow up. We point you to the
words of our Master: ‘“‘If any man will come after
me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and
follow me!’’

The Bible contains this life principle. A pro-
fessor in one of our large universities held a little
brown seed in his hand. He said to his class, ‘‘I
know just exactly the composition of this seed. It
has in it hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. I can
make a seed exactly like this seed but the seed I
would make and plant lacks what we eall the life
principle. The seed I would make would rot and

endured the cross.’’—St. Paul

die, but the seed God made gives life and reproduces
itself.’’ Let a man read the Bible and it will reach
him where nothing else can or will. Let him study
it and he will be introduced to the heart of God.
Let him ask his questions and he will find his answers.
Let him test the pages and he will experience the
power of God.

Our bodies live by two processes, assimilation
and elimination—taking in and giving out. The
soul grows by the same two methods. Read a pas-
sage of the scriptures—not too many—then stop
and ask this question, ““O God, what is im these
verses that you commend? Is it in my life? If it isn’t,
help me to take it IN now.’’ That is assimilation.
Then, ask this question, ‘‘God, what is in these verses
that you condemn? Are they in my life? If so, help
me to take them OUT now.”’ By the proper use of
these processes we will discover that the life-prin-
ciple will take root, our love for Christ will be-
come more perfect and we will be able to serve
Him more worthily.
