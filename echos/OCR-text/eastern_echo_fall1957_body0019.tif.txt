Joe smiled with pleasure as he listened to his
voice drone on and on until it was slowly interrupted
by the sweet soft music gradually increasing in
volume. Then he hurried across the glass-enclosed

studio .. . took his hat and grey topcoat from their
pegs. He hurried down the shadowed hall toward
the rear entrance and stepped into the fog shrouded

another human being. Satisfied, he quickly covered
the short distance across the empty parking lot to
his car. The motor roared into life and he tooled
the ’53 Buick across the damp concrete .. . without
