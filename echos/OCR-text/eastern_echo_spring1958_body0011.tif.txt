At the present time, Mrs. Jenkins and the children
are being cared for by Mothers’ Assistance.

: In leisure time, Al Jenkins may be found per-
haps in class for those with speech impediments
(his own, a sheht tendency to stammer), perhaps
upon a handball court practicing the game at which
he was, in 1957, singles champion throughout this
institution, known for his tremendous endurance
_ and determination.

W. asked this Navy veteran the why’s and where-
fore’s of his life, the reason for his being here,
for all the family man aspects of his self-improving
drive. At first, our natural skepticism strained his
words by half, but he only laughed good-naturedly
and supplied us with some of that strange proof
which must have flabbergasted police and Judge,
jury, court spectators and investigating Probation
Department teams alike.

‘“Eidna lived across from me,’’ Jenkins began.
‘“We even had a job together. What can I say but
we were just two people who never had a chance and
who met each other and got along.

‘“‘Tt’s true I had an Honorable Discharge from
the Navy, but later came the trouble. I said then
and I say now, I was innocent, but conviction fol-
lowed my first arrest. So because I had once served
time I brought to our marriage a hurtful thing—you
see, I was on parole.

““Edna didn’t mind. Our children came and
didn’t know. But one by one employers always
found me out,—somehow—and let me go. In the
last six months of freedom alone I got and lost 12
jobs, so help me God, as the authorities found out,
for no other reason but being on parole. When I
was out of, work, I tried to get Unemployment Com-
pensation, but was refused because I never held
a job long enough. Between ‘‘steady’’ work, I did
odd jobs to get and keep our rented home together.
We were so much in love, the neighbors liked us, I
worked hard, too—but always the fact of my pa-
rolee status kept, I don’t know, coming up somehow
and I’d be out of work again.

“‘T never really knew how much a man would
take or do for his wife and kids.

‘“The victims said I was a gentleman, but I was
desperate, too. Before I pulled my first holdup, the
lights and gas were cut off, the Constable was put
on me for bills, we cooked on a hot plate because the
eas range we owned was sold to try to get the lights
back on. Our refrigerator, dining and living room
sets were sold to buy food. The kids were patched
and clean, I could stand that. But Edna was preg-
nant again with our fourth child, born the day of
my arrest. And our third, a year old girl, couldn’t
even stand. The doctor said she had not received the
proper food.

“That was the last and worst of all the straws.
I took a paring knife and held up a bill collector.
From then on, whenever I was broke and out of

EASTERN EcHo

work again, I robbed another bill collector. Yes,
a series of them,’’ he smiled. ‘‘ You can see my mind
was really on those bills!”’

‘Eventually I had the lights back on and all
the gas and rent and grocery bills were paid. I
gradually bought sets of furniture, too, before the
police came.’’

How was it that they took so long to catch
this man?

“Well, they were working hard, alright, but
suspected a hoodlum was operating whose m. o. was
to hold up bill collectors only. Special detectives
had been assigned to catch the thief—but they were
frequenting bars and such, looking for their hood to
spend his money. And I was home, and home is
where all the money from the hold-ups went.

‘But a collector finally did identify my face
and I found myself in custody. I refused to sign a
statement till my wife and kids were taken care of—
then I told them everything I did, and why.’’

At this point, Jenkins paused and gazed at us
reflectively.

‘You know,”’ he said, ‘‘and you do know now
for sure, my whole trial was based on the facts that
I only stole when out of work, the extent of my
family’s suffering, and the fact that all the proceeds
went tomy home. If it hadn’t been the way it was,
I think they would have thrown the key away when

' they sentenced me four years ago. As is; I do have

hope that some day I’ll be with my wife and kids
again.’’

In Summing up the train of events from crimes
to trial and sentencing, Jenkins evidenced the kind
of reasoning and attitudes which are so much a part
of him. ;

‘‘T really have some appreciation to give out—a
debt of gratitude I can never pay. To everyone who
helped my wife and myself gain a new hope and
life to work forward to. I mean, to Judge Sporkin,
and it was mostly through the Judge that the state
welfare came in to care for my wife and kids,—to
the police, to the probation people who did the
investigating, to the Church. Even the bill col-
lectors seemed to understand. And the people here,
they helped me, too.

‘“As I say, they checked and got the truth.
And they all know, too, that because of their help,
my wife and I are going to win through and build
our home,—if possible, that chicken farm. They
know where my heart is, and Edna’s. And we’ve
just got to come through.”’

As we of ECHO observe this sturdy young
father follow his star even amid the confusion and
separation of imprisonment, somehow we, too, with
the authorities, not least of which our Superin-
tendent here, beheve that Alphonso Jenkins and his
wife will indeed do just that .. . come through, and
earn the right to make their dreams come true. ==
