Systems of
Penal Labor

THE CONTRACT OR PIECE-PRICE SYSTEM

Aside from agriculture, there have been six dif-
ferent systems by which prisoners have been employ-
ed. They are the contract, the picce-price, the lease,
public-account, state-use, and public works and ways.

The earliest form developed and used was the con-
tract system, or its variation, the piece-price system.
The contract system simply involved the letting out
of the labor of prisoners to an outside contractor who
furnished the machinery and the raw material and
supervised the prisoners’ work by men in his employ.
The prison management had nothing to do with the
operation, its task being only that of guarding the
convicts. This system was particularly vicious, since
the convict workers were at the mercy of the con-
tractor’s supervisors.

As stated above, the piece-price system is merely
a variation. In this, the contractor furnished the raw
material and received the finished product, paying
the prison administration so much for the work ae-
cepted by him. Exploitation was minimized, for the
administration hired its own supervisors. But in some
states not even the piece-price system intervened to
relieve the vicious features of the contract system.

Though prison labor was introduced in the newly
urganized penitentiaries after Pennsylvania blazed
the trail in the Walnut Street Jail in 1790, the real
beginning of the expansion and high prosperity of
the practice did not come until the years 1825 to 1840.
In the earlier epoch, sales were difficult because there
were no well established connection between the pri-
son shop and the costumers in the outside community.
However, with the rise of the merchant capitalist in
America, in the period following 1825, this fatal de-
ficiency was remedied and an intermediary was found
who was glad to furnish the raw materials and take
the finished product at an agreed-upon rate. The
system of contract-labor, then, was only one incident
in the rise of the merchant-capitalist, of which home
labor and the sweat-shop were other phases in his
attempt to obtain cheap labor. The merchant-capital-
ist had, of course, been the vital element in the Kng-
lish industrial system from 1600 to 1800.

The prisons of New York state enthusiastically
adopted this new method of working convicts. As
early as 1819, the Auburn prison was authorized by
the legislature to provide convicts with “joint-la-
bour” by the day, with solitary confinement by night.
Deficits in operating prisons soon gave way to actual
profits. By 1828 the prisons of Auburn and Sing Sing
were actually paying for themselves.

Other states, impressed by the financial results
obtained by New York’s prisons introduced the con-
tract system in their penal programs—but Pennsyl-
vania still frowned upon it. Dedicated to the prin-
ciple of separate confinement with each prisoner in
his own cell, this state could seareely take advantage
of the congregate labor that was imperative if con-
viet labor was to be exploited to its fullest advan-
tage. This inability of the Pennsylvania system to

pay for itself was one of its main weaknesses and
militated against its being adopted in other states.

Aside from the frankly partisan criticisms hurled
at contract labor by advocates of the Pennsylvania
system, there was little opposition and a great deal
of praise for this new working device for convicts.
Free labor objected from the start, but it was not

organized, and little attention was paid to it. Here
and there, where trade unions were strong enough to

be articulate, resolutions were passed condemning
the system as being unfair to free labor.

Just as the rise of contract convict labor was in-
timately associated with the rise of the merchant-
capitalists, so the opposition to it was inseparably
connected with the development of labor organiza-
tions, their struggle to improve the conditions of the
laboring classes, and their entry into politics imme-
diately after the War between the States and the
reconstruction period.
