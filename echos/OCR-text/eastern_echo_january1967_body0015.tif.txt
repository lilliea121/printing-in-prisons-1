Book Review

Honest To Gov — Irreverently!

by Sterling B. James

Apparently, it is serious business among millions
of contemporary Christians when one of their spirit-
ual leaders holds forth in a book on such metaphysi-
cal exotica as the exact physical location of God in
time and space. Never mind who or what is God or
whether God is, in fact, anything. The thing to know
about these days is space-time continuum—albeit
divine. Discover God’s whereabouts and all other
questions concerning God resolve themselves into a
beautiful, spiritual mosaic.

On this question of spatial metaphysics, Chris-
tians mean business and anyone doubting this has
only to read the tortured reviews and taunting re-
ports which swirled around Bishop A. T. Robinson’s
deeply religious, semi-rational, eclectic little book,
“Honest To God” when it first exploded upon the
literary scene several years ago. The book should
have been a bust, but such is the credulity of modern
Christians, the book became an instant best seller
and created quite a stir.

Far be it from the intent of this review to mini-
mize such weighty matters. Nevertheless, it does
seem odd to learn through Bishop Robinson’s book
that corporeal geography, after all these years, has
never been really established. You would think that
something might have been done about this embar-
rassing oversight even as late as the eighteenth and
nineteenth century when disputations regarding the
“materiality,” “substantiality,” and “composition-
ality,” of divine phenomenon were finally resolved.

More’s the Pity!

After the elapse of several millennia, one now dis-
covers that Christians (and perhaps, even Jews)
haven’t the foggiest as to the whereabouts of God
and for all they know he might well have been, and
might well be, residing in Hades!

It’s really too much. Think about the fate of all
those souls—and there must be billions of them—
which departed this life with such high hopes.
Stranded out there; milling aimlessly about in the
ereat somewhere; no place to go, no one to run to;
no compass, no north star, no nothing—in limbo, so
to speak. Too late to save them now, unfortunately.

But for those of the faithful who are so fortunate
as to be contemporaries of the Reverend John A. T.

Hastern Echo/January, 1967

Robinson, Bishop of Woolwich, London, England,
should find comfort in the fact that the Almighty
Hideway has been, after long last, more or less, dis-
covered by the Bishop.

All becomes clear through Bishop Robinson’s
vision. The crooked is made straight and the rough
places plane. But first it is necessary for Christians
to “throw up all orthodox notions of God up there,
God out there, Ole man in the sky,” and all that pie.
Such notions are at variance with Christianity’s
basic theology anyway. “God in heaven,” according
to the Bishop, “is metaphorical and is a stumbling
block rather than an aid to finding God, particularly
in the light of modern science and technology (Co-
pernicus, you know).

“Shake the Foundations of Christiology!” exhorts
the Bishop. “Cast off your primitive fears as mani-
fest in all those old symbolisms and superstitions!”

Plowing gidily ahead, Bishop Robinson not only
defines God anew for the faithful but, borrowing
whole cloth from Paul Tillich, tells exactly where
God is and who God is:

“God is in you!”
“How’s that again?”

“That’s it. Not out there or up there but in you.
The depth of your life, the source of your being and
your ultimate concern; that which you take seri-
ously about yourself without reservations. That is
God.”

“Could you be a little more specific? Dm not sure
I’m reading you.”

“Simply put, God is depth! Forget everything
traditional you have learned about God. God is, in a
word, the infinite, inexhaustible depth and ground
of being.”

Bishop Robinson considers that definition to be a
more perspicacious and simpler rendering of God’s
whereabouts than that definition reputedly delivered
by Jesus Christ, i.c., “Our Father who art in heaven.
ete

But it is this very language attributed to Jesus
which exercises the Bishop. There seems to be the
implication that Gospel history has a stature supe-
rior to bare, ordinary secular history and attempts
