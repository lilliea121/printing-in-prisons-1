I am today and yesterday, the meaning of time,
I am the compensating weariness, for sorrows of mind;
1 am the stage of life where each has a role
To be lived—to be played in the face of a goal.
To be enacted without flaw, no emotions to be shed, by THOMAS WILLIAMS
To be held accountable for every word that is said;
Yet I have endured with reason intact,
Vet have I striven to face every fact.
T am two million people around one lonely soul,
I am two million heartaches in one pot of gold;
I am love without meaning, I am meaning without strife,
I am joy, | am wisdom, I am sorrow—I AM LIFE.
I am the cries of a baby, I am the tears of many mothers,
Iam the friendship man shows toward ls many brothers;
I am the tender caresses when lovers depart,
I am the meaning of living, within every heart;
I I am the wars of a world with its pain and its strife,
I am death and destruction—I AM LIFE.
Iam alittle boy playing in the minute grains of sand,
I am the philosopher evaluating the theories of man;
IT am the earth within, the universe without,
A Tr I am the soul of man, with all his torments and doubt;
I am the lion in a cage who longs to be free,
I am the fate of all men, and things that will be.
Yes! I am life, the ruler of all,
e The multitude of millions who come at my call;
| ife The weak and oppressed, the strong and the brave,
The humble and pious, the thief and the knave.
Though I am worshipped by millions, I stand not in esteem,
For those foolish ones who live in a dream;

I am comfort to those who bear the pain and strife,
I am all things to all men, I am God—I AM LIFE.

The total donation of 105 pints was no true indication of the willingness to give displayed by the
men, as many would-be donors were turned away due to an iron deficiency.
