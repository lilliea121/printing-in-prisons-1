Contrary to all you may have read
or heard the result of a commutation
hearing is, more often than not...
“Refused.”

The decision, favorable cr unfavor-
able, affects everyone concerned.
Upon being refused the petitioner has
no alternative but to “wait until next
year.”

The prisoner’s first knowledge of
commutation is acquired during his
early days of confinement. He is as
unknowing of its workings as many of
the general public.

One Prisoner's View

by JOHN FINNEGAN

I am aware that in this issue some very prominent and distinguished
citizens of this Commonwealth will also express their views on commutation.
While the views expressed by our honorable guests are supported by the author-
ity and experience of their office, I weleome the opportunity to present the views
of a prisoner who acquired his knowledge of the subject after he arrived in
prison (grass roots level).

I sincerely believe that a look at the subject as seen:from the prisoner’s
point of view can do no harm; it may help to offset the distortion to which com-
mutation has been subjected (but NOT in the Penal Press).

There are many ramifications to the subject of commutation of sentences
and all of them seemed to be designed to thwart the efforts of a prisoner seeking
clemency. Inmates are frequently told that they lack insight. If this is true, it
might be attributed to the fact that they are kept so much in the dark on a sub-
ject in which they naturally have a profound interest—their freedom.

The subject of “applying” for commutation has more prisoner appeal than
anything else except the opportunity to walk out the front gate as a free man.

The “results” of the hearings of the Board of Pardons are something else.
This is a subject that leaves the petitioner in a state of bewilderment—all he
will ever learn about the hearings is that he was . . . Refused! There may have
been no “open” opposition at the hearing, perhaps the Judge did not oppose, the
District Attorney did not object, the institution had submitted a favorable re-
port, and the result . . . Refused!

It is tragic for the petitioner and his family because they will never be
told why he was refused. The prisoners who are cast in the role of villian in this
monthly drama would greatly appreciate some “positive” information about
what goes on behind the scenes of this drama. It has been customary to keep the
petitioner uninformed as to the reasons why the Board has decided to refuse his
application. This procedure affects not only the petitioner, but also his family,
who know only that their loved one can apply again the following year. Then
they will again be confronted with the problem of raising the money for the
lawyer’s fees, which poses another question—should a lawyer take a person’s
money in an action where the reason for an unfavorable result is kept a seeret?
This might be a sticky question when it is considered that the person asking it
is In no position to bargain, and that he is in the position of asking for mercy.
The old adage that “beggars can’t be choosers” might well apply here, but by
the same token the “beggar” in this instance might be more prudent about risk-
ing the much needed money that his family has invested in an attempt to ad-
vance his opportunity to freedom.

When learned lawyers, distinguished business men, wives, mothers,
fathers, clergymen, and in some cases even judges, appear on behalf of a pris-
oner before the Board, and the result is . . . Refused! What in the world can a
prisoner say on the subject?

Most prisoners have never heard of the Board of Pardons until they ar-
rived in prison. Usually a cell-mate or some fellow prisoner will tell the new
man that he can “try for a commute” in a couple of years. Now he doesn’t know
what a “commute” really is, but he sure is glad to hear about it. He can’t wait
until visiting day. so that he can tell his folks, who also won’t know what he is
talking about. But they, too, will be glad to hear about it, and will offer to help
in any way they can when the time comes.

When does this time come? The desire to apply for a commutation of sen-
tence is born while the inmate is still on the quarantine block, but rarely is the
