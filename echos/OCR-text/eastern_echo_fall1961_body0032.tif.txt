OP JULY (rilelO leWleNis

The inside world of sports saw a number of new faces on the scene for the annual
Fourth of July field events, but when the dust had settled the smiles of the victors were
on just about the same faces that have worn them in the past.

With so many types of contests, the events were given an early start with several
elimination rounds being held on the eve of the fourth, and when morning rolled
around the program was in high gear.

As anticipated the track tests were a personal duel between “Big Shakey’’ Young and
Elmo ‘‘Nick’’ Nickens. These two were given a run for their money in the elimination
rounds by speedsters such as Billy Hollowell, Dave Crockett, Ernest Jackson, Little Hea-
vy, George McFeat, Ray Thompson, Jimmy White, Billy Gardner, Al Shep, and others.

However in the finals of the hundred yard dash Shakey managed to
stave off Nick’s onslaught for first place while two other survivors of
the elimination rounds, Ed Wallace and Ernest ‘“‘Lucky”’ Jackson came
in a close third and fourth.

The 220 saw Shakey repeating his stretch drive as he again snatched
victory from the fleet-footed Nickens. Eddie Dennis and Billy Holley
provided the pressure on the leaders and came in third and
fourth.

In the shot put, a perennial winner, Dave Croxton, let the
other contestants draw the admiration of the crowd with lengthy
practice heaves and then calmly walked off with the champion-
ship title still in his grasp. “‘Big Lou’’ finished second while Nick-
ens was a surprising third. Fourth place was taken by George
Reid.

Denied vitae ay in the dashes and shot-put, Nick found the low

hurdles more to his taste and blazed to

victory. Close behind, Turk Beatty bet-
tered Ed Wallace for second place while

Al Shep had used up all his energy in the

two elimination rounds and was content

with fourth place money.

The high jump found the “Big D,”
Donnie Wise, again defeating a host of
contenders and retaining his crown.

In a more quiet event, Marshall Pep-
pers, knocked off seven challengers
in consecutive order and was crown-
ed King of the Boccie courts. Little
Heavy was a surprise second while
John Gemberling came in third and
Stosh placed fourth. The doubles

contest in Boccie gave Peppers
the chance to add more luster to
his title and he was up to the chal-
lenge as he and Earlon Sell won
several hard fought matches, to
come home first. Second place
was taken by Stosh and Gember-
ling.

While the track fans were root-
ing their favorites on, the devot-
ees of the weights were silently
urging on their own champions.

The lightweight division had a
new champion as Charley Gin-
dles three Olympic lifts totaled
545 lbs. fifteen over that of his
nearest rival Eddie Dennis who
amassed a sum (cont. page 31)
