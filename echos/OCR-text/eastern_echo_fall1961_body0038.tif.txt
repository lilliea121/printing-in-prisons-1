tually, Bob has plenty of basketball background, as
he formerly played for Western Michigan and at
present is thinking of transferring to Temple. After
watching him drive in for a layup several times, we
are willing to give him a recommendation to Harry
Litwack-anytime.

Both teams were using the same strategy as they
held their hatchet man for action in the second quar-
ter. Starting for the outsiders was John Beck, brother
of Penn All-American Ernie Beek, Larry Hackett,
Buckton, Jim McAndrews, and Thornton.

The Easterners, Billy Holley, Jake Welty, Alvin
Young, Cochise Bell and Elijah Sheperd found the
opposite five a little slow and opened with a fast
break that had them leading 22-17 when the first
period ended.

Starting the second period for the visitors were
the hcavyweights; Don Buckley, Big John Scholt-
mann, John Breese, Dave Connell, and Charley Ad-
ams. Entering the ring, bee pardon, coming on the
court, for the easterners, that is, were John O’Brien,
Herb Allen, Battles, Bill Barnes, and Chuck.

The Eastern Heavyweights proved too much as
they stomped their way for twenty-five points and
held their opponents to seventeen. Bill Barnes made
some fantastic shots and plumped through six field
eoals in this period alone. Barnes also ended up high
man. of the game with a total of twenty- two points.

Its @ ofnnelh that Don Buckley isn’t going to take
all these defeats lying down and the mind shudder 's
at the thought of him, Larry Hackett, and “Barrels’
Dougherty plotting div e revenge.

Of course, our side has a trio of able plotters in
coach Thompson, John O’Brien and Big Shakey

MEET A FRIEND

Dougherty, the
portly gentleman on your left,

‘Barrels’

is a familiar figure to Eastern
Basketball fans and those others
that follow the sport in the Nar-
beth and Southwest Phila. lea-
gues on the outside. A firm
believer in the theory of using
sports in combating delinquency,
he gives freely of his time to
referee and help organize games
throughout the city.

PIGSKIN PREVIEW

Kastern’s football season was given a rousing sendoff
this past Labor Day when two exhibition teams took
to the gridiron. The Devils, under the leadership of
Tookie “Crane cashed in for one TD in the first half
and that was all they needed as they held Rob Wat-
son’s eleven scoreless. Holding down the line for ‘the
Devils was Charley Gindle at center, Carmine at right
‘euard and Big Pitts at left guard. Alternating in the

tackle slots were Bobby Anderson, Walt Young,
MeVeey, and Joe Chink.

The Devil’s backfield featured speed in depth with
three of Eastern’s fastest; Socrates Cantoral, Nick
Nickens and Murray Dickerson, running out of the
halfback slots. At fullback, Roosevelt was in mid-
season condition as he ripped through the opposing
line. Tookies passing was beautiful to watch as he
tossed pinpointers to Willie Green and Al Shep. On
defense, Leonard Massey, team manager, gave the
enemy a rough road to travel.

Watson’s team had several scoring opportunities
but seemed reluctant to take the ball over the last
stripe. Rob started at the helm but gave way to John
O’Brien in the first half. Using quick openers O’Bie
suckered the defense into drawing tight and fired a
long pass that should have spelled touchdown—hbut
it was dropped.

Acting as a blocking back and decoy Big Shakey
Young gave an excellent forecast of the job he in-
tends to do in the coming season. Billy Holley was
up to his usual tricks, slanting off tackle for yardage
while Stonewall’s running brought the spectators to
their feet. A rather heavy offensive line saw Peewee
at center, Jose and Lou at guards, Joe Miller and
Pencil Willie at tackle, and Jake the snake and John
Gandy at end. Bill Barnes and Kuhn were demons
on defense.

A second touchdown was scored by the Devils
when Tookie threw a short bullet to Willie Green as
the gun sounded.
