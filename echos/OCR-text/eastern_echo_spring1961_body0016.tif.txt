or criminal behavior? and (3) what should be the
medico-legal status of a neurotic defendant in terms
of accountability to the law?

I do not suppose that any educated person denies
the existence of neurotic obsessions and compulsions.
A patient might have a powerful, an overwhelming,
urge to do something absurd—an urge so overriding
that it seizes consciousness while it dethrones con-
science. It may well be that the penalty for abstain-
ing is a severe one: nauseating sickness, choking
panic or almost-unbearable anxiety. All this is true.

3ut is such a compulsion irresistible? In any 100
per cent sense, no. If the patient will pay the price
in terms of his anxiety, he can resist—and in the
presence of others, he often does hold his hand back.
Assume an obsessive-compulsive about to set a fire.
A bystander walks by. The patient
abstains. If the bypasser remains,
the patient waits. His anxiety may
mount, he may get palpitations, he
may feel faint, he may well-nigh
drown in his anxiety. But he can
and does wait. The impulse is re-
sisted: It is, therefore, not irresis-
tible. This is the basis for ancient
but useful Bramwell formula:
vould the defendant have com-
mitted the crime had there been a
policeman at his elbow? With some
psychotics — indeed, with Me-
Naughten himself—the answer is
‘‘yes.”’ So compelling and irra-
tional was the urge that the pres-
enee of the policeman would not
stop him. When a paranoiac is
being apprehended, he often as-
saults the policeman who has come
to take him. Here the impulse is not resisted in the
presence of a policeman. With neurotic compulsions,
however, the answer to the Bramwell query is: “‘no.”’
The defendant would not have committed the crime
had there been a policeman at his elbow.

So, with neurotic impulses, the answer to the first
question is that such an impulse is not absolutely ir-
resistible, only relatively irresistible. The patient can
abstain at the cost of considerable anxiety. One must
avoid sanctimonious moral judgments here. Only he
who has suffered such panic, such miserable anxiety,
has the right to say smugly: ‘‘if you had the will
power, you could have refrained. Since you yielded
to the impulse, you must suffer the consequences.’’

The second question is whether neurotic obsessions
ean lead to antisocial behavior. Wertham says “‘no.”’
Here is the way he puts it:

‘*., . There is, with one exception, no symptom in
the whole field of psychopathology that would cor-
respond to a really ungovernable or uncontrollable
impulse. That exception is an obsessive-compulsive
neurosis. . . . Compulsions play no role in criminal
acts. It can be stated flatly that compulsions are al-
ways unimportant and harmless acts. A patient may
have to count the windows, to wipe off the doorknob,
to avoid stepping on eracks in the pavement. But he

never has to commit a truly impulsive criminal act.
.. . In the whole literature of psychiatry, there is
not a single case where a violent act constituted a
symptom in an obsessive-compulsive neurosis. ‘I'he
‘irresistible impulse’ rule is socially backward .. .”’
(Bold mine).

This dogma sounds so sweeping that one’s immed
ate reaction is that it simply cannot be true. Pyro.
mania is a well-known compulsion. Most psychiatrists
would say it was an obsessional or neurotic kind of
compulsion. Arson is a violent act constituting a
symptom of an obsessive-compulsive neurosis.

The difficulty here is this: there are actually two
kinds of neurotic impulses, one being a ritual to pro-
tect against guilt and one being a sadistic act to bring
on self-punishment. In the first category, the com-
pulsive act must be harmless. Its whole purpose is
transfer of an effect from guilt-
laden to innocent behavior. This
Innocence is of the very fabric of
the neurosis. In Alexander’s hap-
py phrase, the compulsion is “‘a
bribe to the superego.’’ The pa-
tient can say to his conscience: “*I
am just counting cracks or wash-
ing my hands; an innocent ritual;
really I have not sinned; see how
innocent this act is, and how busy
I keep myself with it.’’

But these compulsions never
reach the court; within this frame-
work, Wertham was right.

Unhappily, there is a whole c¢al-
endar of crime which can be
reasonably attributed to neurotic
compulsiveness. Kleptomania and
pyromania, to mention two, are
antisocial and dangerous. Other neurotically rooted
impulse violations include open lewdness, writing
of poison pen letters, sending obscene letters through
the mails, indecent self-exposure, sexual acts against
children, voyeurism and the like. These are antisocial
and some are very traumatizing to their victims. So
the answer to the second question must be: yes,
neurotic compulsion can lead to antisocial behavior.

The third question concerns the accountability of
these patients. This is a matter of social policy rather
than medical definition. However, certain aspects of
it are worth a little reflection by the doctor. I think
here of the moral, the practical, the psychological
and the social aspects of the impulses of the neurotic.

J{E third type of irresistible impulse is the
rage reaction in the otherwise normal person.
(The other two were psychotie and neurotic
impulses.) These rage reactions inelude sud-
den fits of temper, the fury of the cornered
: = psychopath, impulsive violence in people who
are, clinically, neither neurotic nor psychotic, and the
violence of alcoholism. In varying degrees, all people
are subjects to attacks of rage, potential or expressed,
brief bit of violence would be a great relief. So a man
might look through a store window and see some-
thing he wants with such longing that, for a moment,
