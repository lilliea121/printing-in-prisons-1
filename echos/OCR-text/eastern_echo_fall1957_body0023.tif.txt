Lady with a ludicrously absurd side swinging gallop.
All day they run around visiting, sniffing, lifting

Swampy hit a triple, they both rounded the bases
and slid into third base at the same time—a hilarious
sight.

Came the late afternoon. The scene is set:
Major Brierley is at the gate ready to leave.
Swampy says ‘‘Good-Bye’’ and Lady starts slowly
and reluctantly walking toward the gate. Lady
stops, plainly chewing the bone of separation; she
looks back at Swampy. Visibly gloomy, Lady once
again starts toward the gate. She stops mid-way and
looks back at Swampy, a picture of sadness and
indecision, she turns and looks at the opening gate
and back again at Swampy. Lady cannot move,
maybe she can feel the air of warmth and charm
she has created. Major Brierley’s voice breaks the
spell, “Time to go home, Lady,’’ he says. Deject-
edly cast down, Lady slowly walks out. The pond-
erous gate closes.

the league after experimenting with five teams de-
creased to four teams and finally to three.
toward the finish line and championship, it is any-

team in a seven (7) game play-off, starting on Labor
Day.

Notes While Bench Warming

Jake is the home run king, but Fricker stated
recently that he is ready to take over Jake’s title
now that his ankle is better. Billy Hollowell is de-
finitely the league leading hitter, batting to date a
neat .600. Saby says he will be a changed player
now that he has acquired his barber’s heense, any-
body need a close shave? Heinemann continues as
the winningest pitcher; George Kalvidis is still mak-
ing most of the batters look like windmills when he’s
serving them up. Paul Neal is the best utility man
in the league for my money. Capable of holding

slump with a bang! Obie and Seratchie are the only
managers who held on to their jobs despite the chan-
ges and shake-ups throughout the season.
