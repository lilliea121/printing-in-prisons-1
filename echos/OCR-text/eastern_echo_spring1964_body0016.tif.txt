“Hey Carl, over here,’ called Marty.

Carl stopped and looked around. Seeing Marty
coming towards him, he automatically put his hand
inside his pocket to feel for the next to the last time,
his few crumbled bills and hand full of small change.
He sighed deeply and smiled, as Marty came up to
him grinning his best little boy grin.

“Carl baby,” said Marty, “‘tell me a piece of your
beautiful poetry while we walk through the park.”

“Sure,”’ said Carl, “glad to. How about Shake-

speare?”’

“Fine,” said Marty, ‘“‘but on second thought, how
about if we talk over a couple of hamburgers——that
is, if you have any money? I'ma little flat right now
but I’m sure hungry.”

“Okay, Marty,’ said Carl, as they walked to the
park’s exit, ““We’ll wait until later,’ and added in a
low whisper, ‘“‘and each man in his time plays many
parts.

‘‘Huh,”’ said Marty, “what did you say?”’

“Oh nothing much,” said Carl. “] mentioned some
Shakespeare before and just happened to remember
one of the things he said. It just popped into my
head.”

““Yes,’’ said Marty, ‘well, what was it? I mean all
oft iD”

‘Well,’ said Carl, “Shakespeare said that “All the
world is a stage and all the men and women are mere-
ly players. They have their exits and their entrances,

and each man in his time plays many parts.

“Say,” said Marty with a laugh, “‘that’s pretty
good.”’

“Yes it is,’ answered Carl. “‘] was just wondering
how many people fool themselves into thinking that
the role they play most often is themselves; and if
they honestly believe that the people around can't see
through their disguise—and if they expect to succeed
with their act indefinitely.”

Marty turned his head sharply and looked at Carl,
but Carl was walking with his head up looking intent-
ly at the starry sky. Marty looked closely at his face
but could read nothing there. He turned his head
away, his forehead creased into thoughtful lines, won-
dering, ‘‘just what in the hell did he mean by that.”

AIN’T YOU GOT NO MAGAZINES?

You got anything at all to read,
something to kill this time | don’t need?
Give me something so my time don’t drag,
a new Reader's Digest or last month’s Stag.
There’s nothin’ to read but a bunch of books;
what about those Jets and that stack of old Looks?
| can make it till bedtime with a Cavalier. . .
Man! send me them damn magazines down here.
I dug the ball game and the weather and news
and | spent two hours shinin’ my shoes. . .
Send me somethin’! Boy, this ole cell’s dead;
if a guy just sits he'll go out of his head.
Hey! I’ll trade ya this Life for those Silyer Screens. . .

WHAT?
Poetry - Say, man! Ain’t you got no magazines?
