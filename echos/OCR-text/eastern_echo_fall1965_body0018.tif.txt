Eighteen years ago, in December 1947, three months
after being discharged honorably from the U. S. Army,
Harry R. Zietz was sent to prison on a charge of first
degree murder. Nine of those years were under the
dealth penalty....and each and every day was spent in
solitary confinement. Of this time, five and one-half
spent on ““death row’ at Rockview State Correctional
Institution. The usual stay on death row is only a few
days.

While there he witnessed, by senses other than
sight, apout twenty executions and was within the clut-
ches of the electric chair on twenty-eight different oc-
casions; being as close to death as three hours....one

hour....twenty-five minutes. These encounters with
death exhausted Zietz both physically and mentally.

The thoughts of the throes of death on each and ev-

ery one of those twenty-eight breath taking moments
were not only shared by Zietz but by his mother and
father, whose health over the years declined rapidly,
They “‘died’ each and every time their son was sched-
uled for execution. His father, who bore the strain of
this for eight years, died of a cerebral hemorrhage in
1956. More agonizing than impending death was Harry’s
feeling of being indirectly responsible for death of his
father, and for his direct responsibility for the anguish
caused his beloved mother and family as well as the
family of the man who was killed.

Despite the many years of suffering and torment, he ,
never felt-bitter towards anyone because he firmly be-
lieves and has long recognized that this experience re- \
sulted in personality maturation. He acknowledges his

responsibility for the death of another man, and he re-
grets his part in the crime. This permutation all hap-
pened within a span of five days—first five days on
death row!
