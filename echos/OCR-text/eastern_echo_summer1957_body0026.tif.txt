On Monday, January 28, 1957, Professor Negley
K. Teeters, Criminologist, sat behind closed doors
with a group of inmates who comprise the staff of
the EASTERN ECHO. The main purpose of the
meeting was to discuss ways and means of lessening
the adverse publicity given to prisoners and ex-
convicts by some member papers of the free press.

Sensing a slightly strained atmosphere, due per-
haps to the unusual and unprecedented nature of
the meeting, Dr. Teeters took the verbal initiative.
His evident sincerity, friendliness, and just-right
inflections and asides soon dispelled the air of con-
straint and kicked off a sizzling discussion that
lasted about three hours.

PRIME TARGET SEEN

ECHO had dedicated itself to improving pris-
oner-public relations. Its staff knew, as do all the
inmates here, that an ‘‘unfavorable press’’ hampered
any movement to create a more realistic and fair
picture of the prisoner in the mind of the public.
What to do about the situation, however, waited
upon the suggestion of the professor.

TARGET’S TARGET EXPLAINED

Clarifying present editorial and public atti-
tudes, he pointed out: a man could be arrested with-

out too great a stigma being placed upon him.
Even convicted and sent to a penitentiary, the
stigma was not too pronounced. Usually, only a
man’s immediate family and neighborhood were
concerned. But once released, or about to be re-
leased from prison as an ‘‘ex-convict,’’ the full bur-
den is upon him.

‘It’s not the criminal who frightens us. It’s
the ex-convict, and so the man trying to become an
EX-convict. Apparently, it is the time spent in
prison that creates our uneasiness. What Harry
Barnes calls the ‘convict bogey’, the professor ex-
plained. Why this fear of the ex-con? ‘‘What
else! The abnormal atmosphere of the prison neg-
ates all the human attributes of a man. Prison is
the reverse of the outside situation. You see, we
really do know what happens to a man who under-
goes confinement. That knowledge is often ex-
pressed in society’s reaction to his return.’’

DIRECT CONTACT URGED

After discussion of this and other problems basic
to the situation, Dr. Teeters recommended direct
contact with the local newspapers. It was agreed
that the Editor of this magazine would write to the
three leading newspapers in this area, requesting an
interview for ECHO staff with their representatives.
It was further agreed that the only possible ap-
