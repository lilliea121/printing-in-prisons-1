From the RED CROSS

Happy New Year to you and your staff, and all the wonderful
donors who co-operated so generously in the Bloodmobile visit of Dec-
ember 23, 1961. It was a great help to the Red Cross needs of the
Holiday Season—121 pints of blood, and the biggest total of all Xmas
visits.

We wish to thank everybody concerned with the operation and
tell you how grateful we are for having the blood needs of those
unfortunately ill people taken care of with your help.

The Donor Cards are enclosed and the tally sheet will follow when
the names are recorded in Red Cross files.

Very sincerely

Mary T. Foster (Mrs. H. A.)

Your past year’s record shows The next visit from the
255—Production donors RED CROSS will be

Congratulations on a very fine record. J | LY 3 rd
