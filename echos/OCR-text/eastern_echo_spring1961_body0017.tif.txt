he is tempted to break the window. A man with a
strong sex drive might be in a subway ear at night
alone with a strange and exciting girl; and to him
comes a Strong urge to copulate with her by force if
necessary. Driving an automobile there may be the
urge to step on the gas and go 100 miles an hour when
the road is clear and the engine is purring smoothly.
There may also be the urge to choke the bridge
partner who has just trumped your ace, to knock
down the man who has said something sarcastic.

But somehow most of us restrain the antisocial im-
pulse. Society says that punishment will be visited
on the man who does not restrain it. If the phrase
“irresistible impulse’? be defined with enough gen-
crosity, all of these rage and alcohol reactions, would
fall within the definition. Since I have already indi-
cated that the irresistible impulse doctrine should not
apply to psychoneurotic compulsions, I need only
add that a fortiori, it should not apply to the rage
reaction in the otherwise normal person.

There is little to be said about brainstorms, about
the allegedly temporary insanity that comes in a trice
and leaves without a trace. The psychiatrist can
recognize a psychoneurosis, for psychoneurosis is a
way of life, not a transient reaction. He can recog-
nize a psychosis, for that is his simplest professional
duty. In the absence of psychosis or neurosis, the
brainstorm which leads to violence may be due to
alcohol or to frustrations. It is playing with words

Summary

RRESISTIBLE impulse is a defense in a
lozen states. Many believe it should be a de-
ense in all.. As contemplated by the law, the
phrase ‘“‘irresistible impulse’’ refers, or was
yriginally intended to refer, only to the com-
“pulsiveness of an active psychosis. This is
what the law means when it throws the protecting
cloak of this doctrine around a defendant: it means
he was insane and his impulse was rooted in that in-
sanity.

The doctor, however, sees two other levels of such
impulses. In addition to the psychotic impulse, he
recognizes a variety of neurotic impulses, and also
rage reactions which lead to violence in otherwise
normal people.

It is generally agreed that a person who commits
an antisocial act because of a psychotic impulse
should not be treated as guilty. No special legal doc-
trine is needed to protect him. The only standard of
responsibility in most states is the M’Naghten rule.
This does not specially exculpate impulsive behavior.
But it does shield the person who does not appreciate
the wrongfulness of his acts. A psychotic in the grip
of a frenzied impulse cannot weigh the legal or moral
rightness of his acts. He is thus protected by the gen-
eral rule. Furthermore, his act is not voluntary be-
cause the psychosis destroyed his free agency. An
involuntary act never amounts to a crime. A special
irresistible impulse doctrine is not needed to protect
the psychotic defendant.

Eastern Eeho

There seems to be no justification for exculpating
the otherwise normal person who commits a crime
because of a rage reaction, acute alcoholism or the
frenzied fury of a cornered psychopath. If such acts
were not considered crimes, then no one would ever
be responsible for anything. All antisocial acts are
the result of emotional drives which—by the defini-
tion of ‘‘antisocial’’—are also, in a sense, abnormal
drives.

The neurotic compulsion is at the nub of the prob-
lem. At this level there are two very different kinds
or neurotic impulsiveness. Failure to recognize this
has caused much confusion. Traditionally, the psy-
chiatrist thinks of an obsessive-compulsive act as an
innocent ritual needed to protect against the guilt
feeling generated by the patient’s thought of sin. All
such obsessions must be harmless since their purpose
is to display innocence. The phrase ‘‘neurotic com-
pulsiveness”’ or ‘‘neurotie irresistible impulse’’ in the
psychiatrist’s mind conjures up the image of one of
these harmless rituals.

But to the lawyer or judge, it suggests pyromania,
kleptomania, an urge to send obscene or poison-pen
letters, a compulsion towards self exposure or some
other traumatizing act. So the lawyer and doctor are
not talking the same language when they speak of
neurotic irresistible impulse. The doctor thinks of the
harmless obsession, the lawyer thinks of the danger-
ous impulse.

It would be socially hazardous to exempt the latter
group from accountability. Under these circum-
stances, offenders cannot be committed to hospitals
because, by definition, they are sane.

If they are considered legally irresponsible, they
cannot be detained in jails or prisons either.

If a person has a powerful, repetitive neurotic urge
to do violence, the protection of society requires that
he be restrained. Unless he is held responsible, he
simply cannot be lawfully restrained.

It is technically incorrect to say that such a person
is in the helpless grip of an irresistible impulse. The
neurotic with this type of impulse can, and ‘usually
does, control it in the presence of a third party.

In controlling the impulse, the neurotic usually
hurts himself. In yielding to it, he hurts others.

An impulse which can be resisted in the presence of
a third party, is not irresistible. @
