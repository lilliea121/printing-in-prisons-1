COULD HHAR SCAT WILSON’S ‘Clambake
| Five’? jamming it up as I approached the hall.

Hight bar Davis was laying it up in the clouds
with a clarinet ride that would have thawed even
the coldest traffie cop’s heart. This was really a
solid outfit. J walked in on the rehearsal just as
they were stomping the last nail into ‘‘One O’clock
Jump’’. They wrapped it up in a blaze of glory.

“Okay guys, that’s it for now. Dig you later.”’
As Scat started to leave the stage he spotted me and
grinned, ‘‘Hi Johnny, what gives?”’

‘‘Nothing much, Scat. How about an interview
for the Sentinel?’’ I asked.

‘““What do you want? The story of my life as
compared to the Kinsey Report?”’

‘*You know, Seat, the usual stuff. How you
happen to be here fronting this outfit, love interest,
and all that kind of junk.’’

He shrugged. ‘‘Okay Cuz, you asked for it,
but let’s park it somewhere. I’m beat, man.”

We took two chairs from the bandstand, and he
dropped into one with a sigh of relief. He took the
smoke | offered him, lit up, inhaled deeply, and then
began.

‘“Well daddyo, we might as well take an upbeat
right from here, and then we’ll work our way on
back. Here I am, Scat Wilson, the cat who wanted
his own outfit ever since the Rock of Gibralter was
just a little pebble. Now I’m front man for the hot-
test combo on either side of the equator, and am I
happy? Pops, I’m so sad I feel like I’m playing the
title role at a burial.’’

‘Tt all started about two years ago when I was
lead trumpet for a bunch that played at the ‘Gayety
Burlesque’. On this particular night I’m in the
band pit, and I’m feeling lower than a grave digger’s
shovel. Man, I really had the blues. The generator
for all this static is up on the stage, third from the
left, bouncing herself around with the rest of the
cupcakes in the chorus. Believe me, Cuz, I was real
gone on this chick. Fact is, before the show I asked
her if she would swing those lovely ankles to the
tempo of a wedding march with me. That’s what
started the whole session. Her answer to me went
like this: ‘But Seat, you’re only making sixty a
week, let’s wait till something breaks for you.’ ”’

‘‘Of course this chagrins me no end, and I say
something about all chorus girls being born under
the sign of the dollar. Well, there are quite a few
more she saids and I saids, and then she gives me a
stare that freezes my arteries and takes off back-
stage minus one trumpet man.”’

‘‘At show time, I take my wounded heart into
the pit with me, and all through the performance I
watch Jeanie for some sign of a thaw, but it looks
to me as though her thermometer is getting lower
and lower. By the time Doreen Dare, the feature
act, comes on, I’m feeling as hopeless as the cow
that fell in love with the Bull Durham ad.’’

‘‘Now Miss Dare is a red haired party with blue
