‘*Clinical psychiatrists are used to thinking in terms
of syndromes (such as delusions, hallucinations, de-
pressions, clations, ete.) or of disease entities (such as
schizophrenia, manic-depressive psychosis,  ete.).
Those who have absorbed psychoanalytic concepts
are also accustomed to think in dynamie and genetic
terms such as inner conflicts and their attempted
solutions, and the conditioning by childhood experi-

‘wrong,’ essential in applying the M’Naghten rule,
or the concept of ‘knowing’ the difference between
right and wrong carry a precise psychological or psy-
chiatric meaning. ... .As a result, the psychiatrist
is prevented from using the language in which he has
been trained to organize his thoughts and in which
the meaning, the fringes of meaning and the implica-
tions of each term are familiar to him. Instead, he is
forced to testify in a language not his own, and he
cannot be sure of the implications which his words
may seem to carry to the judge or to the jury.”’

Jurists sometimes do not seem to realize that this is
a real problem. Since the words of the M’Naghten
rule do not seem problematic to them, they are in-
clined to conclude that the reluctant psychiatrists are
are Slow in fulfilling their civie duties or are actually
trying to obstruct the administration of the law be-
cause they disapprove of it.

The primary requisite for any new rule therefore,
is that it bridge this gap between legal and psychia-
tric thinking. Any revision of the legal rule should
be aimed at providing a formula that does not run
counter to current psychiatric concepts, a formula
that will permit the expert witness to give the jury
the fullest and clearest picture possible of what the
defendant’s mental condition actually is.

I submit that the formulation that best accom-
plishes this objective is that adopted by the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1954 in
Durham vs United States, that ‘‘an accused is not
criminally responsible if his unlawful act was the
product of mental disease or mental defect.’’ A sim-
ilar rule has been enforced in New Hampshire since
1869, where it has apparently worked to the complete
satisfaction of all concerned. In the District of Co-
lumbia also, the Durham ease rule has been working
satisfactorily.

Two main objections have been leveled against the
Durham ease rule. First, it is said that the concept
of ‘‘mental disease’’ is ambiguous. Second, it is said
that further ambiguity lies in the word ‘‘product.”’

The first of these objections does not deserve seri-
ous consideration, for the simple reason that it in-
heres in any formulation of the test, existing or
proposed. We may grant that in modern scientific
thinking, there is an unbroken continuum from
‘‘normal’’ to ‘‘abnormal,’’ and that there is no clear
line between them. But this difficulty inheres in any
legal rule on the subject. The M’Naghten Rule also
uses the term ‘‘mental disease or defect,’’ and so,
necessarily, does any substitute that can be proposed.

Eastern Echo

The more serious difficulty involves the use of the
word “‘product.’’ The term implies a causal connec-
tion, and causation, as every lawyer knows, is a
formidable souree of difficulty. Medical men, too,
may have trouble applying this concept. As one of
them has pointed out, ‘‘mental illness does not cause
one to commit a crime nor does mental illness produce
a crime. Behavior and mental illness are inseparable
—one and the same thing.’’ :

But the fact that scientific judgment as to the
causal connection between the disorder and the crim-
inal act may be difficult is no reason for not asking
the expert's opinion. The jury is going to have to
decide that issue, and we should give them the benefit
of any light that the expert witness may be able to
give them.

erhaps one reason why: lawyers are disturbed
at the thought of leaving the jury to flounder
unaided through the intricacies of tracing
causation between the act and the mental
condition, is that we are convinced that the
aw must provide the jury with some clear
and simple rule of thumb by which to determine these
eases. Historically the main argument for the tra-
ditional right and wrong test has been that it satisfies
this need for a rule that is clear and certain. Many ot
its adherents admit that in concentrating on intellec-
tion as the only relevant aspect of mental responsi-
bility it is psychologically outmoded and fallacious,
but they refuse to broaden it because they fear that
any broader test would be too uncertain, too difficult
to prove or disprove, or too easy and therefore too
dangerous. This objection they feel applies to the
Durham case rule at least as much as to any other.

But while at first blush a reading of the right-and-
wrong test makes it seem commendably clear, the
long history of litigation over the meaning of the
various words it employs shows this impression to be
illusory. What is meant by knowing the ‘‘nature and
quality’’ of one’s act? The man who kills another
because of a delusion that God has commanded him
to do so knows the physical nature of the act, but
does he know its quality? Does the word quality refer
to a different aspect of perception from ‘‘nature,’’ or
do the same words mean the same thing? After a
hundred and fifteen years we still don’t know. A
leading English case held in 1916 that the two words
mean only one thing—the physical nature of the act.
Whether this English interpretation is law in this
country, we do not know. None of the thousands of
cases that have repeated and applied this test discuss
the question. Does the phrase ‘‘nature and quality,”’
mean anything different from knowledge that the act
is ‘‘wrong?’’ Would it be material error for a court
to use either the first half of the test or the second
and omit the other? New York has held that this
would be error; two or three other states have said
no, it would make no difference.

And what about the word “‘know,’’ the key word
in the knowledge test? A man may comprehend, at
least on a verbal level, that his act was wrong, but his
understanding may be on a superficial level, without
