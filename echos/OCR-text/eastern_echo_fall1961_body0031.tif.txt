Sandy, Boy Blue Parcell, Brutus, Chick,
Sansom, Dave Croxton, and Sandy are also
fighting for the number one spot as King
of Handball. With five block court being
represented in the handball finals for three
straight years these have to be some tough
players.

On the horse-shoe court Ol’ Percy is still
treating the others with malice as his aim
proves unerring. Stan, Johnny Downs and
Little Micketish are among the host of play-
ers trying to end his domain.

A little further on and its grunt and groan
time as we make the weight courts. Tommy
Brabazon is aiming for rookie of the year
with every pound he presses while Chuck
Gindle is still the best little man to hit the
york scene. Big John still looks impressive
and Bob Solomone lifts enough for two
men. Johnny Bowers acts like there’s no
such thing as age. Eddie Miller, Walt
Young, and Cowboy Barnes are coming on
strong for next years field events. Doc
Woodhouse knows the best medicine is a
strong body and keeps pressing those
weights while John Grandy is right up with
him and doesn’t miss a day. Frank, Little
Joe, J.M.P. Kelly, and Dennis the Menace
are showing a big improvement. Dave
Gibbs is expected to give Bill Archy a run
for the roses in the middleweight division
MEI WSZN

Bob Medina is still reigning as King of
the seven block handball court, but Blackie
Battles is thinking of coming out of retir-
ment and who knows. Joe Antoniweicz still
has a tough line shot while Ray Thompson
and a few others are pressing for honors.

Before we come to the seven block court
there’s a sort of no-mans land where knights
of the Spanish Checkers boards do their
jousting. George Wallace, Charlie Terry
and Mike Hudak take turns dumping each
other and the taunts they throw about are
more ferocious than their play.

Bill Daly, Don McGinley and a few
others have settled on the sport of debating
for their special sport and can deliver opini-
ons on any subject available.

Down in the corner, the Eight block court is see-
ing a passing of Champs as Mike Connelly and Joe
Corvi are growing old gracefully.

Brocklyn Louie Telese is still running hard, while
Jimmy Ryder, a speed demon, Bob Penell, and
Frank Sisak are making their move to take over the
number one rating. Swifty Almedia and Spence
Walden refuse to be left out of the competition, but
those gray hairs aren't exactly premature. Still ex-
perience might compensate for youth because hand-
ball on this court is rugged. Like, ouch, my finger-
nails. Later.
