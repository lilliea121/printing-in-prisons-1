when the outside Radiologist, upon looking over a
large series of plates, was suddenly stopped cold on
discovering an unusual plate. He meditated and
finally admitted he was puzzled as to the interpreta-

that had been accidently stepped upon. Needless
to say, a red face ensued.

Then on to Doctor J. B. Teater’s Office. Doctor
Teater is the Resident Neuro-Psychiatrist, in charge
