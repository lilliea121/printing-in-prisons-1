BASKETBALL

by JIM STEWART

WARRIORS NET BASKETBALL TITLE

Following an abbreviated series of basketball
games which featured outside competition being
hosted by the Cherry Hill Varsity, a league was
formed of four teams, namely, Celtics, Hawks, Madi-
sons, and, last but not least, the eventual champions,
the Warriors.

Upon entering the yard in the afternoon, one
could always expect to see spirited competition on
the basketball court; the same competitive spirit
that was displayed by the Varsity Five during the
outside series. We could see such familiar faces as
Shepherd, Fricker, Big Jake, Shakey, Curley Heath,
Juice Cohen, O’Brien and Woody, along with many
new faces of those inspired by the spirit of competi-
tion. There were many thrilling moments of basket-
ball in these intra-squad games.

As we look back for a moment at some of the
thrilling games we witnessed, it is not too difficult
to understand why the game of basketball is taking
its high place in the world of sports. An apt expres-
sion describing this game would have to go some-
thing like this: “An exciting game of thrills, spills
and competitive eagerness.”

Here’s a complete rundown on each team’s per-
formance :

The Celtics, Hawks and Madisons landed the
early punches to begin the series, but Shakey’s War-
riors came on strong and emerged with the victory.
With scoring honors being shared by Fricker,
Shakey and Lonnie Patrick, the Warriors neared the
half-way mark with their eyes on the League Cham-
pionship. As can be seen in the statistics, the War-
riors dominated the boards and maintained a good
edge in shooting percentage. Under the watchful
eyes of their manager, Shakey, they trotted home
with the Championship.

This was definitely a team effort with each
player sharing in the glory category as they played

hard offensive and defensive ball. One has only to
ask Manager Shakey about his Warriors, and what a
smile he gives out with.

Quoting Shakey: “Whatever I do, whatever
game I play, I do it-with interest and a strong de-
termination to win.”

Your reporter salutes a fighter with spirit and
the will to win. Congratulations Warriors, keep on
fighting!

At the beginning of the season the Madisons,
led by Shep, Big Jake and Blackie, got off to a good
start with a superior balanced team and deliberate
offensive tactics. It seemed as though they would
overtake everyone. With Shep giving some very
impressive performances, backed by a smooth opera-
ting team, the Madisons made a very strong bid, but
it Just wasn’t enough. The Madisons could be called
the unheralded champions, but their bid just could-
n’t jar the Warriors’ determination to win.

Mingo and Pitt, here from Graterford and Pitts-
burgh respectively, checked in with some impressive
play that rates a mention here. Their play gained
the plaudits of the spectators who braved the chilly
air to watch these teams compete for the right to be
called “Cherry Hill Champs.”

To begin the season, the Celtics were managed
by Shep, who was replaced by Adderly early in the
season. Three players, from the Varsity team, name-
ly: Adderly, Junebug and Ray, combined their ef-
forts to put on flashes of basketball artistry. Seor-
