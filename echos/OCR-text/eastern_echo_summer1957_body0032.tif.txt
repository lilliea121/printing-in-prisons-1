Point System

the use he made of it deprived his family of some
necessity. This costs John 50 points—and he is
‘returned to the penitentiary because he is now 50
points short of the necessary 600 point level set to
obtain and remain upon parole. How John will
make up those 50 points in prison depends upon...
John.

Each such case under the point system, whether
the man be in prison or on parole, could be reviewed
each year to determine whether the individual’s
point grant pattern should be altered to meet the
picture he presents, to meet his needs. In light of
this, a man rehabilitating himself in prison in half
the ‘‘time’’ (number of points) thought required
could be re-evaluated and rewarded with the remain-
ing number of points necessary for immediate pa-
role. A man found to be simply ‘‘ going through the
motions’’ could be re-evaluated and presented with
a much stiffer point grant pattern. Of course, if
his picture warranted—he could also lose part of,
or all his initial point grant (which in the ease de-

scribed happened to be 300 points.)

The advantages of this point system are obvi-
ous: sentencing remains in the hands of the judges,
based largely on the crime; the sentence can be ad-
justed to the individual and changes as he himself
changes, whether for good or bad; the individual
earns his release, or causes his own continued deten-
tion; experts who are constantly in touch with the
man determine his point grant pattern (in effect, the
adjustment of the sentence to the individual) and
review and modify it in keeping with his demon-
strated progress or failure.

Admittedly, the presentation of the point system
here is but a brief outline, yet I submit that it can
easily be applied to every offender from the habit-
ual drunkard who is picked up every weekend and
turned out like the Monday morning wash, to the
murderer who now receives a Life sentence. In
