Brief notes on teams:

The Warriors—with Big Ray rebounding, Bucky Bates
sharpshooting, and ol’ Funz making the plays, the team clinched
the first half and jumped off into a second half lead from which
they may not be headed. The Warriors make good use of a fast
break, but when it slows down Al Kemp takes over with deadly
hooks from 15 to 20 feet out. Also on hand are such capable
players as Gaylord, Manny, and another pair of good board
men, Palo and Bowser.

The Royals were picked to be the team to beat but showed
dull edges despite the brilliant board work of Steve Dejewski
and Carl Blessing. The teams failure seems partly due to their
inability to get the ball into Richardson at the high post., and
the lack of a really fast break although the Royals possess two
racehorses in Irish and Ralph. Additional strength is apparent
in Kaye Emrold who can break any game open and Gunsmoke,
a fine outside shooter. Tapp is expected to give more than a
helping hand.

The Nationals have height to burn and still aren’t con-
trolling the backboards. Bill Palmer and Bo Breaker are at the
forward spots while Flip Fleming is a better than average
center, possessing a fine hook with either hand. The return of
Lumps soft touch to the outside shot may be the key to the
Nats rise in the standing, but in the meantime the point total
will have to rest on Palmer and rookie Dave Gibbs. A lot of
hope will also ride in the ability of Norman and Snooks, who
head a bench occupied with other standout rookies, Stan Flamie,
Joe Gardner, and little Ike who will also manage the team.

The Hawks main strength is the generalship behind it. Un-
able to play Tuffy will have to get top performances from two
stellar rookies, Mickey Taylor, and Jeff Stockley. The latter is
the owner of a fine jump shot, while Mickey can get that ball
off the players a half foot taller than himself. Big assets will
be Bob Gerlark at forward, the sparkling of the team is Billy
Bell while William Baines and Donald Morton are each com-
peting for starting assignments. Chalk up additional victories
if Don Smith, and Whitney Rosenzweiz, keep giving those tre-
mendous relief jobs when the starting five tire.

Annual Sportsman’s
Evening

James R. Stewart Jr., Reporter

The Annual Sportsman’s Dinner was held Tuesday evening,
February 9, bringing together again all the men who had par-
ticipated in the many sport events throughout the year.

The guests, accompanied by Mr. Banmiller, joined the fel-
lows in a steak dinner set off by the music of Joe Facio
(trumpet), John Wheeler (tenor sax), Abdue (bass), and
Porkey at the piano.

Later, at the Chapel, Mr. Graham introduced Pete Byron as
Toastmaster for the evening. Pete’s voice was a familiar and
most welcome one to the local baseball and fight fans, who lis-
tened attentively to his presentation of the following guests of
honor: Tom Ferrick, formerly with the Phillies and now coach
for the Detroit Tigers; Dick Carter, a new face with the Phillies
(considered a hot prospect); Zack Clayton, one of Philadel-
phia’s top fight referees; Charley Scott, Philadelphia’s leading
welterweight contender; Joe Granby, manager of several
promising fighters, and who is also responsible for the success
of former Lightweight Champ Bob Montgomery; Joe Sweeney,
local referee, ex-boxer, and currently president of the Veteran’s
Boxers Association; Stan Jaworoski, professional football
official, who related to us his interesting experiences in sports,
giving us a bang by heckling Jim MeGee and his company of
sports writers.

Through our Echo, your reporter was pleased to have had
the opportunity of talking to these fine gentleman of the sports
world. Near the conclusion of the evening, he was asked to
impart this message: “Through sports you learn a lot of things
that will make you a happier and better person—and you will
always receive the greatest satisfaction from contributing your
share in honest effort.’

The sportsmen of the past season extend their sincere thanks
and gratitude to Superintendent William J. Banmiller and to
Athletic and Educational Director Mr. Thomas A. Graham.
Their thanks go likewise to Mr. Paul ‘‘Judge” Stilley, who is
responsible for bringing in the many boxers, referees and man-
agers we seldom have the opportunity to see, and to Mr. Richard
Griffen, a basketball enthusiast who has devoted considerable
time in bringing us top outside basketball competition.
