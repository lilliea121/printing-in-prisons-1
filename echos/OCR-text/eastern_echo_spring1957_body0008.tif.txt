At 3:30 A.M. one night in the summer of 1955,
two night patrol officers flashed their lights along the
cobble drive on the north side of Hastern State Pen-
itentiary. As they walked briskly along, the cob-
bles gave way to the dirt of the ball diamond and
finally to the studded wood of the giant truck scale
just off the platform of the Storehouse. Here they
stopped and aimed their lights at the base of the
Storehouse building, As if to meet their beams, two
small cellar windows, dirty yellow and laced with
bars, dimly glowed in the heavy summer night air.

‘‘He’s still down there,’’ muttered the smaller
of the two.

“How about that!’’ his partner replied.
‘‘Twenty-one days and nights without relief! With
Chief Engineer Riley on vacation and the machinery
breaking down all the time, they say if he lets up all
the food’1l spoil.’’

The smaller one nodded, scratched the side of
his head with his flashlight, ‘‘ Well, Riley’ll be back
tomorrow and all I got to say is, he just isn’t going
to believe what Charlie Thornton did.’’

As they padded softly away from the Ice Plant
windows, inmate Charles Thornton stretched up his
heavy six foot frame, but stopped painfully short as
the hook of over-strained muscles in his back caught
him. His vision clouded and his head spun. The
fatigue he felt was so heavy that he had difficulty
focusing his eyes. Perhaps he could afford another
ten to fifteen minute nap in his chair... . and, thank
God, this was the last night of it!

The next day, the three week epic did end and
Charles Thornton stumbled to his cell and sank wear-
ily in a heap on his cot.

This afternoon I talked with this inmate. I
talked with his overseer, Chief Engineer Riley.
From Thornton I received a modest account. But
Mr. Riley was beside himself with praise. The
whole story goes something like this: :

Charles Thornton entered E.S.P. in March 1954
to serve a term of 314 to 10 years imposed in Dela-
ware County on charge of Burglary. Hired by Mr.
Riley in the Ice Plant, he was a complete greenhorn
as far as ice making was concerned. But a strange
thing happened: inside of 18 months,—that is, by
the time of the great breakdown incident—Thornton
had learned refrigeration just about from A to Z.

He dug out library textbooks; he absorbed the books

Charles Thornton

owned by Mr. Riley. He experimented and tink-
ered, repaired and overhauled to learn the practical
end of the business, all under skilled supervision.
Lastly, as he puts it,‘‘I was never afraid to ask ques-
tions. As far as the mechanical end of it, I was all
right; but on the ammonia receiver and ammonia

condenser, I needed special help. I bothered Mr.
Riley with my questions and I’m sure grateful the
Night Engineer, Mr. _ McLaughlin, had the patience
to put up with me.’

Mr. Riley states that he went ‘‘all out’? in
helping Thornton learn the trade of refrigeration
for the simple reason that he couldn’t do anything
else in the face of this inmate’s drive and eagerness
to learn. Says Riley, ‘‘Thornton’s application to
his job is unsurpassed. Today, he knows it from the
bottom up and I definitely believe that he is quali-
fied to operate any ice plant on the outside, of a
similar capacity to ours—25 ton per day.”’

The Ice Plant at E.S.P. consists of an ammonia
brine system. Ammonia being in its natural state
a gas, for refrigeration purposes is contained under
high pressure as a liquid. Upon expansion, or the
opening of what is commonly called an expansion
valve, the escaping gases have a temperature ap-
proximately 28 degrees below zero. This extremely
cold gas is piped through coils submerged in brine.
The brine, in a transfer of coldness, is then pumped
through various refrigerators—7 large walk-in jobs
seattered throughout the institution—bringing about
the transfer of heat. The brine, in turn, in return-
ing to the Ice Plant goes through the same cycle.

The ammonia gas temperature being tempo-

_rarily raised through contact with the brine returns-

to compressors and is compressed to a still higher
degree and then cooled, going back to the original
state of liquid. - Roughly, this is the ee of. events
in an ammonia brine system.
