poses and how it is attained, let’s assume that this
prisoner develops a sincere desire to become re-
habilitated so that when he is eventually released,
he will be able to live a normal and respectable,
law-abiding life.

If, after having served six years of his minimum
sentence of 10 to 20 years, this prisoner has contin-
uously shown sincere evidence of complete rehabil-
itation, is society or this prisoner serving the pur-
poses of rehabilitation by his being kept incar-
cerated until he has served those four remaining
years of his 10 year MINIMUM sentence?

I am fully cognizant of the fact that the pris-
oner has perpetrated a crime against society and
must be punished for doing so, but the gist is that,
even though this prisoner did do wrong, he has
repented, has become completely rehabilitated and
has served 6 years under conditions not conducive
to mental well-being.

By no means am I insinuating that the system
of good time be installed in this State for the sole
purpose of remuneration for rehabilitation. Al-
though technically it could be interpreted that way
in some degree. However, the main purpose for
such a suggestion is made with the thought of
giving a prisoner an opportunity for receiving an
early parole if he has shown sincere rehabilitation
during his confinement.

If society throws the ‘‘Book’’ at a person and
completely forgets about him during his immure-
ment, then how can society expect this forgotten
person to show respect towards them and abide by
their rules and regulations when he is eventually
released?

Remember, there are many men who need only
to spend a short period of time incarcerated in
prison before they become completely rehabilitated.
This fact has been proven many times. I must agree
of course, that there are many men in prisons who
will never become rehabilitated. However, why
make the rehabilitated prisoners suffer because of
the unrehabilitated ones?

By now, I imagine that there are many
of you wondering ‘‘how ean anyone determine when
a prisoner is completely rehabilitated?’’ It is my
belief that psychologists, psychiatrists and others
who have studied human behavior all their lives,
can determine this quite accurately through such
means as observing the prisoner’s social attitudes,
daily conduct, expressed beliefs, expressed desires
and daily habits, ete. Therefore, if through such
observance, a prisoner has shown evidence of com-
plete rehabilitation, then we must accept as a fact
that he is rehabilitated and grant him the oppor-
tunity of once more being accepted by society.

Unfortunately, however, at the present time,
society seems to be primarily concerned only with
the thought and habit of sentencing the majority
of law-violators to as much time in a penitentiary
as is possible and forgetting about them. Whereas,
society should be making it its duty to see that
prisoners have advantages available to them for

being released in a sufficient amount of time when
they have shown sincere evidence of complete
rehabilitation. Permitting a rehabilitated prisoner
to be paroled before his MINIMUM sentence has
been completed, would be beneficial to him and to
society in his adjustment among them when he
is released.

Society must be made to understand that it is
much easier to remold a prisoner in the community
among people who will have a sincere desire in
stimulating him to do good, than could be done in
a penitentiary. A moderate term of immurement
for an offender who will have a careful and long
parole supervision when released, is much safer for
society, than if he were given and forced to serve a
severely long sentence, and then released.

If a prisoner is compelled to serve a severely
long sentence after becoming completely rehabili-
tated, there are possibilities that the inmate may
reappraise the inconsistencies of rehabilitation and
maximum sentences and when he is released will
enter society with hatred, contempt and revenge,
irrespective of the amount of parole he has re-
maining or the consequences involved thereafter.
There is nothing more precarious than an ex-convict
loose among society possessing such feelings and
intentions toward society. Such attitudes of an ex-
convict could be eliminated considerably, if society
would give more consideration to a prisoner as an
individual; permit more flexibility in a MODERATE
sentencing procedure and affiliate punishment more
closely with rehabilitation. When such things as
this are done, the advancements in preventing the
return of convicted parole violators will be excep-
tionally rewarding to everyone concerned.

It must be remembered that every judicial law
which deals with persons charged and convicted of
crime has a dual purpose. Namely, to protect the
community against such persons committing any
further criminal activity against them, and to try
to rehabilitate them to the fullest extent possible
during their confinement. If severe and improper
practices are used against a person in the legal
process, considerable harm will be committed in pre-
venting the ultimate possibilities of a person be-
coming rehabilitated while in prison. If a prisoner
has such a severe amount of time to serve that he
cannot see any future hope of release, then he has
NO reason nor any desire for rehabilitation.

If the courts and society are opposed to the
release of a completely rehabilitated prisoner just
because he has only served 6 years of a 10 to 20
year sentence, then what is the purpose of urging
rehabilitation to prisoners, especially if the prison-
ers are not to receive any consideration for ac-
cepting it?

_ If we are going to have continual preaching on
the subject of rehabilitation, then let’s also have
SOMEONE do SOMETHING in obtaining a sentenc-
ing system which will permit the prisoners who
ARE rehabilitated to be RELEASED in a REASON-
ABLE amount of time.
