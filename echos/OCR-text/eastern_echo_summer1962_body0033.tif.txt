ists and arrangers Fats Waller and Horace Hender-
son; trumpeters Rex Stewart, Tommy Ladnier, Hen-
ry “Red” Allen, Joe Smith and Roy Eldridge; clar-
inetist Buster Bailey; saxaphonists Russell Procope,
Benny Carter (who also arranged), Ben Webster
and Chu Berry; trombonists J. C. Higgenbottom,
Benny Morton, Claude Jones and Dickie Wells;

drummer Sid Catlett—to name only the best known.

At the very time—in 1932-33—-when the style
was finally perfected, however, work began to get
very scarce and through John Hammond, Hender-
son was introduced to Benny Goodman. Goodman's
new orchestra needed arrangements and Henderson
became Goodman's chief arranger, although for
some years he also tried to keep together a band of
his own.

There were many highly talented big-band ar-
rangers during the swing period, of course, but they
all owed a basic conception and many of the details
of the music to the work of Redman and Henderson.
Some arrangers put the ideas to a very personal use
and one particularly worth mentioning is Sy Oliver.
Oliver was chief arranger for the later Tommy Dor-
sey band after having worked several years for Jim-
my Lunceford. Today one can also hear the influ-
ence of Redman and Henderson in the work of such
diverse talents as Gil Evans, Quincy Jones, Ernie

Wilkens and Neil Hefti.

Redman and Henderson made a big swing band
out of a conventional dance band and there were
other approaches employed in the thirties. One of
these was the idea of a big “‘Dixieland”’ group. Both
Goodman and Tommy Dorsey had toyed with this
idea in their earliest days, using the help of an ar-
ranger named Deane Kincaide. The early Woody
Herman band was also a big ‘‘Dixieland”’ group.
But the most successful was the Bob Crosby orches-
tra. Crosby himself was the front man—he stood
there and smiled and waved a stick and his real func-
tion was an occasional song. The Crosby book was
provided by the band’s director Gil Rodin and the
arrangers including Matty Matlock and Deane Kin-
caide.

Duke Ellington learned from Redman and Hen-
derson too, but he abndoned the dance band idea
and started all over again for himself—and his con-
ception proved to be the most brilliant and lasting

of all.

Ellington has been a major Jazzman for over
thirty years, and his achievements are large enough
to cut across any considerations of period or style.
His was one of the few groups of this period that had
a really original approach to big band Jazz.

Eastern Echo

In 1927, Ellington’s orchestra was hired by the
Cotton Club to provide music for elaborately staged
floor shows. Here Ellington’s talent was released
and he soon found himself with a new sort of band.
In effect, he converted a pit or show orchestra into
a Jazz group. The emphasis fell on refinement of
orchestration, on the integration of solo and group
and on creating varied sounds and textures.

Ellington led the band but everyone contributed.
As he later commented, “The music’s mostly written
down, because it saves time. It’s written down if its
only a basis for a change. There’s no set system.
Most times | write it and arrange it. Sometimes |
write and the band and | collaborate on the arrange-
ment. When we're all working together, a guy may
have an idea and he plays it on his horn. Another
guy may add to it and make something out of it.”’

Ellington has influenced everyone, but he has had
very few successful imitators.

One other band that was inspiring musicians in
1939 was Count Basie’s, and it gave the Goodman
orchestra such pieces as One O’clock Jump, Sent for
You Yesterday, and Jumpin’ at the Woodside. But
in Basie’s orchestra—with its special kind of light
swing and the nearly revolutionary ideas of some of
of its soloists, particularly Lester Young—-we hear
the beginning of a new kind of music which a few
years later was to become “Modern Jazz.’

The innovations in the Basie band were the
‘““*handwriting on the wall’ for the big swing bands.
Their demise has often been attributed to economics,
but this is only half the reason. By the late thirties
the swing style had made a musical summary of 15
years of Jazz. Great numbers of bands had spread
the word and popularized the music. The work of all
but the very best big-bands was done. Artistically, it
was time for something new and that came from the
individual soloists wcrking in small groups. Only the
most truly creative bands of the forties could endure
the artistic impact of “Modern Jazz’ and the mount-
ing expense of keeping so many men together.

Today, Henderson and Dorsey are dead. Shaw,
Goodman and Bob Crosby have retired from music,
but Goodman periodically gets out the old book and
forms a new band to play it again. Don Redman’s
chief occupation is writing arrangements for Pearl
Bailey, and Ellington? Well, of course he still leads
the best big band in Jazz.
