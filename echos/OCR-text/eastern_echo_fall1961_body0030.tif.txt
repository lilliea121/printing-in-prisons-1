Around the Yard or Who's Who im Sports

by Dannny Gudacker

On a little patch of grass, the nine block lawn,
several hardy souls are doing the maneuvers known
as gymnastics. Leading the tumblers is little Nick
the Greek, with Stan Moroz, and Tony Romano
doing back flips all over the green. Dave Gibbs,

Jim Cook and Dick Williams are also making like
bouncing balls.

Ten paces to the right and a group of elder states-
man turn their backs on such happenings and con-
centrate on the domino stones. Olâ€™ Noisey Baker
puts his luck on the line when playing against such
upstarts as Mike Smith, Paul Rhine, and Gus De-
Moss. Reds Lehman is content to watch and kibitz.
Stumbling over the chess tables and Marty Pearson,
we hit the nine block court. Prominent person-
alitys on this block of cement answer to the names
of Charley Dion, Sonny Broadhead, Frankie the
Count, and Willie Winters. While these athletes
swat the little ball back and fourth, a sideline crew
of Frank Smith, Bo Breaker, Jim Fleming, Lester
Bromberg and Ed. Brewer give encouragement in
the form of bronx cheers. Usually keeping score,
and very nearsightedly, is Jim White and Whitney
Rosensweig.

On the Italian scene, the bocci courts, are such

fine pisanos as Little Stosh, Big Nose Eddy, Knobby,
Winkler, Andy, and Peppers.
Notice the quiet reserve with which they scream.
More secluded in their views are Mike Hudak, Jim-
my Nails and Barkley. The judicious one, Greb, is
on hand to settle disputes, while Walter Davis puts
in his time looking for fish. Organizing the games
we have Marshall Peppers, genial M.C. Lou keeps
the court in tip-top shape besides playing one of the
better games of bocci. Insuring a supply of players
we welcome J. D. Ditters and Bob Mangini back to
the wall.

Moving past the members of the two block Au-
dubon Society, headed by Library Joe, we hit the
three block handball court. Paul Henry, Stonewall,
Bernard, Paul Smith, Reds, Jewels, and Jack are
the members of this tough court. Built on a slant
and tucked in a corner, its a wonder how these cats
can move.

The Volleyball court in back of the storehouse
has so many players that it would require a tele-
phone directory to list them. Big George Saunders
is one of the past masters of this game and certainly
Bottle-neck Smith, Hubert, Hooks, and Cleve de-
serve mention for the enthusiasm they put into the
game.

A stene throw away from the volleyball court is
the five block handball oasis where some of the
institutions best players put on a display. Leonard
Massey, Ed. Wallace, Pitts, Foots, and Big Mac are
some of the regulars. Lucky Jackson, Nick Nickens,
