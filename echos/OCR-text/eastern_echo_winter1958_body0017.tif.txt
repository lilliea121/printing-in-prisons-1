I swallowed the great lump that came to my
throat as the little girl spoke.

“No,” I replied. “Where did she go?”

“T don’t know,” she said sadly, ‘““She’s been gone
a long, long time.”

This statement caused me to give the matter my
full attention, and when the little girl crawled upon

the bench to sit close beside me, I was profoundly
touched—not knowing that the strange feeling that
passed over me was paternal and protective. My
cold heart grew soft and warm as the little girl
slipped a tiny thumb into her mouth and gazed up
at me with blue, sparkling eyes.

For the first time in my life, I experienced a
deep human emotion. I slipped a heavy arm about
the little form beside me.

‘Don’t worry precious,” I whispered, “Your
Mommie will return soon.”

An hour passed and the little girl slept. I had
taken her on my lap when she fell asleep. Drinking
in the beauty of the little head pressed to my chest,
I felt a light tap on my shoulder. Looking up, a
uniformed policeman stood before me.

“You've been here a long time, buddy,” the of-
ficer said, “Waiting for someone?”

“Veg Officer, the little girl’s mother.”

“You her father?”

T nodded. It suddenly occurred to me that the
proper thing to do would be to tell the officer that
the little girl had obviously been abandoned, but my
attachment would not let me do so. At that mo-
ment, I felt of some importance, this magnified my
responsibility. I tightened my arms about the sleep-
ing infant.

“Tt does not look like her mother is going to
come after all,” I said to the policeman.

“Better take her home and put her to bed,” the
officer advised.

The little girl awakened as I rose to leave. “Is
my Mommie back yet?” she asked with infantile
concern showing in her doll-like face.

“No, Honey, we will look around the station
for her. You watch good and maybe we will see
her

I searched the terminal without success, and
asked all the employees about the missing mother,
but no cone could remember anything about her, or
give me even a vague clue as to her whereabouts.
Thad obtained some information from the girl. Her
mother, she told me, was pretty. I found a key in

the little girl’s coat pocket while she had slept, and
this discovery left no doubt that the little girl had,
indeed been deserted. I took the small traveling case
from the locker, picked up the infant and walked
out of the station.

“She will not spend Christmas at a police sta-
tion if I have anything to do with it. Perhaps I can
locate her mother before morning.”

I took the little doll to my bachelor apartment,
and after filling her with milk, tucked her in the
big bed. I sat in the living room and went through
the small traveling bag. The first thing I discovered
when I opened the bag was a large photograph.
Holding it before me for a moment, I decided that
it was a picture of the infant’s mother, and that she
was indeed pretty, just as her daughter had claimed.
I turned the picture over, a habit that nearly every-
one has after looking at a photograph for the first
time, and read the note written in a small, neat hand-
writing :

Dear Friend: Iam leaving my daughter
in the station. I know that some kind
person will find her. And I know that she
will be loved and eared for. She is an
affectionate and intelligent child. Her
father was killed in an automobile acci-
dent the day she was born. Give her a
Merry Christmas. God bless you, dear
friend.

I read the brief note twice, looked at my watch
and decided to do some “last minute” Christmas
shopping.

The stores stay open on Christmas Eve. Late
Christmas shoppers still crowded the streets, and
since I was not accustomed to the seemingly mad
activity, I became vexed, when a saleslady, who had
intentionally prolonged my stay at her counter, aft-
er she had noted my anxiety, passed me by to wait
on others who had ganged up at the doll department.
Finally, after a most charming smile, she took my
ten-dollar bill and the huge doll I extended across
the counter. She gave her full attention and hand-
ed me the change. When I left the store, my arms
were loaded with all the playthings any girl-child,
four years of age, could ever dream of. I raced back

to the apartment, and stacked the packages on the

chesterfield and looked around the room. :
“Damm, I’ve forgotten the tree.” I dashed out
and raced down the street. Luck was with me. I
purchased a sizable evergreen tree. When I arrived ~
back at the apartment I also had all the trimmings
