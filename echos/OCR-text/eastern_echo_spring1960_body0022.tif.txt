Maxie Fram stepped quickly but cautiously from
the entrance of the drug store. He had made his
purchase and was in somewhat of a hurry to remove
himself from the area. The light rain had stopped
completely.

“Aiter all,” he thought, “center-city is no place
for a junkie in this town. Especially with a bottle of
‘terp’ in my kick.”

(“terp”) : Elixir of terpin hydrate with codeine
8, COUN SywieuD.

He turned right at the corner, took about three
steps and stopped dead in his tracks. There, standing
not ten feet away and looking him straight in the
eye, stood Detective Sergeant Leo Carter, second in
command of the city’s Narcotic Squad—a belligerent
guy to begin with, and Maxie’s sworn erlemniye alii cyeis
Carter who was responsible for Maxie’s last stretch
in the pen.

“Oh, my gosh,” stammered Maxie. “That ercep.
Out of all the fuz in town, it has to be Carter.”

“Hello, Maxie,’ Carter grinned menacingly,
“long time no see.”

“Hi, Sergeant,” Maxie said with a weak smile.
ST Wes justi”

“Yeh,” Carter interrupted, “I know what you
was just doing. I’ve been watching you for the past
ten minutes through the window. What was it
Maxie, a preseription?”

“No, Sarge. You know I wouldn’t do that. ’m
off the stuff and have been for a long time.”

“WWinait Was wt nen, 2 box elt cough drops?”

“Just a bottle of cough syrup, that’s all—for my
grandfather,” Maxie added.

“Wouldn’t be a bottle of ‘terp’, would it?” the

“As a matter of fact it was ‘terp’,” Maxie replied.
“How'd you guess, Sarge?”

With one lightning-like motion Carter advanced
upon Maxie, snatched him up by the coat lapels and
hawked angrily into his ear. “Listen, you little punk,
I know you're on the stuff again and I know that
bottle of ‘terp’ ain’t for your grandpop.”

“Please, Sarge, you're creasing my lapels,”
Maxie pleaded. “You don’t have to get rough with
me. Give mea break. I ain’t broke no laws—have I?”

“You broke laws all right,” Carter replied.

“Junkies ain’t permitted to buy or use ‘terp’ and you
know they ain’t. And besides, what are you doing in
town in the middle of the day? You’re on parole and
supposed to be working.”

Maxie thought fast. “Why, Sergeant, I was on
an errand for the boss. Had to pick up a package at
the post office.”

“IT get it,’ Carter interjected, “and so the trip
shouldn’t be a total loss; you couldn’t resist picking
up a little something, is that it?”

“No, that ain’t it.” Maxie pretended to be hurt.
“IT told you, Sarge, the ‘terp’ is for my grandpop; he
has a terrible cough.”

“And I told you yow’re a liar. ’m running you
in, Maxie. I think you’re on the stuff again.”

“Look, Sarge.” Maxie was cringing now.
“Please give me a break. I just got out of stir three
months ago. If you take me in they’ll send me back
for sure—even if I beat the rap.”

“Which you won’t,” Carter quickly added. “Ill
lay you two-to-one I can find fresh needle marks on
your arms right now.”

“Please don’t run me in,” Maxie whined despair-
ingly. “You don’t really want me. I’m a nobody.”
Maxie stopped walking and stopped to face the of-
ficer. “Look, suppose I were to tell you about a guy
I know who’s pushing junk. Would you give me a
break then?”

Sergeant Carter’s face became instantly alight
with interest. “Well, Maxie, my boy, now you're be-
sinning to make some sense. If you give me a little
cooperation, ] might just forget I ever saw you to-
Gaye

Maxie was thinking very fast now. “Let’s not
stand out here Sarge, let’s go somewhere and have a
cup of coffee while we talk, O.K.? I'd rather not be
seen talking with you. You can understand that,
can’t you?” He held his breath, praying that Carter
would take the bait.

The detective thought a moment, then smiled
and said: “Sure, Maxie, we’ll have some talk over
coffee, and you can tell me who the guy is I want—
instead of you.”
