times. At least, it upholds the pure intent of the
Constitution and would be an everlasting credit of
the Bar. Penniless and ignorant offenders would
feel—somebody cares! Our Federal Courts have
liberally followed what appears to be the constitu-
tional interdiction. I would even hold that it should
be a mandatory provision to assign counsel in all
cases where imprisonment is involved. No plea
should be permitted until counsel is assigned to the
offender unable to employ a lawyer. How can even
a previously convicted offender, usually of low in-
telligence, be expected to plead to certain technical
indictments, particularly where technical multiple
charges are listed?

The State has every facility at its disposal to
gather evidence and obtain witnesses. Proper pre-
trial work by counsel for the defense is not expect-
ing to much. This should be a conscientious appli-
cation to the assignment. Too often the court looks
over the lawyers available in Court and assigns one
to handle the case, and it is only too frequent that
counsel has only a few minutes prior to the adju-
dication for the defense and preparation of the case.
Certainly this is not ample time to properly discuss
the case with the defendant, to gather sufficient
facts, to check background, and to otherwise per-
form required investigation before a proper pre-
sentation of the case can be made.

This necessity for counsel before plea was for-
cibly brought out several years ago (after 1939)
when not a few men without counsel pleaded to at-
tempted rape and received 73 to 15 years. Yet this
was changed in 1939 by the assault to ravish statute,
providing a penalty of 23 to 5 years. One man
served six years before the error was discovered.
He had no lawyer standing with him to examine this
prior to judgement.

I feel the petitions for habeas corpus would de-
crease sharply if due care were exercised at every
stage of the proceedings with safeguards herein pro-
posed. Parenthetically it might be observed that
a writ of habeas corpus in a high prerogative writ,
that even the Courts cannot refuse to entertain, a
fortiori with which prison officials cannot interfere
at its submission.

Proper investigation of the offender and _ his
background, his mental status and related matters
would prove invaluable to the courts at the time of
adjudication of the case and in the proper disposi-
tion thereof. It is not uncommon that a petition for
the appointment of a lunacy commission must be filed
shortly after reception of a sentenced offender. Ade-
quate laws are available to determine this before a
man is committed to prison and at times goes to the
very heart of the case. Where indicated, by agree-
ment of the prosecutor and defense counsel, is it
not possible for an objective presentation of one
competent psychiatrist to give testimony on the
mental status for the guidance of the court or jury.

TRIAL PHASE

The bar association would perform a tremen-
dous service if steps could be taken to encourage
pre-sentence reports by the probation departments
of the various counties. True, this would increase
budgets but the federal courts now insist on such
reports, finding them indispensable in properly pass-
ing judgment based on the individual. All the
more, progressive writing by men in penal and ju-
dicial areas has stressed the importance of such
reports.

Is it only to remain as lip-service? To ignore
this essential requirement is to negate the very
foundation of good penology and workable parole
systems.

Relative to this, is the current review of sen-
tences on a national scale, the object, to bring some
uniformity in what Judges assess for the same of-
fense. The disparity is appalling, which can be
discerned in prison, the eruicible of comparison.

Competent counsel acting within moral princi-
ples and moral responsibility would strive to bring
forth every possible point for his client without
clouding the waters with rhetoric and erudition
above and beyond the requirements merely for the
sake of establishing his own reputation. One case
stands out in my mind as an example of this pitfall.
A former District Attorney was employed as defense
counsel and apparently he and the District Attorney
did not agree on other matters. The charge was
homicide but the jury was so confused with argu-
ment, exceptions and rules of evidence that the of-
fender could have well been found guilty of first
degree murder where an objective reading of the
testimony indicated voluntary manslaughter or at
worst second degree murder. Fortunately after
several days of trial the defense counsel changed the
plea to guilty of second degree murder and the
court mercifully accepted it and imposed a proper
sentence.

Professor Julius Stone wisely states:

Because attention is concentrated on interpre-
ting the list of exceptions, not only is the require-
ment for relevancy forgotten but the very object
of the original rule to prevent proof of guilt by an
exception is admitted to the broad rule which ad-
mits evidence precisely for the reason that the orig-
inal rule excluded it.

There are some distasteful cases on which an
attorney would prefer not to enter a plea. Cer-
tainly all can’t be ideal but the lawyer, as I see it,
should exert every legitimate and legal effort in
behalf of his client, no matter the case or the plea,
without resorting to sharp practices which lowers
the profession and creates contempt for law. An
offender who expects anything but a legal, moral
and equitable handling of his case is one who will
again become involved in eriminal activity.
