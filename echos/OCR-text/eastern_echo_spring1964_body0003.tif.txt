ABOUT THE COVER: The picture of the little girl appearing on the cover was done
in pastel medium by our own art illustrator, Merton J. Engle. A self-taught artist,
Engle began painting as a hobby in 1952 and is adept in oil, charcoal, pen and ink
and resins. His title for the painting is “First Communion.” Unfortunately, the print,
in black and white does not do justice to the drawing.
