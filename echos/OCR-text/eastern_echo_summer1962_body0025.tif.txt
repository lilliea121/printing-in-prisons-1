With that thought in mind we pull our starting
switch and say “Hello Anybody’”’.

The following is a listing of the various types of
listeners

ROARING 20’s CHARLIE

This guy is forever writing notes to you requesting
records that have been obsolete for 24 years, like,

Stanislaus Kornikovich and his magic glockenspiel
playing “They couldn’t SHOOT him off his horse,
so they CUT him off at the pass’, he wants it played
in D major too. I tried but couldn't find this record-
ing, but discovered later that Stanislaus Kornikovich
and his Magic Glockenspiel with fife, drums and
bugle background music, was real big back in 1916
in Karls Tavern, 311 Willhemstrasse, Kiel, Germany.
So what happens now that | didn’t play his requests?

‘. .. Ya Sabastian.”’

.. Well the next time this guy sees me, he starts
mumbling and all you can hear is ... peasant and
something that sounds like “‘ya sabastian....'° So
you duck your head in embarrassment and move
on... . just in time too, for | heard him clearing his

throat. See what I mean about dangerous?
THE COMMON OR HOUSEHOLD VARIETY

As we say in the trade this guy is the semi-violent
type, he sends 45 or 50 requests for every program
and if you fail to mention his name in connection
with each request his re-actions are semi-violent,
by that I mean, the Disc Jockey can come no closer
to a belt in the puss, in fact, I’d rather have the belt
in the puss then to go around scared to death wait-
ing for it.

Eastern Echo

When this type sees you, he usually remarks,
‘“Whattsa matta big shot, you don’t like me maybe,
if | see ya in the yard, I'll tear you apart ya bum’”’.. .
Usually I just run away when this happens, but if a
guard is near by, I sneer at him, not the guard, the

Clyde that’s beefing.

This is a situation that emanates danger in the
highest degree to a prison Disc Jockey. When this
type meets the D.J. he just stares and stares at you
and you can plainly hear the deep rumblings coming
from his enormous chest. This is also an unnerving

predicament that leads to tics and twitches in Disc
Jockey’s faces, in fact they don’t call me blinkie for

nothing you know.

«|... IT sneer at the Clyde.”

Naturally, when you are spinning your platters,
you try for a little humor in beween records, like
that last record was by Joe Banana and his bunch.
They slip out like that some times. Now I ask you
do you know the risks involved saying things like
that to my type of listener?

600 closely guarded, confined men, confined for
long years, some just refused parole, denied clem-
ency, divorced, girl friends cheating, men over
flowing with the bitterness and frustration of close
confinement and all in an area of a 9x12 cell.....
and YOU cracking jokes to guys like that? .......
You say that isn’t dangerous?

Now in all fairness get a minds eye view of a 6 foot
2 inch, 200 pound inmate with a 3rd grade education
lying in his cell for 12 years (A parole violater, they
brought him back for singing too loud in church) do
you in all honesty think he’s lying there laughing at
a Disc Jockey’s jokes and wise cracks, can you see
him bent over laughing? .... No. I see him gripping
the bars and mouthing obscenities at everyone and
